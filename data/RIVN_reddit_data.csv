1jps2rr_RIVN,RIVN,Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs,"(Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.",2025-04-02,247,89

1jgkgat_RIVN,RIVN,RIVN a quick technical analysis backed by underlying drivers,"This is my first dd post and it’s mostly a look at  the technical chart with some flavorings of qualitative analysis driving this on the back end. No chatgpt and I am highly regarded. 

**First point: reverse head and shoulders**

A. initial low post ipo slide @$11.68

B. one higher low in late 2023 @$15.12

C. ATL early 2024 @$8.26

D. Higher low late 2024 @$9.50

In these 4 points(circled in graph), is developing, somewhat of a reverse head and shoulders pattern, I believe there might be opportunity for breakout, especially after the recent market wide selloff driving higher risk stocks like RIVN down sharply. Confirmation would be around $15-16 and I believe this could bring it to the $20-35 range

**Second point: Descending triangle Sellers meeting buyers floor**

As seen in the chart, there is a clear series of lower highs(blue downward sloping line), and support from buyers around $11. The price has been flirting with the upward trend line, and I believe there are two scenarios. 

1. The stocks goes sharply lower, driven by broader market forces, marking it’s capitulation and goes sharply higher from abysmal lows. 

2. Market trades sideways or upwards and RIVN starts an upward trend more gradually

Either way, I see an opportunity in trading this stock. With it losing $5.3B last year, I can’t convince myself to invest in it as a long term value play (my normal investments), but I can see it as an acquisition target from a bigger auto player or PE (private equity) fund who wants to get skin in the EV game, either of these two giving an insane valuation justification for short term trading. 

I wouldn’t be so confident in this if it weren’t for the, I guess I’ll call it, among other things.. “EV biased administration” and it’s partnership with players like Amazon and VW. 

I’m a buyer in the $7.75 - $9.50 range. Might buy some today just to get some skin in the game as I don’t hate it at $11.35, just don’t love it. 

Also, I think it’s important to note, I’m cautionary with options on this play, especially deep OTM Calls that will be worthless if an acquisition price is less than strike after a 30-40% pop from rumors of M&A (merger and acquisition).

1j9b8fp_RIVN,RIVN,Join the Rivian Revolution: The People’s EV Play Against Tesla’s Empire,"A few years ago, retail investors banded together and turned a certain stock into a symbol of resistance—proving that everyday people can challenge the system. Now, we have another opportunity to make history, this time in the EV market.

Why Rivian? Why Now?

Tesla, once the leader of innovation, has become a corporate giant more focused on price manipulation, undercutting competitors, and propping up its image rather than delivering on its promises. Meanwhile, Rivian represents everything Tesla was supposed to be: a company driven by real innovation, quality craftsmanship, and a commitment to building the best electric vehicles—without the drama.

By supporting Rivian, we can send a clear message:
	•	Support real innovation, not monopolistic control. Tesla has been cutting prices to strangle competition, but Rivian is holding strong. A rally behind Rivian sends a message that people want competition and quality, not market manipulation.
	•	Push back against Wall Street shorting. Certain institutional investors are betting against Rivian, expecting it to fail. If enough buyers step in, we can force short sellers to cover, creating a major squeeze.
	•	Diversify the EV market. The electric vehicle industry should not be dominated by one company. More competition means better technology, better products, and better options for consumers.

The Power of the People

We’ve seen what happens when retail investors unite behind a cause. Imagine thousands—if not millions—rallying behind Rivian, turning it into the new face of independent EV innovation.
	•	Target: Rivian (RIVN)
	•	Mission: Drive demand, push back against short-sellers, and level the playing field.
	•	Outcome: A true competitor emerges, and Tesla faces real pressure.

This isn’t just about a stock—it’s about making a statement. Rivian has the potential to reshape the EV industry, but it needs support from those who believe in a better future.

Will you be part of the movement? Buy Rivian, hold strong, and let’s make history.",2025-03-12,0,12

They lose roughly $39,000 per vehicle sold currently, have $5.74B in debt and $7.70B in cash. TTM net income is -$4.75B.

# Rivian Is Now Selling Electric Vans To Anyone Wo Wants One

After years of being Amazon’s personal EV courier, Rivian’s electric delivery van is officially open for business—to *all* businesses. The EV startup announced that it will now sell its plug-in cargo van to fleet operators of all sizes, breaking away from its Amazon exclusivity deal, which expired in late 2023. But before you get excited about converting one into your dream #vanlife home-on-wheels, there’s a catch—these vans are strictly for commercial buyers.

**More Customers, More Cash?**

For Rivian, this move is more than just a strategic shift—it’s a financial lifeline. The company raked in $742 million from Amazon-related sales in the first nine months of 2024, accounting for nearly a quarter of its total revenue. But with Amazon having only taken 20,000 vans—just a fraction of its original 100,000-unit commitment—Rivian is now opening the floodgates to new customers in hopes of keeping its production lines humming. Fleet deliveries are set to begin in Q2, and Rivian says it will sell as few as one van or as many as thousands, depending on demand.

**A Market Ripe for Disruption**

The commercial EV space is heating up. While Rivian is just now widening its customer base, competitors like Ford’s E-Transit and Mercedes-Benz’s eSprinter are already jostling for fleet dominance. Even General Motors’ BrightDrop—once thought to be a rising star—has struggled with market volatility, forcing GM to bring the business back in-house. Rivian’s edge? Its vans boast higher profit margins than its consumer vehicles, and the company can cash in on software subscriptions for fleet management, sweetening the long-term revenue pot.

**Will It Be Enough?**

Rivian is still battling cost pressures and supply chain hiccups, including a critical parts shortage that temporarily idled production last year. The company is also racing to launch its more affordable R2 SUV, a make-or-break model for its future. But by expanding sales of its delivery vans beyond Amazon, Rivian is making a calculated bet that businesses are ready to electrify their fleets—and that it can carve out a bigger slice of the commercial EV market before the competition fully revs up.

# Trump Plans to Impose 25% Tariffs on Steel, Aluminum Imports

  
Trump is back with his favorite economic sledgehammer: tariffs. The president announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, hitting major suppliers like Canada, Mexico, and the EU—with zero exemptions. The move revives his 2018 playbook but goes even further, doubling down on a protectionist strategy that could rattle global trade. Oh, and he’s not stopping there—Trump also teased “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that impose duties on U.S. goods, set to roll out in the coming days.

**Winners & Losers**  
  
Steel and aluminum stocks popped like champagne at a lobbyist’s victory party. Cleveland-Cliffs surged 18%, Nucor climbed 5.6%, and U.S. Steel jumped 4.8%, while aluminum heavyweight Alcoa saw a 2.2% boost. But it wasn’t all celebration—automakers and aerospace firms are already bracing for higher costs. General Motors slipped 1.4%, while Ford remained flat. Analysts expect steel prices to rise by $150 per ton, meaning manufacturers will be paying a hefty Trump tax.

**Trade War 2.0?**  
  
Cue the diplomatic rage. The EU called the move “unlawful and counterproductive”, while South Korea and Japanare scrambling for alternatives. China isn’t waiting around—it’s already hitting back with a 15% tariff on U.S. energy imports and 10% duties on American oil and agricultural equipment. Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico—Trump’s biggest suppliers—are trying to negotiate their way out of the mess before it tanks their exports.

**Will He, Won’t He?**  
  
Here’s the thing: Trump loves a good tariff threat but doesn’t always follow through. He recently delayed duties on Canada and Mexico, and he’s been tossing around potential levies on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and oil like a game of trade war bingo. So while businesses are gearing up for impact, there’s always the chance that this is just another round of Trumpian brinkmanship. Either way, Wall Street is watching, and global markets are holding their breath.

The EV startup announced that it will now sell its plug-in cargo van to fleet operators of all sizes, breaking away from its Amazon exclusivity deal, which expired in late 2023. But before you get excited about converting one into your dream #vanlife home-on-wheels, there’s a catch—these vans are strictly for commercial buyers.

**More Customers, More Cash?**

For Rivian, this move is more than just a strategic shift—it’s a financial lifeline. The company raked in $742 million from Amazon-related sales in the first nine months of 2024, accounting for nearly a quarter of its total revenue. But with Amazon having only taken 20,000 vans—just a fraction of its original 100,000-unit commitment—Rivian is now opening the floodgates to new customers in hopes of keeping its production lines humming. Fleet deliveries are set to begin in Q2, and Rivian says it will sell as few as one van or as many as thousands, depending on demand.

**A Market Ripe for Disruption**

The commercial EV space is heating up. While Rivian is just now widening its customer base, competitors like Ford’s E-Transit and Mercedes-Benz’s eSprinter are already jostling for fleet dominance. Even General Motors’ BrightDrop—once thought to be a rising star—has struggled with market volatility, forcing GM to bring the business back in-house. Rivian’s edge? Its vans boast higher profit margins than its consumer vehicles, and the company can cash in on software subscriptions for fleet management, sweetening the long-term revenue pot.

**Will It Be Enough?**

Rivian is still battling cost pressures and supply chain hiccups, including a critical parts shortage that temporarily idled production last year. The company is also racing to launch its more affordable R2 SUV, a make-or-break model for its future. But by expanding sales of its delivery vans beyond Amazon, Rivian is making a calculated bet that businesses are ready to electrify their fleets—and that it can carve out a bigger slice of the commercial EV market before the competition fully revs up.

# Trump Plans to Impose 25% Tariffs on Steel, Aluminum Imports

  
Trump is back with his favorite economic sledgehammer: tariffs. The president announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, hitting major suppliers like Canada, Mexico, and the EU—with zero exemptions. The move revives his 2018 playbook but goes even further, doubling down on a protectionist strategy that could rattle global trade. Oh, and he’s not stopping there—Trump also teased “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that impose duties on U.S. goods, set to roll out in the coming days.

**Winners & Losers**  
  
Steel and aluminum stocks popped like champagne at a lobbyist’s victory party. Cleveland-Cliffs surged 18%, Nucor climbed 5.6%, and U.S. Steel jumped 4.8%, while aluminum heavyweight Alcoa saw a 2.2% boost. But it wasn’t all celebration—automakers and aerospace firms are already bracing for higher costs. General Motors slipped 1.4%, while Ford remained flat. Analysts expect steel prices to rise by $150 per ton, meaning manufacturers will be paying a hefty Trump tax.

**Trade War 2.0?**  
  
Cue the diplomatic rage. The EU called the move “unlawful and counterproductive”, while South Korea and Japanare scrambling for alternatives. China isn’t waiting around—it’s already hitting back with a 15% tariff on U.S. energy imports and 10% duties on American oil and agricultural equipment. Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico—Trump’s biggest suppliers—are trying to negotiate their way out of the mess before it tanks their exports.

**Will He, Won’t He?**  
  
Here’s the thing: Trump loves a good tariff threat but doesn’t always follow through. He recently delayed duties on Canada and Mexico, and he’s been tossing around potential levies on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and oil like a game of trade war bingo. So while businesses are gearing up for impact, there’s always the chance that this is just another round of Trumpian brinkmanship. Either way, Wall Street is watching, and global markets are holding their breath.

# Rivian Is Now Selling Electric Vans To Anyone Wo Wants One

After years of being Amazon’s personal EV courier, Rivian’s electric delivery van is officially open for business—to *all* businesses. The EV startup announced that it will now sell its plug-in cargo van to fleet operators of all sizes, breaking away from its Amazon exclusivity deal, which expired in late 2023. But before you get excited about converting one into your dream #vanlife home-on-wheels, there’s a catch—these vans are strictly for commercial buyers.

**More Customers, More Cash?**

For Rivian, this move is more than just a strategic shift—it’s a financial lifeline. The company raked in $742 million from Amazon-related sales in the first nine months of 2024, accounting for nearly a quarter of its total revenue. But with Amazon having only taken 20,000 vans—just a fraction of its original 100,000-unit commitment—Rivian is now opening the floodgates to new customers in hopes of keeping its production lines humming. Fleet deliveries are set to begin in Q2, and Rivian says it will sell as few as one van or as many as thousands, depending on demand.

**A Market Ripe for Disruption**

The commercial EV space is heating up. While Rivian is just now widening its customer base, competitors like Ford’s E-Transit and Mercedes-Benz’s eSprinter are already jostling for fleet dominance. Even General Motors’ BrightDrop—once thought to be a rising star—has struggled with market volatility, forcing GM to bring the business back in-house. Rivian’s edge? Its vans boast higher profit margins than its consumer vehicles, and the company can cash in on software subscriptions for fleet management, sweetening the long-term revenue pot.

**Will It Be Enough?**

Rivian is still battling cost pressures and supply chain hiccups, including a critical parts shortage that temporarily idled production last year. The company is also racing to launch its more affordable R2 SUV, a make-or-break model for its future. But by expanding sales of its delivery vans beyond Amazon, Rivian is making a calculated bet that businesses are ready to electrify their fleets—and that it can carve out a bigger slice of the commercial EV market before the competition fully revs up.

# Trump Plans to Impose 25% Tariffs on Steel, Aluminum Imports

  
Trump is back with his favorite economic sledgehammer: tariffs. The president announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, hitting major suppliers like Canada, Mexico, and the EU—with zero exemptions. The move revives his 2018 playbook but goes even further, doubling down on a protectionist strategy that could rattle global trade. Oh, and he’s not stopping there—Trump also teased “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that impose duties on U.S. goods, set to roll out in the coming days.

**Winners & Losers**  
  
Steel and aluminum stocks popped like champagne at a lobbyist’s victory party. Cleveland-Cliffs surged 18%, Nucor climbed 5.6%, and U.S. Steel jumped 4.8%, while aluminum heavyweight Alcoa saw a 2.2% boost. But it wasn’t all celebration—automakers and aerospace firms are already bracing for higher costs. General Motors slipped 1.4%, while Ford remained flat. Analysts expect steel prices to rise by $150 per ton, meaning manufacturers will be paying a hefty Trump tax.

**Trade War 2.0?**  
  
Cue the diplomatic rage. The EU called the move “unlawful and counterproductive”, while South Korea and Japanare scrambling for alternatives. China isn’t waiting around—it’s already hitting back with a 15% tariff on U.S. energy imports and 10% duties on American oil and agricultural equipment. Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico—Trump’s biggest suppliers—are trying to negotiate their way out of the mess before it tanks their exports.

**Will He, Won’t He?**  
  
Here’s the thing: Trump loves a good tariff threat but doesn’t always follow through. He recently delayed duties on Canada and Mexico, and he’s been tossing around potential levies on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and oil like a game of trade war bingo. So while businesses are gearing up for impact, there’s always the chance that this is just another round of Trumpian brinkmanship. Either way, Wall Street is watching, and global markets are holding their breath.

# Tomorrow

Small business sentiment takes center stage tomorrow with the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, offering a glimpse into how Main Street feels about the economy. The index measures confidence across hiring plans, inflation concerns, and future sales expectations—key indicators of economic momentum.

December’s reading hit a six-year high, thanks to post-election optimism, but with fresh trade tensions stirring, economists expect sentiment to have cooled.

Rivian IPO’d for $78 in November 2021. Fast forward 3 years and the stock is hovering $14.

Bears haven’t raised new concerns, rather echoing the same risks since 2021. The current price reflects those risks.

Some expected catalyst in 2025:

No Dilution & Bankruptcy fears: Risk of diluting shareholders and bankruptcy has been taken off the table with the VW partnership and DOE loan approval.

EDV Partnerships: They’re running pilot programs with several companies like AT&T. I suspect they’ll announce new partnerships as an outcome of the pilots which will help diversify EDV revenue.

R2: In second half of year, we should have much clearer picture of launch date of R2.

Gross Profits: Q4 2024 is forecasted to have positive gross profits. In 2025 on annual basis it should be positive as well (may not be all 4 quarters)

VW investment: Rivian will receive $1 billion of investment if it reaches either two nonconsecutive quarters of $50 million of gross profit or two consecutive quarters of gross profit.

Deepening VW Partnership: VW has ~6B reasons they want Rivian to succeed. They should share more information about this.

Software Updates: Autonomous driving should improve + any new features added.

Sentiment Shift: The sentiment can shift in a heartbeat driving the price up sharply in a short period of time. See SOFI as an example, it was in $6-$8 range for 2 years, then doubled in a year.

Analysts Upgrades (in 2025):
-UBS increased $11 -> $14

1hbrn1w_RIVN,RIVN,I'm still bearish on $RIVN,"Here is why:

1. **Ongoing Losses:** Despite some cost improvements, Rivian still posted a $1.1 billion net loss in Q3 2024. With a growing accumulated deficit of $22.56 billion, profitability seems far off.
2. **Burning Cash and Rising Debt:** Cash reserves have plummeted from $7.86 billion at the end of 2023 to $5.4 billion by September 2024. Meanwhile, debt increased from $4.4 billion to $5.47 billion. That’s a worrying trend for a company not yet profitable.
3. **Declining Revenues:** Rivian’s Q3 2024 revenue dropped 35% year-over-year, from $1.34 billion to $874 million. That’s a steep decline, and while supply chain issues played a role, it raises concerns about demand and execution.
4. **Production Struggles:** Supply chain disruptions led to lower delivery volumes and production issues. Rivian’s reliance on limited suppliers could hurt them long-term in a competitive EV market.
5. **Shareholder Dilution:** Rivian issued more stock, increasing the total shares from 968 million to 1.02 billion in 2024. This dilutes shareholder value, making it harder for early investors to see strong returns.

1hb6wj6_RIVN,RIVN,$RIVN is the new $CVNA ,"Let’s do a concise yet precise DD on this turd machine called $RIVN. 

I don’t want to go into too much details because I feel lazy as fuck and you’ll eventually just yolo your money into some stupid short term option that will make you feel like you’re doing crack while going to $0. Burp. 

Bullish points 

- Gen 2 has a much more cost efficient build that was made very clear by CEO during last earning call. He even said “Block the noise, we are having great progress with our Gen 2…”. If this turn out to be fake then I’ll short it to $0 because using this terminology means business. If he can’t deliver or just lied then he toast. 

- The turnaround story must be real, they must be fighting every second of every day to reduce costs and survive. What did this kind of management behaviour gave as a result for $CVNA ? Don’t start to touch yourself i’m not done yet. 

- The market sentiment is almost at an all time low, and rightfully so as they navigate a bunch of problems they caused themselves by being kind of moronic. The bet here is that they will improve on that aspect and stop shooting themselves in the foot every 2 minutes. 

- The cars are loved by their owners, this is self explanatory, a great product will always win and everything will be done to avoid seing it disappear. 

- The new cars will be a massive catalyst up to their launch if you have the patience to hold for at least 1 full year. The R2 will be a best seller and will absolutely destroy the market in which it will be competing. I would 100% buy one if I could. 

- The cars are US made and in this case the US manufactures are not just fighting Tesla they’re fighting China and a tech US company going bankrupt will not fly with the Trump administration. 

Bearish points will be quick, we all know why it’s a turd 

- Not being gross margin profitable is a crazy achievement for any kind of respected company,  that’s some new regarded level of regardness. 

- They could fail on everything they’re trying to accomplish 

- R2 might just be an other turd machine that doesn’t fit in any market  

- Elon Musk is literally running the country and has people everywhere, maybe he’ll just want to fuck with Rivian even if it’s a net negative for the US 


I have more to say but I just gave you bunch of regards way too much to read at once and I don’t want to fry the 2 remaining brain cells you still have up there.

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

1h0815y_RIVN,RIVN,Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

1gvxea5_AMZN,AMZN,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

And if I haven’t sold you on it, take it instead from this guy who turned $182k into $11.7 million:

(Reuters) -Volkswagen Group raised its investment in Rivian by 16% to $5.8 billion and the two companies said on Tuesday they were launching their previously announced joint venture to develop electric vehicle architecture and software.

The companies said in June that VW would invest $5 billion in Rivian. Shares in the U.S. EV maker rose nearly 4% in extended trading.

The joint venture aims to integrate advanced electrical infrastructure and Rivian's software technology for future EVs of both companies, across all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars, the firms said.

Volkswagen plans to invest the $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027, including an initial $1 billion convertible note.

The Audi-parent will also invest $1.3 billion for intellectual property licenses and an equity stake and up to $3.5 billion in future equity, notes and debt, all tied to specific milestones.

Rivian's Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid and VW Group's Chief Technical Engineer Carsten Helbing will lead the joint venture named Rivian and VW Group Technology LLC.

Developers and engineers in the JV will be based initially in Palo Alto, California with three additional sites under development.

The joint venture will use Rivian's existing tech to launch Rivian's R2 in the first half of 2026 and potentially debut Volkswagen Group models as early as 2027.",2024-11-12,485,72

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

1fqc8f3_RIVN,RIVN,"Rivian Stock , Buy ??? ","Hey everyone,

I’m considering whether or not to purchase Rivian (RIVN) stock, but I’m on the fence and would love to hear your thoughts. With Rivian’s stock dropping significantly since its IPO, I’m wondering if now might be a good time to buy in or if it’s too risky given their current challenges.

On one hand, Rivian has had some positive developments, like their partnership with Amazon to deliver electric vans and the growing interest in their R1T and R1S models. They’ve also recently secured a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen, which might help with cash flow and expansion efforts. Plus, some analysts are still giving the stock a “buy” rating, predicting a potential rebound to around $17-30 over the next year, which would be a solid return from its current price.

However, there are also a lot of red flags. The company has been burning through cash at a rapid rate, losing $1.45 billion in just one quarter this year. On top of that, they missed delivery targets last year, and competition in the EV space is fierce. Some forecasts suggest that Rivian’s stock could drop even further, to around $13 or lower by next year, or even as low as $4 by 2030 if things don’t improve.

For those who have already invested in Rivian, do you think the stock has the potential to bounce back? Or is it likely to continue struggling with production delays and competition? I’m especially interested in hearing from those who have followed the company closely—do you see any key indicators that might suggest a rebound, or is this a risky bet that could lead to bigger losses?

Would love to get your input before making a decision! Thanks!",2024-09-27,40,117

1eq10xi_RIVN,RIVN,RIVN - Analysts Missing The Cash Perspective ,"Rivian is becoming more and more of an interesting play in my opinion. 

They have had gross margin on a per vehicle basis as bad as ~$50K, but are rapidly approaching profitability.

The interesting thing is that if you read the gross margin right off their Q2 balance sheet it says their per vehicle margin is roughly -$30K. But, in the Q/A they actually said if you factor out accelerated depreciation and plant shut downs, etc, they are more like -$14K or better per vehicle.

Their whole goal is to get profitable by December ‘24, and everyone thinks they are still at -30K, but on a CASH basis they are almost there - making up massive ground from -50K to -14K. 

Trading at around 3x P/S (lucid is at 11.8…) with 1) much better efficiency pumping out of their plants after shutting down for improvements in April, 2) VW’s 1 to 5Bn investment in Rivian for their software, 3) a good chance of being profitable this year, which is being massively discounted by analysts not looking at things on a cash basis, seems like a very strong investment opportunity in my opinion. 

Oh and btw, they are #1 in owner satisfaction. The cult-like following of this brand is unmatched, so many disillusioned Tesla owners changing over (just read any forum or listen to any podcast). To use the phrase from “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” — this is a company that can have a castle built in the air by analysts, conservationists and outdoorsmen/women. ",2024-08-12,12,11

Both companies are set to benefit from this major partnership that could reshape the entire EV industry as we know it. 

At first glance, the Volkswagen and Rivian partnership seems like an odd pairing, however, when considering two major facts, this development makes complete sense. 

1. Volkswagen has struggled with EV development and needs Rivian’s engineering expertise.
2. Rivian is low on cash and is desperate for a much-needed cash infusion. 

# The Partnership

Let's look at Rivian first. 

The EV company has struggled to turn a profit even as sales have increased for two of its most popular vehicles: the R1S Sport Utility and the R1T truck. 

The final quarter of 2023 saw a car production and delivery record but reported losses of more than $600 million. During this period, the company delivered 14,000 cars but is evidently bleeding money. 

Not only would a cash infusion help stop the bleeding, but streamlining costs and operations may help lower losses. Since beginning operations in Germany before World War II, Volkswagen has grown into a global powerhouse with over 114 production facilities worldwide. They have been in the industry and know the ins and outs better than most vehicle manufacturers. They are the perfect partners who will know how to lower costs without compromising on quality. 

However, Volkswagen isn’t perfect either. For the first quarter of 2024, Volkswagen has brought in over $80 billion dollars in sales. This is about 67 times larger than the revenue generated by Rivian during this same time period. Even though Volkswagen is Goliath and Rivian is David, the company has struggled with the transition to EVs and hybrids. Massive supply chains and infrastructures weren’t able to save EV sales from falling slightly in 2024. 

# So how will the deal work?

Companies are learning from Tesla’s example of building out internal software for their cars rather than relying on third-party companies. The partnership will focus on the development of internal software used to operate EVs. 

Why is this important?

Because improved software will lower production costs and accelerate advances in new products. 

The theory is that the savings gained from software improvements could help Rivina erase its losses and reach an even wider market with new offerings. This, in turn, would allow Volkswagen to produce more competitive electric vehicles with better software. 

It's a win-win.

# What does this mean for the EV industry?

Analysts expect the EV industry to grow over the coming years, with sales quintupling by 2030 and accounting for over 40% of vehicle purchases in the world. The companies that are at the head of this space will be the real winners of the overall car industry. 

Currently, the market is divided among fierce competitors. We have companies that exclusively focus on EVs, such as Tesla and Chinese carmaker BYD. These companies are known for their advances in the EV space and are currently leading the industry. However, deep-pocketed legacy companies aren’t willing to back down that easily. With heavy investments in the space, they have been able to slowly but surely begin to close the gap to the new incumbents. 

Ford, GM, and Stellantis have invested tens of billions into EV development. Volkswagen's partnership helps the German automaker match the scale of investments taken up by its peers.

1dp4z0m_RIVN,RIVN,"Taking a closer look at the Rivian, Volkswagon partnership","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) and Volkswagen Group (VWAGY) have announced a significant joint venture that includes a substantial investment by Volkswagen in Rivian. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of software and electrical architecture for both companies, combining their strengths to lower costs per vehicle and enhance innovation on a global scale. Rivian's advanced zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform will form the foundation for this collaboration, which will benefit both automakers as they develop new vehicle models in the latter half of the decade.

Volkswagen plans to invest up to $5 billion in Rivian by 2026, starting with an initial $1 billion through an unsecured convertible note that will convert into Rivian’s common stock under certain conditions. This investment will help alleviate concerns about Rivian's financial stability, particularly given the company's recent losses and workforce reductions. The partnership will enable Volkswagen to leverage Rivian’s existing electrical architecture and software platform in the short term, while both companies aim to roll out vehicles utilizing the joint technology in the future.

First and foremost, the investment bolsters Rivian's liquidity, providing a lifeline to the startup as it navigates the challenges of scaling up production. The $7.858 billion in cash, augmented by Volkswagen's infusion, transforms the company's financial position, ensuring a solid foundation for the development of its R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. By addressing short-term concerns, the joint venture paves the way for a more sustainable growth trajectory.The strategic benefits extend beyond capital. Rivian's cutting-edge technology, particularly its zonal hardware design and electrical architecture, becomes a valuable asset for Volkswagen. This integration accelerates both companies' software development, enabling them to create more efficient and cost-effective EV solutions. 

As a result, the partnership fosters a competitive edge, with both entities set to disrupt the mid-to-high-end segment of the market.The deal also implies a shift in market dynamics, as the collaboration signals a shift from standalone competition to a more cooperative model. Smaller EV manufacturers may feel the pressure to either enhance their own technology or explore similar strategic alliances to maintain their relevance. Legacy automakers like Volkswagen, now armed with Rivian's technology, are no longer spectators in the race for electric dominance.However, while the partnership is a game-changer, it's crucial to note that it doesn't guarantee an immediate turnaround for Rivian. The company must still execute effectively on its production optimization and cost structure improvements, as evidenced by the retooling efforts and efficiency initiatives mentioned. The future profitability of both parties will hinge on the successful integration and the ability to deliver on the promises of the joint venture.

Market reaction to the deal has been notably positive for Rivian, with its stock surging up to 50% in after-hours trading. Analysts have hailed the partnership as a game-changer, with Wedbush Securities raising its price target for Rivian's stock and highlighting the significant boost to Rivian's financial health and future prospects. Conversely, Volkswagen's stock saw a slight dip due to concerns over the size of the investment and its struggling software subsidiary Cariad. ",2024-06-26,6,8

Rivian (RIVN) is poised for a surge, with the recent $5 billion investment from Volkswagen acting as a major catalyst. Here's why this could push the stock towards $30 in the near future:

* **Vote of Confidence:** Volkswagen's hefty investment is a resounding endorsement of Rivian's technology and future potential. This validation from a giant automaker significantly boosts Rivian's credibility and market confidence.
* **Cash Flow Lifeline:** The $5 billion provides much-needed capital for Rivian to ramp up production and expand its reach. This financial stability allows Rivian to focus on growth without the immediate pressure of cash burn.
* **Shared Expertise:** The partnership with Volkswagen fosters a powerful knowledge exchange. Rivian gains access to Volkswagen's vast manufacturing experience, while Volkswagen benefits from Rivian's innovative EV technology. This collaboration could accelerate development and innovation for both companies.
* **EV Market Momentum:** The electric vehicle (EV) market continues its strong growth trajectory. With rising gas prices and increasing environmental concerns, consumer demand for EVs remains high. Rivian is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
* **Short-Term Boost:** The initial surge in pre-market trading after the Volkswagen news highlights the market's positive reaction. This momentum could continue in the coming days, pushing the stock price closer to $30.

While predicting the exact stock price is inherently challenging, the Volkswagen partnership injects significant optimism into Rivian's future. With a strong tailwind and strategic collaboration, Rivian's stock price has a compelling case to reach the $30 mark within the near term.

**Important to Consider:**

The stock market is dynamic, and external factors can influence Rivian's performance. Keep an eye on overall market trends, production updates, and any potential challenges Rivian might face.

1doflcw_RIVN,RIVN,Rivian shares soar 30% after Volkswagen takes $1 billion stake ,"Volkswagen is taking a $1 billion stake in electric vehicle startup Rivian, which has been seeking to cut costs and shore up cash amid slower-than-expected adoption of EVs.

The companies announced the deal after markets closed Tuesday – two days ahead of an investor event for Rivian, which has been under pressure from Wall Street due to its cash burn and significant losses.

Volkswagen is now the second legacy automaker to take a stake in the California-based company. Ford Motor was among Rivian’s largest stakeholders, at roughly 12%, alongside Amazon when Rivian went public in 2021. The Detroit automaker sold a majority of its Rivian shares by 2023 after walking back a plan to codevelop EVs with the company.

Rivian reported a loss of $1.45 billion during the first quarter of this year, as it retooled its plant in Normal, Illinois, to launch updated versions of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV EVs ahead of its next-generation vehicles in 2026.

The company has been on a cost-cutting mission for months. It has trimmed staff, retooled its Illinois plant to increase efficiencies and paused construction of a new multibillion-dollar factory in Georgia. That last measure is expected to save more than $2.25 billion in capital spending, including the impact of starting production of Rivian’s next-generation R2 vehicle at its plant in Illinois.

Rivian reported $7.86 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to end March, with more than $9 billion in total liquidity.

1cmlgq3_RIVN,RIVN,"Rivian reports mixed Q1 results, but trims capex forecast and sees Q4 'gross profit'","Rivian (RIVN) reported mixed quarterly results for the first quarter, but will see further cost savings from shifting its upcoming R2 production to its Normal, Illinois, plant and trimmed its capital expenditure forecast. The EV-maker also reaffirmed its full-year loss forecast, and still sees a ""path"" to ""modest gross profit"" in the fourth quarter of this year.

For the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.204 billion versus $1.175 billion expected, which is an 80% jump from a year ago. However, Rivian posted an EPS loss of $1.45 versus $1.27 estimated, with an operating loss $1.484 billion compared to $1.299 billion loss expected.

Rivian reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA loss forecast of of $2.70 billion for 2024, but now sees its capital expenditure (capex) outlays improving to $1.2 billion from $1.75 billion seen earlier due to moving the start of R2 production to its Normal, IL plant, with further capex savings seen in 2025 and 2026.

""We hit several milestones this quarter, including producing our 100,000th vehicle in Normal, successfully navigating the retooling upgrade, and unveiling our new midsize platform which underpins the R2, R3, and R3X,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement.

The company also said as a result of its retooling upgrade and other improvements, Rivian remains ""confident in its path to achieving modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year.""

By shifting R2 production to its existing US factory instead of its upcoming Georgia factory, Rivian said on Tuesday the company will save more than $2.25 billion with the move. The company now sees its Normal capacity following the R2 launch and plant changes to hit 215,000 units of total annual capacity across all vehicles, which includes up to 155,000 units of the R2.

In terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it had $7.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter.

Last month the company reported first quarter R1T and R1S production of 13,980 and deliveries of 13,588, topping expectations of around 12,400 units. The company also reaffirmed production guidance of 57,000 vehicles in 2024.

Part of bringing down those costs came in the form of a 10% salaried staff reduction, with the company citing economic uncertainty. Though Rivian reaffirmed its forecast to reach “modest gross profit” by the end of 2024, Rivian didn't reiterate past statements that it was ""very close"" to achieving a positive contribution margin at the end of 2023.

Earlier this year Rivian said its Georgia factory development is suspended for the moment, though Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe reaffirmed the company wasn’t abandoning the project.

Scaringe said once the R2 was ready for a larger rollout, the upcoming Georgia facility would handle the rollout. The company also said it would be launching its R2 in Europe, which would be a huge market for the company as it's not currently selling its larger R1 vehicles on the continent.

If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who’s smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend’s Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you’ll have Tesla robotaxis.  You’ll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it’ll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That’s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that’s 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I’m buying this stock any price below $294.

1bru798_RIVN,RIVN,Rivian as a Value Investment,"Rivian (RIVN) is a loss making EV start-up (it net losses were $1.5 billion in 2023).  However it is now selling close to its Tangible book value.  (TBV per share is $9.49 vs. share price of $10.96).  Management expect the company to turn profitable by the end of the year.  My thesis on Rivian rests on the following.

New equity investors who are now buying the shares are getting the benefit of over $11 Billion of ""sunk equity"" which has already been spent on the start-up. This equity came from the IPO in 2021 at $78 a share. Now you are getting the same at $11. And this does not count the ""latent goodwill"" accumulated of technology, design and organization. The company has 2 models on the market and will be coming out with a mass market Model in the $50K range next year which could be a game changer.

If the company survives, we as new shareholders get the benefit of this sunk equity- of course if it does not, we get zero.

The company has made huge progress from its IPO but is now selling for 1/8th price.

From same plant maximum car has to be produced. For that minimum time shall be fixed up. But now robots can do multiple works. Elon is right. Executive team has to live in plant.

Been looking at RIVN for a long time now. They’ve officially bottomed… All the headlines… Now is the time. We always see headlines like this when they’ve bottomed as well:

And when we are talking about the quality of the product… Rivians are world class. There is not another electric vehicle on the market that is better in my opinion.

I see a great opportunity here at RIVN bottom. All the fuss in the media about their financials simply is an extreme overexaggeration.. They have the cash and resources to continue their growth and ESPECIALLY with the R2 dropping March 7th, 2024! Take a look at production and vehicles delivered, rapid growth quarter on quarter. Even take a look on the roads, I constantly see Rivians around, they’re here to stay!

1axfu2c_PANW,PANW,PANW vs RIVN put prices,"Hello! I noticed a big difference between the increases in put prices between PANW and RIVN after their earnings. Here are some details:

**PANW** (earnings on 2/20)

Implied move before earnings: 10%

Stock price change after earnings: -28%

Biggest increase in put price across all the strike prices at the peak (expires 2/23): **75000%**

Implied move before earnings: 7%

Stock price change after earnings: -28%

Biggest increase in put price across all the strike prices at the peak (expires 2/23): **760%**



As you can see, both stock dropped by about 28%, but PANW (although having a higher implied move) put prices went up significantly higher than RIVN's. Note that I'm looking at all the strike prices for the puts, and the most profitable puts for both tickers were equally out of the money percentage wise. What is causing that big difference then?

My concern is that the situation will escalate: Rivian lost $43,372 for every vehicle delivered in Q4 2023, marking an increase from the $30,000 loss per vehicle in Q3. Moreover, they are on the brink of introducing a second unprofitable car. It's a situation of scale or perish. The GA plant is on hold due to a lawsuit, and the company has announced a 10% workforce reduction. Regarding car warranties, what happens when brands like Rivian, which lack dealership networks, face no prospects of acquisition, raising concerns about their ability to honor warranties before depleting their financial reserves?

Before I go further, this is just a discussion post, not necessarily a “technical analysis”.

Full disclosure, I’ve just recently yeeted into a decent chunk of my portfolio into Rivian averaging $15.50/share.

Yes, they keep asking for offerings for multiple billions of dollars in new funding, but it’s for the right reasons, and theoretically the correct results of in just a few years increasing their production capacity from 25k to over 500k. It takes massive capital to due this feat. Something I don’t think any other EV brand outside of TSLA is able to do, while also having the most superior product in the industry. 

The even better news being the demand has only skyrocketed, and (hope I don’t jinx it with upcoming quarterly report) there doesn’t seem to be signs of slowing demand. Which is huge because right now their cheapest car is $80k, and they’re soon announcing their $40k line that should supplement their existing $80k lines and commercial delivery truck lines to hit their max 500k capacity.

To me, my yolo bolo brain. It does not seem like a bizzare bet that in 2026 they sell at their 500k capacity as their popularity within the United States is still climbing, and launching an affordable line is only going to increase interest. 

Not to mention it’s a severely superior car to any Tesla line, and SUV/Trucks are largely preferred over sedans in the wealth class that can afford these vehicles in the U.S.",2024-02-09,46,65

But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  
  
I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.  
  
Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. 

# Point #1 – Big Picture - EV’s Will Win… Guaranteed.

Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:

1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.
2. Government’s will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.
3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We’ve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain’t gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.

I know I’m painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go…  
  
Now, just because EV’s will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn’t mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM’s like Ford, GM & Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV’s… right??? Won’t Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope… not a chance. Keep reading and I’ll show you why.

# Point #2 – Pure EV Makers like Rivian & Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers

Ford, GM, and Stellantis don’t stand a chance against Tesla & Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV’s for customers, OEM’s will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian & Tesla. Here is why:

1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs.
2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department than it does selling vehicles. While it generally costs less to service and maintain an EV, collisions & accidents can be more expensive to repair than ICE vehicles. There is a lot of money to be made by repairing & servicing EVs and Rivian has it’s own service department. As such, it will capture that revenue as opposed to giving it to the dealership. This will be another long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
4. Rivian is vertically integrated (especially when it comes to software). Traditional auto companies are not. These companies suck at software. Meanwhile, customers want high quality software in their vehicles that works seamlessly with their phones, homes, and other devices. Rivian, at its core, is a software driven company. This allows them to update their vehicles over-the-air. This will give them an enormous advantage in the long run at improving, iterating, fixing and keeping their customers happy.

Okay, okay, okay… I’ve convinced you that pure EV companies are going to have inherent advantages over traditional auto. That still doesn’t mean that Rivian is going to be a winner. After all… Tesla is crushing them right now. Rivian isn’t even profitable yet. If you’re going to bet on a pure EV, why not pick Tesla???  
  
Tesla is great. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn’t about Tesla. I don’t think Rivian is better than Tesla. It’s not.   
  
This write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian’s stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla.   
  
Anyway, lets continue….

# Point #3 – Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love

Rivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock.   
  
While most people hear the name “Rivian” they think of Rivian’s truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S’s for every 1 R1T.   
  
Now, I see a lot of R1T’s and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That’s a good sign. I’m convinced that middle & upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular….  
  
But the R1S doesn’t just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I’m a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I’m a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit.   
  
Whether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian’s brand is built to last.  
  
Moreover, I really like Rivian’s management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don’t think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola…).  
  
But EVEN if I’m right about everything so far, that still doesn’t mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff….

# Point #4 – Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now

Why would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:

* Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.
* Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.
* Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.
* Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They’ve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.
* Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.
* Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don’t think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me. 

Well all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy… let me tell you why….

&#x200B;

* **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \- If you’ve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017. 
   * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn’t start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian’s “Model S.” It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it’s own Model 3. And that is about to happen.
   * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y – the most popular selling EV in the world. 
   * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.

&#x200B;

* **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian’s loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental. 
   * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.
   * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.”

&#x200B;

* **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian’s demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices. 
   * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing. 
   * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet’s 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that “speculative” stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).

&#x200B;

* **EV’s Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** – Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV’s are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.
   * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV’s will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 & 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I’m confident of that.

&#x200B;

* **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time…** Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV’s to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be “exclusive” with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV’s to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.
   * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that “We’ll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.”
   * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV’s to AT&T. This shot Rivian’s share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.
   * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.

&#x200B;

* **Attractive Price** \- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It’s down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.
   * Rivian’s Value Compared to Competitors – Right now, Rivian’s market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford’s at $44 billion, GM’s at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian’s future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian’s market cap soaring past Ford, GM, & Stellantis in the next three years if it’s R2 launch is successful. 

&#x200B;

* **Tesla Supercharger Access**
   * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America’s EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it’s going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla’s. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore….
   * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.
   * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don’t know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV. 

If you’ve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.  
  
However, this investing thing is not for weaklings….

# Point #5 – Not Gonna Lie… There Are Big Risks:

I’m not some delusional nerd who doesn’t understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:

&#x200B;

* **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**
   * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it’s possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high. 
   * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.

&#x200B;

* **What if there is a Demand Problem?** 
   * It’s possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It’s possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%. 
   * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don’t actually get delivered until January. 
   * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.” I find this explanation pretty satisfying. 
   * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I’m gonna start to get worried.

&#x200B;

* **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**
   * It’s possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the “production hell” issues that Elon Musk talks about. 
   * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.

&#x200B;

* **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**
   * It’s possible that Rivian’s current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better… Absent a really good and logical explanation, I’m going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn’t get somewhere in that range.
   * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.
   * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective. 

&#x200B;

* **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?** 
   * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That’s a ton in capital outlay. 
   * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).
   * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won’t be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it’s a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I’m gonna freak out too.

&#x200B;

* **What if Interest Rates Rise?** 
   * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70’s. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.

&#x200B;

* **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?** 
   * The last big risk is something I don’t hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.
   * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian’s in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers. 
   * I’m not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.

# Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn’t Have to Be)

I feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.

Rivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn’t matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.

The great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV’s.

Tesla’s stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery. Even if Rivian smashes its forecasts for the next two years, Rivian stock will not do what Tesla did. Tesla is so much more than a car company. As it stands, Rivian is just a car company….

But I do believe Rivian could easily get back to its IPO price in the of $70’s if it executes well on its vision over the next 2-3 years. That is what I’m hoping for. 

# Conclusion

I spent all day writing this. I’m tired of typing. I hope someone out there can poke some holes in my thesis so I can sell my shares and put my $$ back into an index fund where it belongs. But I also hope that I’m right and this stock gradually rises in value over the next few years. Right now I’m committed. I’m freaking pumped about it. 

Maybe I’m just dumb and this whole idea is terrible…. If you think I'm missing something, please feel free to tell me in the comments below.

After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that’s what I do with most of my money.  
  
But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  
  
I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.  
  
Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. 

# Point #1 – Big Picture - EV’s Will Win… Guaranteed.

Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:

1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.
2. Government’s will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.
3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We’ve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain’t gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.

I know I’m painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go…  
  
Now, just because EV’s will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn’t mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM’s like Ford, GM & Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV’s… right??? Won’t Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope… not a chance. Keep reading and I’ll show you why.

# Point #2 – Pure EV Makers like Rivian & Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers

Ford, GM, and Stellantis don’t stand a chance against Tesla & Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV’s for customers, OEM’s will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian & Tesla. Here is why:

1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs.
2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department than it does selling vehicles. While it generally costs less to service and maintain an EV, collisions & accidents can be more expensive to repair than ICE vehicles. There is a lot of money to be made by repairing & servicing EVs and Rivian has it’s own service department. As such, it will capture that revenue as opposed to giving it to the dealership. This will be another long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
4. Rivian is vertically integrated (especially when it comes to software). Traditional auto companies are not. These companies suck at software. Meanwhile, customers want high quality software in their vehicles that works seamlessly with their phones, homes, and other devices. Rivian, at its core, is a software driven company. This allows them to update their vehicles over-the-air. This will give them an enormous advantage in the long run at improving, iterating, fixing and keeping their customers happy.

Okay, okay, okay… I’ve convinced you that pure EV companies are going to have inherent advantages over traditional auto. That still doesn’t mean that Rivian is going to be a winner. After all… Tesla is crushing them right now. Rivian isn’t even profitable yet. If you’re going to bet on a pure EV, why not pick Tesla???  
  
Tesla is great. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn’t about Tesla. I don’t think Rivian is better than Tesla. It’s not.   
  
This write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian’s stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla.   
  
Anyway, lets continue….

# Point #3 – Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love

Rivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock.   
  
While most people hear the name “Rivian” they think of Rivian’s truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S’s for every 1 R1T.   
  
Now, I see a lot of R1T’s and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That’s a good sign. I’m convinced that middle & upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular….  
  
But the R1S doesn’t just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I’m a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I’m a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit.   
  
Whether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian’s brand is built to last.  
  
Moreover, I really like Rivian’s management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don’t think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola…).  
  
But EVEN if I’m right about everything so far, that still doesn’t mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff….

# Point #4 – Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now

Why would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:

* Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.
* Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.
* Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.
* Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They’ve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.
* Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.
* Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don’t think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me. 

Well all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy… let me tell you why….

&#x200B;

* **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \- If you’ve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017. 
   * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn’t start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian’s “Model S.” It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it’s own Model 3. And that is about to happen.
   * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y – the most popular selling EV in the world. 
   * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.

&#x200B;

* **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian’s loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental. 
   * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.
   * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.”

&#x200B;

* **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian’s demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices. 
   * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing. 
   * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet’s 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that “speculative” stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).

&#x200B;

* **EV’s Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** – Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV’s are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.
   * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV’s will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 & 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I’m confident of that.

&#x200B;

* **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time…** Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV’s to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be “exclusive” with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV’s to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.
   * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that “We’ll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.”
   * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV’s to AT&T. This shot Rivian’s share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.
   * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.

&#x200B;

* **Attractive Price** \- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It’s down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.
   * Rivian’s Value Compared to Competitors – Right now, Rivian’s market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford’s at $44 billion, GM’s at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian’s future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian’s market cap soaring past Ford, GM, & Stellantis in the next three years if it’s R2 launch is successful. 

&#x200B;

* **Tesla Supercharger Access**
   * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America’s EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it’s going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla’s. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore….
   * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.
   * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don’t know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV. 

If you’ve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.  
  
However, this investing thing is not for weaklings….

# Point #5 – Not Gonna Lie… There Are Big Risks:

I’m not some delusional nerd who doesn’t understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:

&#x200B;

* **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**
   * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it’s possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high. 
   * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.

&#x200B;

* **What if there is a Demand Problem?** 
   * It’s possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It’s possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%. 
   * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don’t actually get delivered until January. 
   * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.” I find this explanation pretty satisfying. 
   * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I’m gonna start to get worried.

&#x200B;

* **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**
   * It’s possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the “production hell” issues that Elon Musk talks about. 
   * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.

&#x200B;

* **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**
   * It’s possible that Rivian’s current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better… Absent a really good and logical explanation, I’m going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn’t get somewhere in that range.
   * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.
   * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective. 

&#x200B;

* **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?** 
   * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That’s a ton in capital outlay. 
   * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).
   * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won’t be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it’s a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I’m gonna freak out too.

&#x200B;

* **What if Interest Rates Rise?** 
   * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70’s. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.

&#x200B;

* **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?** 
   * The last big risk is something I don’t hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.
   * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian’s in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers. 
   * I’m not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.

# Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn’t Have to Be)

I feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.

Rivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn’t matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.

The great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV’s.

Tesla’s stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery. Even if Rivian smashes its forecasts for the next two years, Rivian stock will not do what Tesla did. Tesla is so much more than a car company. As it stands, Rivian is just a car company….

But I do believe Rivian could easily get back to its IPO price in the of $70’s if it executes well on its vision over the next 2-3 years. That is what I’m hoping for.

Tesla is great. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn’t about Tesla. I don’t think Rivian is better than Tesla. It’s not.   
  
This write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian’s stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla.   
  
Anyway, lets continue….

# Point #3 – Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love

Rivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock.   
  
While most people hear the name “Rivian” they think of Rivian’s truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S’s for every 1 R1T.   
  
Now, I see a lot of R1T’s and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That’s a good sign. I’m convinced that middle & upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular….  
  
But the R1S doesn’t just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I’m a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I’m a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit.   
  
Whether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian’s brand is built to last.  
  
Moreover, I really like Rivian’s management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don’t think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola…).  
  
But EVEN if I’m right about everything so far, that still doesn’t mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff….

# Point #4 – Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now

Why would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:

* Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.
* Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.
* Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.
* Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They’ve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.
* Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.
* Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don’t think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me. 

Well all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy… let me tell you why….

&#x200B;

* **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \- If you’ve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017. 
   * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn’t start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian’s “Model S.” It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it’s own Model 3. And that is about to happen.
   * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y – the most popular selling EV in the world. 
   * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.

&#x200B;

* **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian’s loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental. 
   * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.
   * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.”

&#x200B;

* **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian’s demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices. 
   * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing. 
   * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet’s 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that “speculative” stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).

&#x200B;

* **EV’s Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** – Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV’s are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.
   * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV’s will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 & 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I’m confident of that.

&#x200B;

* **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time…** Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV’s to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be “exclusive” with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV’s to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.
   * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that “We’ll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.”
   * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV’s to AT&T. This shot Rivian’s share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.
   * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.

&#x200B;

* **Attractive Price** \- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It’s down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.
   * Rivian’s Value Compared to Competitors – Right now, Rivian’s market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford’s at $44 billion, GM’s at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian’s future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian’s market cap soaring past Ford, GM, & Stellantis in the next three years if it’s R2 launch is successful. 

&#x200B;

* **Tesla Supercharger Access**
   * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America’s EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it’s going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla’s. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore….
   * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.
   * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don’t know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV. 

If you’ve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.  
  
However, this investing thing is not for weaklings….

# Point #5 – Not Gonna Lie… There Are Big Risks:

I’m not some delusional nerd who doesn’t understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:

&#x200B;

* **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**
   * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it’s possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high. 
   * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.

&#x200B;

* **What if there is a Demand Problem?** 
   * It’s possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It’s possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%. 
   * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don’t actually get delivered until January. 
   * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.” I find this explanation pretty satisfying. 
   * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I’m gonna start to get worried.

&#x200B;

* **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**
   * It’s possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the “production hell” issues that Elon Musk talks about. 
   * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.

&#x200B;

* **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**
   * It’s possible that Rivian’s current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better… Absent a really good and logical explanation, I’m going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn’t get somewhere in that range.
   * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.
   * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective. 

&#x200B;

* **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?** 
   * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That’s a ton in capital outlay. 
   * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).
   * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won’t be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it’s a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I’m gonna freak out too.

&#x200B;

* **What if Interest Rates Rise?** 
   * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70’s. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.

&#x200B;

* **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?** 
   * The last big risk is something I don’t hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.
   * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian’s in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers. 
   * I’m not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.

# Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn’t Have to Be)

I feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.

Rivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn’t matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.

The great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV’s.

Tesla’s stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery. Even if Rivian smashes its forecasts for the next two years, Rivian stock will not do what Tesla did. Tesla is so much more than a car company. As it stands, Rivian is just a car company….

But I do believe Rivian could easily get back to its IPO price in the of $70’s if it executes well on its vision over the next 2-3 years. That is what I’m hoping for. 

# Conclusion

I spent all day writing this. I’m tired of typing. I hope someone out there can poke some holes in my thesis so I can sell my shares and put my $$ back into an index fund where it belongs. But I also hope that I’m right and this stock gradually rises in value over the next few years. Right now I’m committed. I’m freaking pumped about it. 

Maybe I’m just dumb and this whole idea is terrible…. If you think I'm missing something, please feel free to tell me in the comments below.

19f3gnb_RIVN,RIVN,$RIVN is definitely a short term large gain BUY right now,"This stock is just going to play ping pong between $13-30 until the R2S/T comes out in 2026 (affordable $40k line instead of their current $80k line that’s an insane waitlist). Jury is out on if the market is hungry for $40-50k line of Rivians, which personally I think it is, but to me the stock sitting at $15 feels like a no brainer short term BUY for something likely to rise 50% and shoot back down to $15 again within 3-6 months. Up until 2026 when the new line comes out, and their production capacity will supposedly go from 25,000 to 500,000 in just 4 years, it’s highly unlikely in my opinion that this stock tanks much more than $13ish/stock. There’s just too much suspense with this stock with its potential up until 2026. Which to me makes this a definite buy, and harvest your gains before they go away again.

Futures are lower this morning following bank downgrades. On the economic front, we saw some FOMC speeches. Philly Fed President Harker suggested the Fed is done with rate hikes. 1,2, and 10 yr US treasury yields are all lower this morning. The VIX is back towards 17 this morning, continuing a recent wake-up in option vol from the mid-summer doldrums. 17 is still below the historical mean but option prices aren't as dirt cheap as they were just a few weeks ago. 0DTE SPY IV for today closed at just 7 yesterday, pricing in less than an 0.5% move, futures are already lower by more than that pre-market so expected an increase in that IV on the open. SPY vol for Thursday and Friday closed yesterday at 11, still low but showing an upward curve. 30-day IV in SPY (at the money) was closer to 14.

Futures are lower this morning following bank downgrades. On the economic front, we saw some FOMC speeches. Philly Fed President Harker suggested the Fed is done with rate hikes. 1,2, and 10 yr US treasury yields are all lower this morning. The VIX is back towards 17 this morning, continuing a recent wake-up in option vol from the mid-summer doldrums. 17 is still below the historical mean but option prices aren't as dirt cheap as they were just a few weeks ago. 0DTE SPY IV for today closed at just 7 yesterday, pricing in less than an 0.5% move, futures are already lower by more than that pre-market so expected an increase in that IV on the open. SPY vol for Thursday and Friday closed yesterday at 11, still low but showing an upward curve. 30-day IV in SPY (at the money) was closer to 14.

The reason I say this is because I feel this would shift much of the recent attention on Rivian back to Tesla if their stock earnings are good as everyone is hoping to see them hit $300 a share.

I feel conflicted because Rivian seems like a promising stock to hold as they are finally starting to get a foothold on the market and turn a profit, plus their truck deal with Amazon. I understand that no one can predict the future of a stock but I’m wondering what the general consensus on this Subreddit is.

14vz6sg_RIVN,RIVN,Why I believe in Rivian (RIVN),"I shall keep this brief as possible because I want to hear everybody's thoughts on this, 

Here are some of the main reasons as to why I'm so bullish on Rivian: 

\- They have an earnings call coming in Early August   
\- Using Amazon's money, they've been able to build the infrastructure for constructing their commercial vehicles + their service vehicles like Amazon's delivery truck, being able to deliver on their contract with Amazon will set them up for future success

\- They're also in talks with Amazon to be able to sell their delivery trucks potentially to other 3rd parties, this opens up another avenue of revenue for them

\- (This one is more of a meme and maybe awareness bias) I keep seeing them around NYC and California and have seen a handful in Miami, I have yet to see a single Ford F-150 Lightning being driven on the road or any other electric truck   
\- The cars are fun and people enjoy them and they serve a nice techno-adventure niche (I can totally see many Jeep drivers converting to this for their off road vehicle); they are geared toward a demographic that values high utility vehicles, I think in the next couple of years people will be heavily choosing to buy either a Tesla or a Rivian  
\- Converting to Tesla's NACS charging standard by 2025 and adopting the Tesla Supercharger network will be huge as they seek to release their lower price point vehicle the R2, which is rumored to be starting close to 40-60K, and will also possibly convince many people who are on the fence about buying a Rivian over a Tesla.  
\- As I saw somebody else on this subreddit mention,  even if the stock returns to it's lowest price point of $12, they still have tangible assets, backing by Amazon, and are actually delivering Electric trucks year over year, for a stock that IPOd at $106, a price of $25 is an absolute steal and I can see it easily going past $40 within the next month.   
\- They just had their best quarter ever in 2023, delivering more than 20,000 vehicles

Rivian results year-to-date in 2023:

* Production: 23,387 (up 236% year-over-year)
* Deliveries: 20,586 (up 262% year-over-year)  


I think this is one of those stocks that people are going to be kicking themselves for not buying more when it was at its lowest point (which I already am).

&#x200B;

# Trading Below Net Assets

Rivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.

Rivian’s market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.

For comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.

&#x200B;

# Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars

Marques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.

Demand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.

There's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.

They’ve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.

&#x200B;

# RJ Scaringe Doesn’t Have To Be A Rocket Scientist

The CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn’t a grandstanding visionary. He’s slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.

When an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.

Rivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.

&#x200B;

# Emeralds Can Crack

Being politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn’t have close friends, is cut off from his family and can’t hold down a relationship. There isn’t a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.

This is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.

&#x200B;

# EV Is Supply Constrained

Last year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.

Meeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.

&#x200B;

# The Bad

Rivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they’d need the share price to significantly recover.

The founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn’t a sign of confidence.

Rivian doesn’t benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn’t as far along with self-driving AI.

Amazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.

&#x200B;

# TLDR

**Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**

**Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**

**It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**

Electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and a lackluster production outlook after the bell Tuesday.

Shares of Rivian were down by roughly 8% during extended trading. The stock closed Tuesday at $19.30 a share, up 4.6% for the session.

Here’s how Rivian performed in the period, compared with analysts’ estimates as compiled by Refinitiv:

Adjusted loss per share: $1.73 vs. $1.94 estimated

Revenue: $663 million vs. $742.4 million estimated

The company reported an adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of nearly $5.2 billion in 2022, narrower than guidance of a $5.4 billion loss in November.

For 2023, Rivian forecast vehicle production of 50,000 vehicles. That would be roughly double last year’s amount but below expectations of roughly 60,000, as estimated by several Wall Street analysts.

“Supply chain continues to be the main limiting factor of our production; during the quarter we encountered multiple days of lost production due to supplier shortages. We expect supply chain challenges to persist into 2023 but with better predictability relative to what was experienced in 2022,” the company said in its letter to shareholders.

Rivian said it expects to achieve a positive gross profit in 2024. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion — a narrower result than the $2.5 billion loss it reported a year earlier. Quarterly revenue of $663 million jumped from $54 million in the year-earlier period when the company had just started making its first products.

The results follow difficult times for the electric vehicle startup that have included slower-than-expected production, unexpected pricing pressure and plans to lay off 6% of its workforce in a bid to conserve cash.

Rivian is focusing on ramping up production of its R1 truck and SUV as well as an electric delivery van it builds for Amazon, its largest individual shareholder.

As of the end of last year, the company had about $12.1 billion in cash remaining, down from $13.8 billion at the end of the third quarter and $15.5 billion as of June 30. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $294 million compared to $455 million during the year-earlier period.

Rivian said while inflation has been a factor in its supply chain, it will continue to take steps to ramp up production and reduce material costs by slimming down its engineering and vehicle design, along with commercial cost-down efforts.

The company’s forthcoming R2 model, for example, will use a simplified assembly and sourcing process to achieve “a meaningfully lower cost structure,” CEO RJ Scaringe said on an analyst call following the earnings report.

He added the automaker is “in a very different position with our supply chain today” relative to a year ago, which will help the company execute on more “aggressive cost and pricing” measures.

“It won’t necessarily be a linear path over the course of the next several quarters but we will start to see those impacts as early as Q1 as we start to reduce the material costs in our vehicles and the technology introductions,” said Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough.",2023-03-01,199,94
11b1k68_RIVN,RIVN,Good time to buy RIVN?,"I have yet to do a deep due diligence on the company, but there are three things that make me want to buy

1. The product look good. I've seen these trucks driving around and they look impressive. They also appear to be well designed and have competitive mileage.

2. The company is supported by Amazon, who has sizable equity ownership and an agreement to purchase 100,000 trucks by 2030. This support, I believe, will help keep the company afloat as the company burns money. 

3. The stock is trading much more reasonably compared to its IPO. It's down 86%, almost at its 52 week low, and no longer had a market cap greater than Ford or GM.

There are definitely downsides and risks
As a startup and an automotive company Rivian will feel pressure as it already has with layoffs. However, it is my belief that because their trucks are so expensive ($75k), their customers will be those in higher income brackets and less susceptible to recession risks, but the auto market I believe has more room to fall. Importantly, the company is burning money with negative operating cash flow. 

To anyone who has done more in-depth due diligence, how do you feel about this? Are there any glaring red flags I've missed?",2023-02-24,4,59

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 3.3% last week, erasing most of the gains made the week before. The majority of the move lower came immediately after a slightly more hawkish-than-expected press conference from Jay Powell following the FOMC rate change and statement. The market rallied on Friday and kept last week’s selloff from being even worse.

The 3.3% move lower was more than the 2.5% move options were pricing. The market has been moving more than options were pricing fairly consistently over the past month. Despite that, vol continued to trend lower, with many of the big earnings reports, plus the FOMC decision now out of the way. However, the election looms this week and that could keep a bid on options for the next few days. 30 day IV in SPY is about 24, with realized vol (actually moves) over the past month around 27. (for reference, realized vol for the past year is around 23, so 27 the past month means the market is volatile, even for 2022)

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of about $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 25. Its lowest levels since mid-September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher. The reasons why are numerous and unimportant is some ways, but from a trading perspective, it means that debit call spreads that buy ATM and sell upside strikes are more favorable than they have been in recent weeks (not to mention they are lower IV overall).

The economic calendar this week has an important CPI number, and of course, the mid-term elections are on Tuesday, with reactions beginning with Wednesday’s session.

Rivian shares sharply dropped Monday after the electric vehicle maker said it was acting with ""urgency"" in voluntarily recalling thousands of vehicles over a possible steering-related hazard. 

The company late Friday recalled 13,000 of its vehicles after a structural manufacturing error was discovered in seven cars. The fastener to the front steering knuckle ""may not have been sufficiently torqued"" when the vehicles were manufactured, Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe wrote in an email to staff that was reviewed by Insider. 

The company's stock fell as much as 11% to $33.30 in premarket trading before paring the loss to 7%. The shares this year have tumbled by about 67%. 

""In rare circumstances, the fastener has loosened fully,"" Scaringe wrote. ""I want to reiterate that this is extremely rare, but it does reinforce why we are acting with urgency and caution.""

tbb6rk_RIVN,RIVN,Rivian shares tumble as supply-chain woes cut production outlook in half,"By Akash Sriram and Paul Lienert

(Reuters) - Rivian Automotive Inc ( RIVN ) warned on Thursday that supply-chain issues could cut its planned production in half in 2022 to 25,000 vehicles, sending shares of the EV maker down nearly 12% in extended trading.

Rivian made about 200 fewer vehicles than the production target of 1,200 vehicles it set for 2021, the company said in a filing in January.

""As we continue to ramp-up our manufacturing facility, manage supply chain challenges, face continued inflationary pressures, and minimize price increases to customers in the near term, we expect to recognize negative gross margins throughout 2022,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders.

Rivian had earlier said it was facing inflationary pressures including mounting component costs, unprecedented supply-chain shortages and delays.

""The 2022 production guidance was disappointing and well short of what they said in their road show, and the fourth-quarter loss was wider than expected,"" said Garrett Nelson, analyst at CFRA Research.

Rivian, other startups and legacy automakers such as Ford Motor Co ( F

) and General Motors Co ( GM

) face tough competition from market leader Tesla Inc ( TSLA

) as they aim to start delivering more electric vehicles in the near future.

The company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.46 billion, or a loss of $4.83 per share, compared with a year-ago loss of $353 million, or a loss of $3.50 per share. It posted revenue of $54 million, well below investors' expectations of $60 million.

As of Thursday's market close, Rivian's share price had dropped about 77% and lost $124.5 billion in market capitalization since hitting its peak after going public in November.

s1hm3q_RIVN,RIVN,Rivian (RIVN) - Summary of Bull and Bear Case,"In light of today's announcement by electric carmaker Rivian that their COO has resigned, I thought it might be useful to see a quick breakdown of the bull and bear case for the stock which I compiled yesterday:

**Bull Case:**

* **High Quality Product -** Rivian's R1T pickup has received rave reviews. Both Motor Trend magazine and Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) (15.2m Youtube subs) said it was the most ""impressive electric truck"" they've ever seen.
* **High Demand -** The company reported in their recent letter to shareholders that consumer pre-orders have increased from 55k to 71k units. Amazon is also a major investor and has pre-ordered 100k delivery vans. These vehicles will have deep software integrations with Amazon's AWS cloud service.
* **Aspirational Outdoor Brand -** The Rivian brand clearly appeals to an affluent demographic who have both concerns for the environment and a love for the outdoors. Google trends data also shows high search interest for Rivian and at one point was at similar levels to searches for rival incumbent, Tesla.
* **Vast Cash Reserves Raised -**
   * $13.7bn from recent IPO.
   * $5bn from the private markets.
   * 1.2bn in convertible notes.
   * Total: almost $20bn!

**Bear Case:**

* **Vehicle Manufacturing Complexity** \- the automobile business is notoriously capital intensive and the manufacturing process is not kind to new car startups. In fact no car startup has survived in the US in the last 100 years (apart from Tesla).
* **Ambitious Product Development and Factory Plans -** Rivian wants to launch 3 different vehicle types at the same time. This is a gargantuan task. Tesla struggled and almost failed on numerous occasions just to deliver one. The company also wants to build and operate two major factories simultaneously. Capital expenditures are likely to skyrocket.
* **Unprecedented Negative Cash Flow -** at the current burn rate, most of the $20bn in cash will have run out in 3 years. Rivian's cash flow statement shows losses of $1.15bn in Q3 2021 alone.
* **Retail Investor Exuberance -** recent stock price movements indicate that retail investors may have rushed into the IPO too fast without understanding all the risks. The stock dropped by 10-20% on news that Amazon plans to buy electric vans from rival Stellantis.  But this was mentioned as a risk in Rivian's S1 filing before going public.

I read about them a year ago, was super excited, saw great customer reviews, but Jesus it has a big mkt cap at $91B. This, as well as the other EV companies to have recently gone public, seem too large to justify an investment. 

I hold Tesla so I’m not a nonbeliever in EV’s or growth stocks, but it seems like the market doesn’t have room for everyone, and  a $91B mkt cap for RIVN seems ridiculous at this point.

Trading case based on valuation and larget market picture. 

MM is leaving the stocks part of a wider tech selloff due to increasing rates that makes banks the right place to be for larger long positions. 

As both $LCID and $RIVN are growth companies with zero production they will both be hit hard by increasing interest rates, and long term investors will chose better paying off investments. 

TA wize: LCID sits on the channel top. RIVN is in a straight trend line down.

Respectivly valued more than VW ( owner of Audi, Seat, Porsche ) and selling more eletric cars every year than NIO. And LCID is now worth more than Ford, which could make sence as Ford for a fact is over valuated it self. 

We probably saw the last fumes of the rally yesterday as MM most likely has finished buying for long term hold, and the WSB crowd peobably poured in on top. Taking profits from these levels would make sence for most investors. And I made a post yesterday during PM about the possibility of a intraday bullcase for one or both.

I’m watching for an short entry in both if one of them shows weakness and higher selling than buying pressure either PM or at open. Puts are rather expensive in both at the moment so a short position is what I favour. If the volume is right I might even keep it foe two days, but timing is important.

qw013h_ZS,ZS,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

 It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house.  

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

**Products**  

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

>R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)

But not all reviews have been positive:

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers. 

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology. 

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.  

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers. 

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology. 

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.  

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

qv8bn1_MS,MS,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house.

 The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders.

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house. 

[The breadth of Rivian’s capabilities \(S1 Filing\)](https://preview.redd.it/gfkweeveqyz71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc417353f583e7f2af48e4d3d65cced0d860eec)

 The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders.

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

qv8fjw_ZS,ZS,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house. 

[ The breadth of Rivian’s capabilities \(S1 Filing\) ](https://preview.redd.it/mllbiwmnryz71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9640090a7fe55263c2122c2687fef9bd89633f2)

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

https://preview.redd.it/re7lokcpryz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea8f81a26a9244e7e9f5d28c22b9bde4474828d

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

But not all reviews have been positive:

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEFywyAMfE24xQMYg33g0Eu_wWCQHaYYXJDTcV9fkpwaDZIOrLTadRZhzeXUCBXJnisaPHfQCX5qBEQo5KhQTPCaeE0Vd2omoZqlAGw2RE32Y47BWQw5PVC9YlQyctNeqGkY-2WYlBTTOPGxH1yvrHec-cUNLzJ7-ADJgYY7lDMnIFHfEPd66T8u_LO9zZYvwAoJw9ZKV4-5onVfnctb-95bhj1fY07rtZ27kaA55ayFZJzRYep4J5kTamTCL0wIzmWH3zcc6S9cBN1W9m8nKfqdMob7A7k-BD8hTbNpfTtSwNNAsnMEr7EcQPDl5NMcs0KC0hz2xqJmsldUCikpk-qlvvklBGWCS0raDT63qfRO_wc8Qo7s), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

[ The shelved Rivian sports car ](https://preview.redd.it/w16x6b4mryz71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc93c80035549ec396c61770797fccf4d1bf4a87)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house. 

[ The breadth of Rivian’s capabilities \(S1 Filing\) ](https://preview.redd.it/mllbiwmnryz71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9640090a7fe55263c2122c2687fef9bd89633f2)

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

https://preview.redd.it/re7lokcpryz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea8f81a26a9244e7e9f5d28c22b9bde4474828d

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

>R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)

But not all reviews have been positive:

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEFywyAMfE24xQMYg33g0Eu_wWCQHaYYXJDTcV9fkpwaDZIOrLTadRZhzeXUCBXJnisaPHfQCX5qBEQo5KhQTPCaeE0Vd2omoZqlAGw2RE32Y47BWQw5PVC9YlQyctNeqGkY-2WYlBTTOPGxH1yvrHec-cUNLzJ7-ADJgYY7lDMnIFHfEPd66T8u_LO9zZYvwAoJw9ZKV4-5onVfnctb-95bhj1fY07rtZ27kaA55ayFZJzRYep4J5kTamTCL0wIzmWH3zcc6S9cBN1W9m8nKfqdMob7A7k-BD8hTbNpfTtSwNNAsnMEr7EcQPDl5NMcs0KC0hz2xqJmsldUCikpk-qlvvklBGWCS0raDT63qfRO_wc8Qo7s), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

RIvean had its IPO and was listed last week, and now is trading at a market cap of $140 billion. They don’t have any sales, but Amazon owns around 20% of the stock, and put in an order for 100k electric trucks. They also plan to produce electric pickups, and Ford is in on the owners side ( to grab technology? ). The price is a bit more than doubled from the IPO price last week.

Lucid did an IPO earlier this year, and did Q3 yesterday. They have a market cap of $75 billion, and sits on all time high forming a double top. They just started deliveries, and have a production goal for 20k cars next year, and reservations for 17k. Saudi pension fun is in on the owner side. They had earnings yesterday and spiked on eps -0.46 against expected -0.23.

qv8fjw_BP,BP,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion.

The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

[ The shelved Rivian sports car ](https://preview.redd.it/w16x6b4mryz71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc93c80035549ec396c61770797fccf4d1bf4a87)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house. 

[ The breadth of Rivian’s capabilities \(S1 Filing\) ](https://preview.redd.it/mllbiwmnryz71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9640090a7fe55263c2122c2687fef9bd89633f2)

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

https://preview.redd.it/re7lokcpryz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea8f81a26a9244e7e9f5d28c22b9bde4474828d

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

>R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)

But not all reviews have been positive:

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEFywyAMfE24xQMYg33g0Eu_wWCQHaYYXJDTcV9fkpwaDZIOrLTadRZhzeXUCBXJnisaPHfQCX5qBEQo5KhQTPCaeE0Vd2omoZqlAGw2RE32Y47BWQw5PVC9YlQyctNeqGkY-2WYlBTTOPGxH1yvrHec-cUNLzJ7-ADJgYY7lDMnIFHfEPd66T8u_LO9zZYvwAoJw9ZKV4-5onVfnctb-95bhj1fY07rtZ27kaA55ayFZJzRYep4J5kTamTCL0wIzmWH3zcc6S9cBN1W9m8nKfqdMob7A7k-BD8hTbNpfTtSwNNAsnMEr7EcQPDl5NMcs0KC0hz2xqJmsldUCikpk-qlvvklBGWCS0raDT63qfRO_wc8Qo7s), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

qv8bn1_JNJ,JNJ,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house. 

[The breadth of Rivian’s capabilities \(S1 Filing\)](https://preview.redd.it/gfkweeveqyz71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc417353f583e7f2af48e4d3d65cced0d860eec)

 The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services. 

https://preview.redd.it/ein3o7hhqyz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5eb3436a206853965a301490eb5bf49992a067d

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

>R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)

But not all reviews have been positive:

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.

**Investors & Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology.

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

qtal6i_RIVN,RIVN,Rivian vs Tesla sanity check: back of the envelope calculation,"This will be short and sweet as I am down with covid now (Fatigue is a b\*\*\*c).

Let's assume that $TSLA is NOT one of the most overvalued mega cap ever as many argue and **I agree it is overvalued by a lot**. Not a huge TSLA fan here...

**But ....let's assume TSLA is fairly valued.**

Current market cap:

$TSLA: 1T

$RIVN: 127B

ratio of market cap: 7.8

I am not going to judge RIVN on current (near zero) revenue. Let's look at 2 years out and 9 years out.

A conservative forecast is that $TSLA can add [1.21M](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/09/tesla-growth-in-the-next-two-years-2022-2023/) vehicles to its yearly production. This is based on actual plants in/soon-to-be in production. Assuming 2021Q4 will grow at 15% over 2021Q3 (same growth from Q2 to Q3), TSLA would have produced 900M vehicles this year.

TSLA 2021: 900M

**TSLA 2023: 2.11M**

**TSLA 2030: Elon projects 20M**. This can be super optimistic, I will get back to it soon.

Demand for TSLA? TSLA does not have a demand issue as Elon. For example, currently TSLA is the second largest EV in \*CHINA\*.

&#x200B;

Let's Look at RIVIAN ($RIVN) production forecast according to its own CEO, however ambitious and optimistic:

RIVN 2023: [CEO projects 200K](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)

**RIVN 2030:** [**CEO projects at least 1M**](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)**.**

&#x200B;

1. **Car production:**
   1. Whether in 2023 or 2030, TSLA will produce at least 10X as RIVN. I say at least because TSLA can prove based on current plans capacity it can deliver 2.1M in 2023, RIVN CEO cannot really prove that, but let's take his work.
2. **Demand**
   1. Much hype has been made about RIVN because F and AMZN invested in it. And AMZN has committed to purchase 100K vehicles over the next 5 years. Let's put things into perspective: **TSLA has proved its popularity in CHINA, EUROPE, and US vs. RIVN has a contract with AMZN.**
   2. **Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN:** Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK?  IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares
3. **Other production**
   1. **Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium, + has proven it can navigate through shortages**
4. **Management:**
   1. I think we all agree - even TSLA haters - that Elon is one of the smartest most innovative, most ambitious visionary with a long track record of success after success. We know nothing about Scaringe. He is definitely a smart guy, but it would be extremely extremely optimistic to think he can one up Elon on innovation.

&#x200B;

**Finally we can talk about returns on your investment.**

RIVN remains largely pre-revenue, it has not proven itself yet. Therefore investors RIVN which is more risky play, needs to deliver higher returns than TSLA. **No one would invest in a pre-revenue company if its expected return on investment does not exceed  more mature companies.** Would you invest in TSLA if the returns on its stock is not going to exceed that of KO?

In 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only **= 20x.** Let's say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, **let's say it is 15X**

**Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.**

This means that even if TSLA's non-car production (solar, software, chips, etc) does not materialize and is equal to zero (against all evidence) ...

&#x200B;

**TLDR/CONCLUSION:**

At fair valuation in 2030 **with extremely generous assumption to RIVN** compared to TSLA **the returns on your RIVN investment will be HALF of that of TSLA**.. (1+x)=2\*(1+y)

**If the return on your TSLA stock is 100% ===> $RVN will be 0%**

**If the return on your TSLA stock is 50% ===> $RVN will be -25%**

**If the return on your TSLA stock is 0% ===> $RVN will be -50%**

IF TSLA crashes by 30% as some TSLA skeptics such as me believe it is possible, RIVN will have to crash by 65%

Again, this is under the assumption that TSLA (like RIVN) is only a car company and that RIVN will meet and exceed its goals in comparison to TSLA.

**Would you invest in a pre-revenue company with lower returns than a mature company?**

**Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. ($KNDI)**

Most recently, the company introduced its K32 luxury off-road vehicle. Johnny Tai, CEO of Kandi America, said that “Recognizing the growing enthusiasm for electric off-road recreational vehicles, Kandi is leveraging its automotive experience and EV technology to make a splash in the powersports industry.”

**Metromile Inc. ($MILE)**

More cars on the road, more insurance needed. New buyoug from LMND supposed to close by next year.

**KULR Technology Group Inc. ($KULR)**

Lithium battery handling. This month the company announced that it joined Clarios in the U.S. Department of Energy’s lithium-ion battery lifecycle initiative. The focus is on developing manufacturing and reuse of lithium-ion batteries and their chemical elements in the United States. According to KULR, it will provide the safe transportation of lithium-ion batteries within the entire battery management lifecycle.

**Platinum Group Metals ($PLG)**

Raw materials to make batteries. Also its Lion Battery Technologies Inc. initiative with Anglo American Platinum continues offering an opportunity to capitalize on lithium battery research and development. Platinum’s investment in Lion “creates a potential vertical integration with a broader industrial market development strategy.” Therefore, this is another aspect of PLG stock’s speculative momentum to take into account as well.",2021-11-10,21,11
