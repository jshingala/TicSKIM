LONG BEACH, Calif., May 27, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the parent holding company of Geost, LLC (""Geost""), a Tucson, Arizona-based electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) payload development and manufacturing company and provider to high-priority national security satellites, from Lightridge Solutions, a portfolio company of ATL Partners, for $275 million in a mix of $125 million of cash and $150 million in privately placed shares of Rocket Lab common stock, plus up to $50 million in potential additional cash earnout payments tied to revenue targets. The acquisition marks Rocket Lab’s formal entry into the satellite payload segment, strengthening the Company’s position as a provider of end-to-end national security space solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

With more than 20 years of flight heritage across classified and unclassified missions, Geost delivers advanced EO/IR sensor systems for missile warning and tracking, tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness—core capabilities for achieving the U.S. Department of Defense’s goals for resilient, proliferated space architectures, like the proposed Golden Dome architecture and the Space Development Agency’s Tracking Layer.

By bringing these mission critical payloads in-house, Rocket Lab enhances its ability to rapidly deliver integrated spacecraft systems purpose-built for U.S. national security, while reducing integration risk, reducing costs, and accelerating timelines. Geost’s full suite of sensing solutions enables warfighters and mission operators to protect, defend, and execute with speed and precision in increasingly contested space environments.

The acquisition adds Optical Systems as a new category within Rocket Lab’s deep portfolio of capabilities, cementing the Company’s role as a disruptor in national security space.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: ""Rocket Lab was founded to disrupt the traditional space industry and we’re doing just that by expanding our ability to deliver complete, mission-critical space solutions. With the acquisition of Geost, we’re bringing advanced electro-optical and infrared payloads in-house to support secure, responsive, and cost-effective systems at scale. These technologies enable spacecraft that can detect, interpret, and respond to threats in real time, enhancing our role as a trusted provider of end-to-end space capabilities for the United States and its allies—with greater speed, intelligence, and operational control.""

So two applications to the FCC for STAs were made by Rocket Lab for periods of operation from July 1st to December 31st 2025. They are attached above. 

One says it is for a suborbital electron mission, but doesn’t give a specific launch date or month. The GPS coordinates for its station land on the Electron launch pad. This must be a HASTE mission for the second half of the year.

The other application doesn’t specify the launch vehicle and says a confidential narrative is attached to specify the launch vehicle operations. It does give a launch date of September. If you type in the coordinates on the application for the station location they land on the Neutron pad. They are different from the coordinates of the Electron mission above. 

Could this application for a September launch be for Neutron?

1jrqzht_RKLB,RKLB,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,"Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn’t waiting around: they’ve signed new launch deals (e.g. an 8-launch contract with Japan’s iQPS just announced) , and they delivered on missions like launching 8 satellites for OroraTech with just 4 months’ turnaround , showcasing operational excellence.
* Government and Commercial Tailwinds: Unlike many space SPACs and startups that struggled, Rocket Lab has real customers and repeat business. Their backlog is \~$1.1B , split \~50/50 between government and commercial clients – providing diversification. Notably, Rocket Lab was selected for the U.S. Space Force’s NSSL Phase 3 (Lane 1) program , making them eligible for missions under a $5.6B launch contract umbrella alongside incumbents like SpaceX and ULA. They also hold a $515M contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to build missile-tracking satellite systems . These wins not only validate Rocket Lab’s technology in the eyes of key customers, but also ensure a baseline of revenue in coming years. In essence, Rocket Lab is aligning itself as a core player in future government space infrastructure – a recurring revenue stream that many “new space” companies lack.
* Musk Factor – or Lack Thereof: From an investing standpoint, one could argue that Musk has become a risk factor. Tesla’s own 10-K warned that the brand is tied to Musk’s reputation , and indeed we’ve seen political backlash contribute to Tesla’s sales slump and stock drop . SpaceX, while successful, is privately funded and also influenced by Musk’s persona (which might carry regulatory or public image risks, given his role in government and polarizing public statements). Rocket Lab provides a “Musk-free” exposure to the space sector. CEO Peter Beck is an engineer-executive who keeps a lower profile. There’s no cult of personality driving Rocket Lab’s valuation – which means less idiosyncratic risk. In fact, Rocket Lab’s shares are more directly correlated with its execution (launch success, contracts, revenue) than with any social media narrative. For an investor, that can be reassuring.

Valuation Considerations: After the recent pullback, RKLB trades at a more reasonable multiple relative to its growth. It had skyrocketed over 400% in the past year , but is now off highs. Analysts still see upside: Cantor Fitzgerald recently reaffirmed an Overweight with a $24 target , and other targets range up to $33 . Clearly, expectations are that Rocket Lab will continue to scale and eventually approach profitability as Neutron comes into service. Risks include execution delays (a short-seller argued Neutron could be late to 2026 , which would slow revenue growth) and competition (SpaceX’s dominance, emerging players like Blue Origin). However, Rocket Lab’s head start in small launch and established customer base give it a moat in its niche. Its enterprise value ($11B) is a fraction of SpaceX’s ($140B private valuation), so investors are essentially betting that Rocket Lab can capture even a small slice of SpaceX’s market share in the coming years – which would justify significant upside.

Conclusion: If you’re disillusioned with Musk or simply want a piece of the space sector’s growth, Rocket Lab is one of the most compelling options available. It combines the innovation of New Space with the accountability of a public company. As always, invest based on your due diligence (space is a risky industry), but RKLB offers a balanced risk-reward profile: solid current business, big future bets, and freedom from the Elon factor. For many, that’s an attractive proposition in 2025 and beyond.

1jrqwdb_RKLB,RKLB,Rocket Lab vs SpaceX: The Anti‑Musk Space Investment Campaign,"RKLB: The Musk‑Free Space Stock Ready to Soar 🚀

Elon Musk’s antics and political ties are starting to spook investors – from protests at Tesla showrooms to falling sales . Enter Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB), a pure-play space company with no Musk baggage and strong fundamentals. Rocket Lab just posted record revenue of $436 million in 2024 (up 78% YoY) , yet the stock has pulled back after a recent dip, creating an opportunity. Here’s why RKLB could be a stellar long-term pick:

* Beating Expectations, Despite the Dip: Q4 2024 revenue jumped 121% year-over-year . But cautious Q1 guidance (\~$120M vs $135M expected) spooked the market, and RKLB stock fell \~11% on that news – now down \~30% in the past month . This pullback looks technical, not fundamental, as the company is still growing fast.
* Strong Backlog & Partnerships: Rocket Lab’s order backlog hit $1.1 billion by end-2024 , nearly half from government contracts. They build satellites for NASA/DoD and just won a role in the U.S. Space Force’s NSSL program (a launch contract pool worth up to $5.6B) . In short, reliable revenue streams backed by government and commercial clients.
* Upcoming Catalyst – Neutron Rocket: In 2025, Rocket Lab plans to debut Neutron, a medium-lift, partially reusable rocket aimed at competing with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 . Management confirms it’s on track for H2 2025 launch . Success could unlock larger payload missions and massive new contracts. (Some skeptics think it slips to 2026 , but even a slight delay doesn’t derail the vision.)
* Elon Who? Unlike SpaceX, Rocket Lab is publicly traded and not tied to Musk’s volatility. Musk’s close alliance with politicians and controversial behavior are now seen as business risks . By contrast, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck stays out of politics and focuses on execution. That makes RKLB a cleaner investment narrative if you’re wary of “key-man risk.”

Bottom line: Rocket Lab offers high growth (launch and satellite services) without the Musk drama. Analysts are bullish too (price targets range \~$24–33 , well above the current price). With the stock trading off its highs and Elon’s shine wearing off, RKLB could be ready for liftoff in portfolios looking for the next space success story. Do your DD, but this under-the-radar rocket company might just shoot for the moon.

1j0a5pn_RKLB,RKLB,Rocket Lab's Stock Fell 25% This Week. Here's Why It's a Buying Opportunity.,"**Rocket Lab** (Nasdaq: RKLB) has gotten a lot of attention in recent years as ""the disruptor of the space economy."" 

First a bit of background. 

Its *Electron* rocket is already launching smaller satellites of up to 300 kgs into orbit, but it's also developing a much larger *Neutron* rocket that will carry entire satellite constellation payloads that weigh up to 10,000 kgs.

Most compare the company to SpaceX, though this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. SpaceX is primarily launching its own satellites for Starlink satellite internet, and it's offering rideshare to anyone who wants to hop on for a ride. Rocket Lab is offering much smaller, dedicated launches for commercial customers and for government defense programs. But it's building a bigger rocket now, which might compete in some cases with SpaceX's Falcon.

So back to what's going on with the stock.

Rocket Lab caught some heat earlier this week after getting blasted by a short report from Bleecker Street Research. Short reports are often short-term financially-motivated, and this conveniently came out two days before Q4 earnings (which during the quiet period, where Rocket Lab couldn't respond).

The crux of the short report is that Neutron's development is taking longer than expected and that its unit economics might not be as advertised. BSR believes the combination of Neutron's debut launch being delayed and it capturing less revenue in its earliest launches will lead to a cash crunch.

BSR went on to disclose that they are short Rocket Lab, but they did not issue a price target of what they believe the stock is worth. [Here is a link to their full report](https://www.bleeckerstreetresearch.com/research/rklb) for anyone who might be interested.

And now, why this is a buying opportunity.

I personally am on my seventh iteration of a Rocket Lab discounted cash flow valuation model and **I am sticking to $23 per share as an objective fair value for Rocket Lab's stock.**

Rocket Lab admitted during Thursday's earnings that its Neutron debut is expected ""in the second half of 2025."" 

That's fine with me, as I'd rather see them get this perfect for the first launch rather than rushing things to hit the deadline. I even expect they'll discount the price of the first Neutron launch to be closer to $30 million (rather than $50 million as is generally expected).

The six or twelve month delay is negligible to the stock price. We're already know that Neutron will take time to ramp up and we aren't expecting more than a handful of launches during the first few years anyway. In a worst-case scenario, pushing the first Neutron launch out to late 2026 or even 2027 wouldn't result in more than a $4 per share impact to Rocket Lab's current price target (i.e. around $19 per share instead of $23).

[Here's a link to see all of my Rocket Lab research](https://7investing.com/company_name/rocket-lab/) and all of the assumptions I've used in my DCF.

Outside of potential Neutron delays, everything else numbers-wise pretty much aligned with my previous expectations. 

There are fewer Electron launches set-in-stone on the launch schedule for 2025, but there are also more of them purposely-unscheduled and reserved for the US Space Force's responsive program (which is higher revenue per launch but also demands a launch within 24 hours). Electron's revenue per launch on Electron in 2025 will also be \~3% higher than it was in 2024.

Within Space Systems (where Rocket Lab manufactures the satellites and components), backlog is ""lumpy"" but is still progressing nicely. New or updated contracts have been signed with the Space Defense Agency and Victus Haze, while the reveal of a new ""Flatellite"" design could be a perfect fit for upcoming constellations launched by Neutron.

I'd encourage anyone investing in Rocket Lab to look at what this company is accomplishing over long periods of time. Rather than putting any of their quarterly results under the microscope.   
  
**The punchline = I believe this week's selloff is likely a buying opportunity for longer-term investors.**

*Disclosure: I personally own RKLB stock and have held an active position since 2021.*

After hitting a quintuple bottom at $3.47 in April 2024, it broke out of a three year bear-market and rallied 690% to $27.44 last Friday, at 12.3 billion market cap. While the rocketing stock price seems too hot to touch, the stock is just getting started.

* Electron rocket has solidified its reputation in the industry. There are only three companies capable of reusable rockets: SpaceX, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin.
* Neutron is going to be the true challenger to Falcon 9, this year's maiden launch is major catalyst for the stock.
* RKLB is vertically integrated space company, capable of satellite manufacturing, rocket launch, and space system support (rocket launch contributes only 30% of the company revenue).

# Electron Rocket

The small **reusable** rocket carved a niche market out of Falcon 9. Electron cost 7.5 million (now raised to 8.5 million) per launch with 300 kg payload. Falcon 9 cost $70 million with 23 tons payload. While the cost-per-kilo is obviously worse for Electron, it is a commonly misunderstood metric. You don't buy a fraction of the rocket by multiply cost-per-kilo with your payload weight. You either buy the whole rocket, or ride-share with other passengers. Electron is like UberX, you book it at anytime, go anywhere, depart anytime, and reschedule as you wish. Falcon9 is like carpool. You wait for all the passengers to get onboard, and only leave at a time when it works for everyone.

Electron has [16 launches in 2024](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/missions-launched/) with 100% success rate. Notably it launched two missions within 24 hours on Nov 24 and 25, on its **two private-owned spaceports** in New Zealand and USA. Booking an Electron rocket is easy as booking UberX for space.

[100&#37; success rate in 2024](https://preview.redd.it/a5tu81w04aie1.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd10344389bda651c69eaf96a9849d166c76059)

# Neutron Rocket

Everyone knows about Electron at this point. If RKLB were just about Electron, it would be overvalued now. But few people understand the Neutron yet. This is a medium-lift rocket comparable to Falcon 9. When it was first announced, it was scoffed at for its dull resemblance to Falcon 9. Then something amazing happened. Neutron design morphed into a **BBC rocket – a chubby, black, sexy dildo shape**. While its competitors are still trying to clone Falcon 9, Neutron has been redesigned from first principles, and ready to shock the space industry.

>It's a rocket from 2050. – Rocket Lab CEO, Peter Beck

[The \\""unexciting\\"" Falcon 9 clone](https://preview.redd.it/ys7qsv4ky9ie1.png?width=3070&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c3e00d7f7516140655f36f57d8d1ca52378cec6)

[Neutron design: before vs after](https://preview.redd.it/udf1ig5xu9ie1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7820434a993364e5029010fbd5d1b62d7970635c)

***Second Stage Rocket Redesign***

Unlike its competitors which stack second stage rocket on top of the first stage. The second stage rocket is placed inside the first stage. The tip of the rocket (fairing) opens up like a hippo mouth to spit out the second stage rocket. It comes with 3 advantages:

* The second stage is protected from aerodynamic forces. So the second stage doesn't have to be aerodynamic. It can be any shape you like.
* The second stage is protected by the fairings, which are permanently attached to the rocket Unlike Falcon 9 which discards the fairings, Neutron designed its fairing to be an integral part of the rocket for rapid reuse.
* Because other rockets place the second stage on top of first stage. The second stage is subject to compression force as the rocket goes up. Neutron ""hangs"" the second stage inside, pulling the second stage upward. What difference does this make: Neutron carbon fiber is much stronger under tension than compression. This makes the second stage much simpler and more fuel-efficient. Rocket Lab is the carbon fiber alchemist. They can 3D-print carbon fiber faster than Fed can print QE.

I took the summary from the video [Who wins the reusability race](https://youtu.be/Ynebk_71sxM?si=oIw-miQnUnPleC_I&t=480). It's an in-depth video that every RKLB investor should watch.

[Neutron \\""Hungry Hippo\\"" fairing opening and releasing stage 2](https://preview.redd.it/mpgk5myz3bie1.jpg?width=1120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe7d655fa9bb61ad031a5992ed7ff141dac5a179)

**iPhone Moment**  
When Neutron hits the market, it will be the iPhone moment of Space. We have seen enough homogenous looking rockets stacking one stage on another, with more and more fuels. Neutron achieves better reusability (fairing) and fuel efficiency through radical redesign. It is built from first principle, ignoring what everyone else has been doing.

The radical redesign is like Apples ""think different."" This is not the only trait that reminds me of Apple. RKLB's obsession with vertical integration reminds me of how Apple obsesses with user experience from hardware to software. The clean, minimalistic design of the Electron rocket and the launch pad stands in stark contrast to other rockets which must launch with wired ""ICU"" life-support tower. Neutron takes one step further. It is designed to launch and land on its own, without any fancy structure on the ground.

[Clean & crisp Electron launch](https://preview.redd.it/jynjk528aaie1.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5076fdba6aeec0a6d4e947def84950787b98762)

**Engineering Excellence**

The market has not priced in Neutron success. It's first flight was supposed to happen in 2024 but delayed to 2025. Delay sucks but it's not uncommon in space. But it also means catalyst is still ahead of us.

Elon Musk intentionally kept SpaceX private in order to shield it from public pressure. SpaceX can blow up rockets and burned R&D cash with abandon. Rocket Lab does not have such luxury. It is under immense pressure to deliver. Their engineering track record is stellar. Rocket Lab's Electron cost 100M R&D to get to orbit and plan to spend just 300M on Neutron. Falcon rockets cost \~2.5B in R&D (excluding Falcon heavy).

Will Neutron succeed on its first try? I don't think the stock has priced it in. Even Falcon 9 had two in-flight failures and one pre-flight failure. Few people are expecting Neutron to succeed on first try. But the possibility is not zero. Electron rocket almost entered orbit on its first launch. It was aborted due to a communication glitch on the ground, causing the operator to destroy the rocket. If their engineers keep on pushing, they might deliver the biggest surprise to rocket history.

# Other DD

**Survival of the fittest:** The three year bear market hit space industry hard. The weak competitors have been shaken out. Virgin Galactic and Momentus stock prices are in the toilet. Virgin Orbit has gone bankrupt. Astra Space has been taken private after 99% stock crash. The survivors of the bear markets are the fittest.

**Peter Beck**: a humble genius workaholic. He has no college degree, got massive balls, strapped rocket engines to his bike and went full YOLO, applied to NASA, hated its bureaucracy, then quit to start his own rocket company. He was talking about how to build rocket at age 32. He's still talking about it today. He's dedicated to one thing his entire life. And at age 49, he's still full of LIFE.

[Peter Beck demonstrating the art of YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/dfol6j53odie1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d08c28ffb6953d3f5c60c8a6a5e1a719192dfecc)

**Political tailwind:** With Orange man in the House, Elon Musk as space cheerleader, and Nasa new chief Jared Isaacman who likes Rocket Lab, we are entering a very favorable 4-year term for the space industry.

**About SpaceX**: SpaceX is unquestionably the king of space. I can only say, space is BIG. It's more than enough for one company to thrive. The political detachment of RKLB is an advantage over SpaceX, as Elon's enemies are going to SpaceX a hard time sooner or later..

**Cathie Wood** sold 70,252 shares of RKLB in ARKQ and ARKX fund. What can I say? 🚀

**Jim Cramer** does NOT recommend buying. On Nov 24 last year: ""'It's Not A Bad Company By Any Means, But It Is Up 305%'."". The stock was $24 back then. It went up 38% to hit all time high $33.34 on Jan 24, and has corrected nearly 20% since then. 🚀

**Investor community:** r/RKLB dip buyers are in no rush to cash out. Most of them are long term HOLDers. They are really nice people and they hate wsb fomo. They don't want RKLB to be a meme stock, but who can stop the rocket when it decides to go up? 🚀

**Technical analysis**: I have never seen a stock battling major resistance so many time so hard. Since January, RKLB has challenged and rejected by $30 eight times, each time with higher lows. A weak-ass stock doesn't challenge major resistance so rigorously. While it has been frustrating for bulls, the stronger the resistance, the stronger the support it becomes after break out.

# Price Target

With SpaceX valued at 350 billion in **private market**, Rocket Lab 12.3 billion market cap is chump change. I expect Rocket Lab to deliver Neutron, and continue its track record of engineering excellence. **A conservative 1/10 valuation of SpaceX would place RKLB at 35 billion, or $78 per share.** But I expect the share price to go much higher than that after Neutron hit the market and everyone realizes what a genius 🚀 it is.

Bears can bash me with their price-to-sales ratio and other financial metrics. That's not how you price new technology, trend, and sentiment 🚀🚀🚀. Just because it's up 700% from rock bottom doesn't mean it's too late. Good stocks go up and they keep going up. Get used to averaging up.

A weak-ass stock doesn't challenge major resistance so rigorously. While it has been frustrating for bulls, the stronger the resistance, the stronger the support it becomes after break out.

# Price Target

With SpaceX valued at 350 billion in **private market**, Rocket Lab 12.3 billion market cap is chump change. I expect Rocket Lab to deliver Neutron, and continue its track record of engineering excellence. **A conservative 1/10 valuation of SpaceX would place RKLB at 35 billion, or $78 per share.** But I expect the share price to go much higher than that after Neutron hit the market and everyone realizes what a genius 🚀 it is.

Bears can bash me with their price-to-sales ratio and other financial metrics. That's not how you price new technology, trend, and sentiment 🚀🚀🚀. Just because it's up 700% from rock bottom doesn't mean it's too late. Good stocks go up and they keep going up. Get used to averaging up.

1i8x7y7_MAR,MAR,$RKLB — Your Thoughts?,"Hi all, 

Curious as to others’ thoughts on the current price action of $RKLB, currently setting new ATH’s as we speak. 

My investment in them currently sits at a 600% gain, and I feel conflicted about current valuation/way forward.

Common sense tells me to sell my shares cuz I have a 600% gain in a relatively short time and it’s kinda silly not to.  The current rise seems a bit irrational based on current valuation (revenues/profits). 

The current market cap doesn’t make sense if looking at the metrics — revenues aren’t super high and they aren’t even quite profitable yet. 

My only guess for the sharp rise in share price is that the market has decided to price the company relative to SpaceX’s rumoured valuation.  There were rumours SpaceX would look to go public at some point, and privately it is valued now around 150-200B.  

If that valuation is taken seriously, I could see why the market would consider RKLB to be worth at least half as much?  

And then, with the recent change in leadership in the USA and the emphasis on space initiatives, I see only promise for RKLB. 

So, what are your thoughts on what is driving the price appreciation in RKLB lately?  What is your outlook going forward?  Would you sell if you were me?  Or hold or even average up?  ",2025-01-24,103,125

**Here's Why I like ARKG next:**

Thanks to the hate towards Cathie Woods right now and her entire list of funds, $ARKG has be absolutely decimated and short into oblivions. In fact, the fund has a 30% short position against it directly, which for an ETF is absolutely bonkers. Now I am not bullish on most of Cathies wild claims, however facts are facts. The call options are not pricing in the potentially huge move this ETF can make.

I don't want this post to get political, I started a discussion on this topic a few days ago and it got banned by mods (my bad for that, wasn't intentional). Yet government funding whether right or wrong can help specific sectors and companies. I truthfully believe that this government (Love or hate them) is going to pump cure related companies.

I don't want to go into too much detail as I wish to stay fully within WSB rules, yet every single person of power including trump, mush, vance and JFK Junior has preached they want the American healthcare to focus on Cure based research.

You can watch the Joe Rogan with Vance here > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s)

ARKG is absolutely full of said names, and whether the elections are right or wrong (This is not an election post nor political) it's extremely likely that substantial sums of money flows to these names.

Yet that's just the starter, when names like NTLA, BEAM etc ran up post covid in 2021 they were nothing more than cash burning Biotechs with fancy titles and ridiculously ambitious goals. To cure diseases at their route cause and potentially cure an array of heredity diseases at birth.

Today we are starting to witness these wild claims become a reality, as most have failed a few winners in the Space have survived, such as CRSP with FDA approval in the USA, UK and Europe for its Sickle Cell disease cure. NTLA is not far away from potentially have a cure worth $20bn whilst its enterprise value sits at a mere $600.

Skip to the 7th Minute where this is discussed In detail: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE)

Then you have names like RXRX which already have a cult following and a pipeline in Oncology worth potentially 10x the Current value of the company. Backed by NVDA and with the largest super computer in the biotech industry worldwide, the CEO even has 90% of his net worth inside the company.

I have gone over all the holdings and checked the financial situation of each company, how much cash runway they have etc and so forth. When I take that into account, along with the rate cuts, the fact that most of the weighted names have huge potential and pipelines, large piles of cash and catalysts pending, this feels like a great arbitrage play.

Biotech has done a whole lot of nothing in 5 years, ever since the first rate hike, even though AI continues to show signs of benefiting the industry. Cathie Wood has become one of the most hated and mocked fund managers of our time. Almost every name has a medium to high short float and the sector isn’t being priced as though a big move is coming, yet the individual holdings do.

Below are just a few of the big catalysts being released into year end:

1. NTLA ATTR huge data update 
2. BEAM 101 data at ASH 
3. CRSP CTX-112 CAR-T data 
4. NTLA 2002 Phase 2 Data 
5. BEAM 201 Data at ASH 
6. BEAM NHP ESCAPE Data at ASH 
7. SANA Data Update 

The big one is this Saturday with NTLA, if the data is good it will likely push the whole sector into a bullish uptrend, as that cure alone is worth more than almost the entire sector.

If you don't understand Genomics take some time over the next few days and this weekend to grasp just how much value creation is at stake here. This is the kind of thing we dreamed about 20 Years ago, and it's finally starting to take place.

Everybody is betting against this whole sector turning into a Zero, just as many names begin to not only fulfil their ideas but actually turn a revenue, and significant revenues at that.

So I'm long Jan calls and just looking what further dated options to pick up.

These are the top 10 weighted names In the ETF TWST, CRSP, RXRX, ADPT, CDNA, TEM, VCYT, IONS, NTLA, BEAM Incase you want to look them up individually.

**Here's Why I like ARKG next:**

Thanks to the hate towards Cathie Woods right now and her entire list of funds, $ARKG has be absolutely decimated and short into oblivions. In fact, the fund has a 30% short position against it directly, which for an ETF is absolutely bonkers. Now I am not bullish on most of Cathies wild claims, however facts are facts. The call options are not pricing in the potentially huge move this ETF can make.

I don't want this post to get political, I started a discussion on this topic a few days ago and it got banned by mods (my bad for that, wasn't intentional). Yet government funding whether right or wrong can help specific sectors and companies. I truthfully believe that this government (Love or hate them) is going to pump cure related companies.

I don't want to go into too much detail as I wish to stay fully within WSB rules, yet every single person of power including trump, mush, vance and JFK Junior has preached they want the American healthcare to focus on Cure based research.

You can watch the Joe Rogan with Vance here > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s)

ARKG is absolutely full of said names, and whether the elections are right or wrong (This is not an election post nor political) it's extremely likely that substantial sums of money flows to these names.

Yet that's just the starter, when names like NTLA, BEAM etc ran up post covid in 2021 they were nothing more than cash burning Biotechs with fancy titles and ridiculously ambitious goals. To cure diseases at their route cause and potentially cure an array of heredity diseases at birth.

Today we are starting to witness these wild claims become a reality, as most have failed a few winners in the Space have survived, such as CRSP with FDA approval in the USA, UK and Europe for its Sickle Cell disease cure. NTLA is not far away from potentially have a cure worth $20bn whilst its enterprise value sits at a mere $600.

Skip to the 7th Minute where this is discussed In detail: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE)

Then you have names like RXRX which already have a cult following and a pipeline in Oncology worth potentially 10x the Current value of the company. Backed by NVDA and with the largest super computer in the biotech industry worldwide, the CEO even has 90% of his net worth inside the company.

I have gone over all the holdings and checked the financial situation of each company, how much cash runway they have etc and so forth. When I take that into account, along with the rate cuts, the fact that most of the weighted names have huge potential and pipelines, large piles of cash and catalysts pending, this feels like a great arbitrage play.

Biotech has done a whole lot of nothing in 5 years, ever since the first rate hike, even though AI continues to show signs of benefiting the industry. Cathie Wood has become one of the most hated and mocked fund managers of our time. Almost every name has a medium to high short float and the sector isn’t being priced as though a big move is coming, yet the individual holdings do.

Below are just a few of the big catalysts being released into year end:

1. NTLA ATTR huge data update 
2. BEAM 101 data at ASH 
3. CRSP CTX-112 CAR-T data 
4. NTLA 2002 Phase 2 Data 
5. BEAM 201 Data at ASH 
6. BEAM NHP ESCAPE Data at ASH 
7. SANA Data Update 

The big one is this Saturday with NTLA, if the data is good it will likely push the whole sector into a bullish uptrend, as that cure alone is worth more than almost the entire sector.

If you don't understand Genomics take some time over the next few days and this weekend to grasp just how much value creation is at stake here. This is the kind of thing we dreamed about 20 Years ago, and it's finally starting to take place.

Everybody is betting against this whole sector turning into a Zero, just as many names begin to not only fulfil their ideas but actually turn a revenue, and significant revenues at that.

So I'm long Jan calls and just looking what further dated options to pick up.

These are the top 10 weighted names In the ETF TWST, CRSP, RXRX, ADPT, CDNA, TEM, VCYT, IONS, NTLA, BEAM Incase you want to look them up individually.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “In the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our end-to-end space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch, as well as space systems. Revenue grew 55% year-on-year to $105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at $1.05 billion. Significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer; successfully launching twelve Electron launches year-to-date, making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come; signing $55 million in new Electron launches, further cementing Electron’s position as a global launch leader; and being selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth as part of a world-first mission. We expect to close out the year strongly with more Electron launches scheduled in November and December, alongside continued progress across Neutron and space systems, that is behind our guidance for a record $125-$135 million revenue quarter in Q4.”

**Business Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024, plus updates since September 30, 2024.**

**Electron:**

* Achieved a new annual launch record of 12 Electron launches to date, with more scheduled across November and December 2024. Electron is the world’s third most-frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type and remains the United States’ second most-frequently launched rocket annually.
* Signed several new Electron launch contracts in Q3 2024 with a total value of $55m, demonstrating an increased average selling price of $8.4m and showcasing a 67% pricing increase since the rocket’s debut launch.
* Successful Electron launches for three separate commercial satellite constellation operators in Q3, including two missions launched within just eight days. In addition to these, Electron’s most recent mission, launched in the fourth quarter on November 5 ^(th) , 2024, included an expedited turnaround of just 10 weeks between contract signing and launch.

**Neutron:**

* Signed a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation operator that signifies the beginning of a productive collaboration that could see Neutron deploy the entire constellation.
* Announced a federal defense contract that supports Neutron and the development of its Archimedes engine with the U.S. Air Force’s Research Laboratory.
* Doubled engine testing cadence for Archimedes over the quarter at Rocket Lab’s engine test site in Mississippi, alongside strong production execution at the Company’s Engine Development Complex in California which included multiple engines manufactured, assembled, and shipped for engine testing.
* Significant progress made across Neutron’s structures and infrastructure, including the completion of construction on the rocket’s Assembly, Integration, and Test (A.I.T.) facility in Virginia.
* Well-positioned to on-ramp to the U.S. Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Lane 1 program, which began accepting proposals in November 2024 to on-ramp new launch providers to an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract valued at $5.6 billion over a five-year period.

**Space Systems:**

* Completed production and delivery of two spacecraft on time and on budget for NASA’s ESCAPADE mission to Mars.
* Selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth, a first-of-its-kind mission.
* Completed two new spacecraft for Varda Space Industries to conduct the 2 ^(nd) and 3 ^(rd) missions to return in-space manufacturing capsules to Earth.
* Executed on schedule against the Company’s $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency to build 18 spacecraft for its Tranche 2 Transport Layer program.",2024-11-12,346,101

1fqujhq_MAR,MAR,RKLB - a DD for Simple Jacks,"RKLB is complicated. It’s a rocket and rocket systems end to end company.

I’ve seen many confuse it with RKT- a mortgage company, that is how regarded people are.

If you read my DD on HIMS it was much more complicated.  If you traded on that, congrats you are up 18% in less than a month.

I’ve done similar research on RKLB and taken a $12k position in calls expiring January.

Here’s the quick DD:

They make rockets, and successfully launch satellites into orbit for small and medium size satellites.

Spacex has a sort of monopoly on launching the larger satellites with larger rocket, Falcon 9.

RKLB, is making a rocket to compete with falcon 9 and will be done in a year or so.

Spacex has a $200B or so evaluation.

RKLB has a $4B evaluation.

200/4=50 

50x gain opportunity.  And that’s just shares.

With options napkin math you can 5-10x ur gains if you pick the right contracts.

So there’s a 250x return here just waiting to be taken.

Risks people keep saying that aren’t true:  “they will go bankrupt their cash burn is crazy!”  

They are actually profitable if you don’t include what they are spending for the next year or 1.5 years to finish their falcon 9 competitor rocket, which is the whole point of the thesis.

They have executed flawlessly on building many rockets so far that are putting satellites into space.

There is a more complicated platform play here for the true artists.

But personally I like to keep it simple:

250-500x return on long calls, 50x return on shares.

Buy buy buy 

Except this isn’t financial advice,
It’s a fucking rocket company

* **OST-tADC:** Another promising platform, this tunable Antibody Drug Conjugate (tADC) uses proprietary silicone linker technology for precise treatment options across a broader range of solid tumors.

**Revenue Potential:** The company is poised to generate significant revenue through out-licensing deals and a priority review voucher, with potential income streams ranging from $15M to $110M.

**Future Outlook:** OS Therapies is on the brink of major clinical milestones, positioning itself as a significant player in the fight against solid tumors, especially for younger populations in need of new and effective treatments.

Great vertically integrated space company run by competent management.

No matter where the commercial space industry goes, RKLB is gonna have a piece. Whether that's satellite building, space solar panels, space related software, etc... RKLB is planning on doing it all.

Launch is a low margin business that doesn't make any money and no-one wants to compete on launch. What is important is what being a big launch provider enables. And that is to be primed to grab whatever piece of the space economy pie that shows itself. Essentially, if something like space mining is shown to be viable, then whoever has launch capabilities can immediately pivot to that. You can already see the transition as the space systems (non-launch stuff like satellites) part of rocket lab is printing money and is quickly going to overtake launch as the primary revenue generator at RKLB. IMO, it's gonna be RKLB and SpaceX in the end and everyone else is just going to be fighting for scraps.

1do46x3_O,O,Skyrocketing Returns: Invest in RKLB and the Future of Space Launches!,"**Have you heard about Rocket Lab USA?**

Aerospace and space launch service-provider: Rocket Lab USA is Elon Musk’s famous SpaceX, biggest competitor. What if I told you that a company that was founded in 2006 in New Zealand and headquartered in California only in 2013 is currently outpacing SpaceX’s growth?

You heard me right. This year, so far, Rocket Lab has launched a total of 9 payloads vs a total of 9 launches during 2023. If they maintain the pace throughout 2024, we might get a total of 18 launches or more, which equates an outstanding growth in # of launches of more than 100%. On the other hand SpaceX has launched a total of 60 times so far vs a total of 96 launches in 2023 ([SpaceX closes out record-breaking 2023, prepares for more records in 2024 - NASASpaceFlight.com](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2023/12/falcon-roundup/)). Keeping the same pace would mean SpaceX will launch about 120 payloads in 2024, which accounts for a growth rate of about 25% only.

Most analysts value SpaceX at over 180 Billion $. Note that, so far in 2024, it has launched close to seven times more payloads than its competitor Rocket Lab USA. Note, however, that Rocket Lab’s market value sits close to 2 Billion $, which would mean that SpaceX is valued around 100 times more than Rocket Lab USA currently is.

I’m sure I have raised your eyebrows already. Please be patient and bear with me for a minute, while I go through Rocket Lab’s fundamentals and explain my thesis on the following chapters.



**So, where is the money?**



Rocket Lab USA adds value to two main costumer segments:

B2B (Business to Business):

   * Private companies, particularly those in telecommunications, Earth observation, and technology demonstration sectors are looking for affordable access to space for launching and operating their small satellites.

   * Universities and research organizations utilize Rocket Lab’s services to deploy scientific instruments and experimental payloads, facilitating advancements in space science and technology.



B2G (Business to Government):

   * Rocket Lab serves various government and defense customers, including NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other international space agencies. These missions often involve scientific research, reconnaissance, and national security payloads.

They serve the above customers by monetizing the below added-value services:

1. **Electron Rocket Launches**:

   * **Small Satellite Launches**: The Electron rocket, designed to carry small payloads. It provides cost-efficient launches. See hereunder the KPIs for Rocket Lab’s flagship product:



[Electron KPIs \(Rocket Lab USA Website\)](https://preview.redd.it/xrbp8sorhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ff74c7e22a12acdf9f48d47fe1a3f7ce3d21ff)

2. **Neutron Rocket Launches** 

   * Neutron is being developed to carry larger payloads, targeting the medium-lift market.



**Which wave are we surfing here?**

A new report ([Space economy | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://www.weforum.org/publications/space-the-1-8-trillion-opportunity-for-global-economic-growth/)) by WEF states that space will be a 1.8$ Trillion opportunity by 2035. Currently space industry represents about 400 $ Billion In total valuation. That would be more than a 4X in the total valuation of the industry in only 11 years. Space launch services are one of the most important verticals within space industry.



**Who is well positioned to surf this wave?**

Even though there were a lot of small companies that partook on the “gold rush” that space launch industry is, there are not many players that stood the test of time and are still operating (note that we have only selected companies that either have launched payloads since the beginning of 2024 until now, or are planning to launch in the next few months):



[Number of Space Launches 2024 \(Spreadsheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/ljbv6n5thp8d1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e61085ea537293aae7d4865bc77bc360791f90)



**1. SpaceX (privately held company)**

* **Products offered**: Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

Since 2010 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy has launched more than 350 times, with a stellar record of only 2 failures, which represents a failure rate of less than 1%. SpaceX is by far the company that has the biggest share of space launch market.

This year SpaceX has launched a total of 60 payloads. Most of those payloads are StarLink satellites, but that makes it the US company that has been most active so far.



**2. Rocket lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB)**

* **Products offered**: Discussed in previous sections.

Rocket lab has launched a total of 9 payloads since the beginning of the year. This makes it the second most active player in the market thus far.

**Does Rocket Lab USA have a moat?**



We all know that aerospace and space launch industry has huge entry barriers, as it is very capital-intensive and costly as a starting investment.

It is also not easy to be granted the permits to provide launching services in the USA.

A moat is a ditch that used to be dug around castles and fortifications. The whole idea behind it was to make it more difficult for enemies to invade. This term was popularized in the investment world by Warren Buffet, defending that companies should also have their own moats, to prevent market share being lost to new or existent competitors.

The biggest moats Rocket lab has are their proprietary technologies (uniquely distinguishable from their competitors) and the processes they have designed to ensure efficient launches, you might find some further details about both hereunder:

**Electron Rocket technologies and unique processes:**

   * Electron Rocket Engine - Rutherford is Rocket Lab’s proprietary engine, which has the following unique characteristics:

      * 3D Printed: Most of its components are 3D printed, which allows for a faster production and reduced manufacturing costs;
      * Battery-powered Pumps: Pumps are powered by lithium batteries, which effectively makes Rutherford the first battery-powered rocket engine;

   * Launching phases:

      * First Stage: The Electron’s first stage uses nine Rutherford engines, providing the thrust required to escape Earth's gravity.
      * Second Stage: A single Rutherford engine carries the payload into orbit.
      * Kick Stage: This optional stage provides precise orbital insertion for small satellites, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of the mission.

   * Reusability: First stage of Electron rocket is reusable. Rockets are refurbished after they have completed their mission.

* **Research and Development (Neutron Rocket):** Rocket lab USA is currently investing hard in its proprietary Neutron Rocket, which is planned to launch for the first time in 2025. Hereunder some details that have already been shared about this rocket:

[Neutron Rocket overview \(Rocket Lab USA Website\)](https://preview.redd.it/w0plzdlyhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4963a743cbad2f54fc190ed32e54ff476b1f95d8)

[Neutron Rocket Features \(Rocket Lab USA Website\)](https://preview.redd.it/1donmohzhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6cfd7d0186b277804a4bb46dd89b3a83c43f4aa)





**Financial Performance**

Rocket Lab USA is still not profitable. I’d rather investigate its financial health and determine how solid their books are and if they will be able, or not, to reach their goals and become profitable, without the need for further capital-raising. Please see below some key ratios:

[Key Figures and Racios \(Spreadsheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/4in4xjk1ip8d1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3ca56d2832792b43b01027d6713a9aa36f311d)



Rocket Lab's current ratio suggests it has a comfortable buffer to cover short-term liabilities, while the quick ratio indicates a need to manage liquidity more tightly, potentially by improving the conversion of inventory to cash or managing receivables and payables more efficiently.



We can note, however, that due to R&D costs (110M and 65M in 2023 and 2022, respectively) the financial health has been deteriorating at a faster pace than the growth in revenues yoy of about 16% in 2023 and 239% in 2022.



Its relatively safe to assume R&D costs will decrease significantly after the Neutron Rocket is finalized and successfully launched in 2025.



**Will Rocket Lab USA survive until then?**



That brings us to Burn Rate and Runway analysis:



At the current burn rate of about 6667 thousand $ per month, we have an estimated runway of about 24 months, 2 years. This means that, at the current burn rate, Rocket Lab USA can still probably manage the remainder of 2024 and most of 2025 (which is the planned launch of first Neutron Rocket).



Asset Utilization: The asset turnover ratio of 0.25 suggests that Rocket Lab may have room to improve in utilizing its assets to generate more sales. This could involve better asset management or increasing sales without a proportionate increase in assets.



Inventory Management: The inventory turnover ratio of 1.25 indicates that Rocket Lab's inventory management might be less efficient, with inventory possibly sitting too long before being sold.



Receivables Efficiency: The receivables turnover ratio of 6.82 is a strong point, showing that Rocket Lab is efficient in collecting its receivables. This efficiency helps maintain good cash flow, which is crucial for a company that is not yet profitable.



**If Rocket Lab survives, how big could the upside be?**



List of assumptions for my forecasting:

1. Revenues will grow 30% in 2024 (slightly below their guidance, if assuming their Q12024 results would apply for Q2, Q3 and Q4 – if we assume their revenue of 93 M in Q1 to apply to the other quarters, it would equate to about 38% yoy increase), 30% in 2025 and 45% in 2026 (revenue increased based on estimated go-to-market of Neutron rocket launch services);
2. Cost of revenues will grow steady at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 1% increase).
3. R&D Costs will increase at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 83%) in 2024. We estimate that it will decrease by 40% in 2025 (due to finally releasing the Neutron Rocket, thus reducing R&D efforts). It will continue decreasing about 3% yoy into 2026.
4. SG&A will increase yoy at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 24%) until 2025, when it will start growing at 15% until 2026.
5. Income tax will be 21% the standard corporate income tax once company becomes profitable



Based on this bullish assumptions, Rocket Lab USA would turn profitable in 2026, turning in a net profit of approximately 106M $.

[Theoretical Valuation \(Spreadsheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/xa2bd893ip8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f90a922ad1b824b05c76e98a850f27c1077d965)



If we maintain the same Price-to-Sales multiple of approximately 8.69X, based on the forecasting with the assumptions laid out above, we can reverse engineer and calculate a theoretical market cap by multiplying our forecasted revenues with the PS ratio.

Bear in mind that the PS ratio will almost certainly not remain the same as investors are prone to pay lesser multiples on Sales throughout a company’s lifecycle, paying less and less as the company matures. This is merely an estimate of a potential valuation based on Revenue multiples.

The final value on 2026 would be 10,64 per Share, which is an upside of about 145% over the current price of 4,34 (COB 22 May).

This price of 10,64 $ per share and the estimated value of approximately 106M $ of Net profit would equate to a P/E Ratio of about 49,36. I consider this to be a fairly-valued multiple based on potential growth for this market, assuming Rocket Lab will become one of the most prominent players.



**How well is Rocket Lab USA being run?**



Would highlight Shaun O’Donnel’s extensive background as a very positive factor. Note, however, that Peter Beck, the founder of Rocket Lab USA, doesn’t have any background in the aerospace industry. It can be possible that they hire a CEO further down the line that brings in more experience managing similar business models.

So far their management team has managed to grow the company, making it currently the second most active launching service US company (based on # of launches data, which was presented previously).

They have already built 3 separated launch complexes (2 in the us and the other in New Zealand). They also own multiple manufacturing facilities for their avionics, rockets and engines.

I’d say that despite Peter’s lack of experience in aerospace industry, he has been doing a solid job growing Rocket Lab’s operations and deserves a vote of confidence in his ability to meet Rocket Lab’s shareholders expectations.



**Potential risks down the road…**

Biggest risk is Rocket Lab’s financial health. Based on the current burn rate, Rocket Lab will run out of money around the end of 2025. This means that they will require further financing. In case they are not able to capitalize themselves, there is a potential risk for bankruptcy. Note that the future burn rate could even be greater than the one calculated above, accelerating the capital needs.

1do46x3_NOC,NOC,Skyrocketing Returns: Invest in RKLB and the Future of Space Launches!,"**Have you heard about Rocket Lab USA?**

Aerospace and space launch service-provider: Rocket Lab USA is Elon Musk’s famous SpaceX, biggest competitor. What if I told you that a company that was founded in 2006 in New Zealand and headquartered in California only in 2013 is currently outpacing SpaceX’s growth?

You heard me right. This year, so far, Rocket Lab has launched a total of 9 payloads vs a total of 9 launches during 2023. If they maintain the pace throughout 2024, we might get a total of 18 launches or more, which equates an outstanding growth in # of launches of more than 100%. On the other hand SpaceX has launched a total of 60 times so far vs a total of 96 launches in 2023 ([SpaceX closes out record-breaking 2023, prepares for more records in 2024 - NASASpaceFlight.com](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2023/12/falcon-roundup/)). Keeping the same pace would mean SpaceX will launch about 120 payloads in 2024, which accounts for a growth rate of about 25% only.

Most analysts value SpaceX at over 180 Billion $. Note that, so far in 2024, it has launched close to seven times more payloads than its competitor Rocket Lab USA. Note, however, that Rocket Lab’s market value sits close to 2 Billion $, which would mean that SpaceX is valued around 100 times more than Rocket Lab USA currently is.

I’m sure I have raised your eyebrows already. Please be patient and bear with me for a minute, while I go through Rocket Lab’s fundamentals and explain my thesis on the following chapters.



**So, where is the money?**



Rocket Lab USA adds value to two main costumer segments:

B2B (Business to Business):

   * Private companies, particularly those in telecommunications, Earth observation, and technology demonstration sectors are looking for affordable access to space for launching and operating their small satellites.

   * Universities and research organizations utilize Rocket Lab’s services to deploy scientific instruments and experimental payloads, facilitating advancements in space science and technology.



B2G (Business to Government):

   * Rocket Lab serves various government and defense customers, including NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other international space agencies. These missions often involve scientific research, reconnaissance, and national security payloads.

They serve the above customers by monetizing the below added-value services:

1. **Electron Rocket Launches**:

   * **Small Satellite Launches**: The Electron rocket, designed to carry small payloads. It provides cost-efficient launches. See hereunder the KPIs for Rocket Lab’s flagship product:



[Electron KPIs \(Rocket Lab USA Website\)](https://preview.redd.it/xrbp8sorhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ff74c7e22a12acdf9f48d47fe1a3f7ce3d21ff)

2. **Neutron Rocket Launches** 

   * Neutron is being developed to carry larger payloads, targeting the medium-lift market.



**Which wave are we surfing here?**

A new report ([Space economy | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://www.weforum.org/publications/space-the-1-8-trillion-opportunity-for-global-economic-growth/)) by WEF states that space will be a 1.8$ Trillion opportunity by 2035. Currently space industry represents about 400 $ Billion In total valuation. That would be more than a 4X in the total valuation of the industry in only 11 years. Space launch services are one of the most important verticals within space industry.



**Who is well positioned to surf this wave?**

Even though there were a lot of small companies that partook on the “gold rush” that space launch industry is, there are not many players that stood the test of time and are still operating (note that we have only selected companies that either have launched payloads since the beginning of 2024 until now, or are planning to launch in the next few months):

[Neutron Rocket overview \(Rocket Lab USA Website\)](https://preview.redd.it/w0plzdlyhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4963a743cbad2f54fc190ed32e54ff476b1f95d8)

**Financial Performance**

Rocket Lab USA is still not profitable. I’d rather investigate its financial health and determine how solid their books are and if they will be able, or not, to reach their goals and become profitable, without the need for further capital-raising. Please see below some key ratios:

[Key Figures and Racios \(Spreadsheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/4in4xjk1ip8d1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3ca56d2832792b43b01027d6713a9aa36f311d)



Rocket Lab's current ratio suggests it has a comfortable buffer to cover short-term liabilities, while the quick ratio indicates a need to manage liquidity more tightly, potentially by improving the conversion of inventory to cash or managing receivables and payables more efficiently.



We can note, however, that due to R&D costs (110M and 65M in 2023 and 2022, respectively) the financial health has been deteriorating at a faster pace than the growth in revenues yoy of about 16% in 2023 and 239% in 2022.



Its relatively safe to assume R&D costs will decrease significantly after the Neutron Rocket is finalized and successfully launched in 2025.



**Will Rocket Lab USA survive until then?**



That brings us to Burn Rate and Runway analysis:



At the current burn rate of about 6667 thousand $ per month, we have an estimated runway of about 24 months, 2 years. This means that, at the current burn rate, Rocket Lab USA can still probably manage the remainder of 2024 and most of 2025 (which is the planned launch of first Neutron Rocket).



Asset Utilization: The asset turnover ratio of 0.25 suggests that Rocket Lab may have room to improve in utilizing its assets to generate more sales. This could involve better asset management or increasing sales without a proportionate increase in assets.



Inventory Management: The inventory turnover ratio of 1.25 indicates that Rocket Lab's inventory management might be less efficient, with inventory possibly sitting too long before being sold.



Receivables Efficiency: The receivables turnover ratio of 6.82 is a strong point, showing that Rocket Lab is efficient in collecting its receivables. This efficiency helps maintain good cash flow, which is crucial for a company that is not yet profitable.



**If Rocket Lab survives, how big could the upside be?**



List of assumptions for my forecasting:

1. Revenues will grow 30% in 2024 (slightly below their guidance, if assuming their Q12024 results would apply for Q2, Q3 and Q4 – if we assume their revenue of 93 M in Q1 to apply to the other quarters, it would equate to about 38% yoy increase), 30% in 2025 and 45% in 2026 (revenue increased based on estimated go-to-market of Neutron rocket launch services);
2. Cost of revenues will grow steady at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 1% increase).
3. R&D Costs will increase at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 83%) in 2024. We estimate that it will decrease by 40% in 2025 (due to finally releasing the Neutron Rocket, thus reducing R&D efforts). It will continue decreasing about 3% yoy into 2026.
4. SG&A will increase yoy at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 24%) until 2025, when it will start growing at 15% until 2026.
5. Income tax will be 21% the standard corporate income tax once company becomes profitable



Based on this bullish assumptions, Rocket Lab USA would turn profitable in 2026, turning in a net profit of approximately 106M $.

[Theoretical Valuation \(Spreadsheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/xa2bd893ip8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f90a922ad1b824b05c76e98a850f27c1077d965)



If we maintain the same Price-to-Sales multiple of approximately 8.69X, based on the forecasting with the assumptions laid out above, we can reverse engineer and calculate a theoretical market cap by multiplying our forecasted revenues with the PS ratio.

Bear in mind that the PS ratio will almost certainly not remain the same as investors are prone to pay lesser multiples on Sales throughout a company’s lifecycle, paying less and less as the company matures. This is merely an estimate of a potential valuation based on Revenue multiples.

The final value on 2026 would be 10,64 per Share, which is an upside of about 145% over the current price of 4,34 (COB 22 May).

This price of 10,64 $ per share and the estimated value of approximately 106M $ of Net profit would equate to a P/E Ratio of about 49,36. I consider this to be a fairly-valued multiple based on potential growth for this market, assuming Rocket Lab will become one of the most prominent players.



**How well is Rocket Lab USA being run?**



Would highlight Shaun O’Donnel’s extensive background as a very positive factor. Note, however, that Peter Beck, the founder of Rocket Lab USA, doesn’t have any background in the aerospace industry. It can be possible that they hire a CEO further down the line that brings in more experience managing similar business models.

So far their management team has managed to grow the company, making it currently the second most active launching service US company (based on # of launches data, which was presented previously).

They have already built 3 separated launch complexes (2 in the us and the other in New Zealand). They also own multiple manufacturing facilities for their avionics, rockets and engines.

I’d say that despite Peter’s lack of experience in aerospace industry, he has been doing a solid job growing Rocket Lab’s operations and deserves a vote of confidence in his ability to meet Rocket Lab’s shareholders expectations.



**Potential risks down the road…**

Biggest risk is Rocket Lab’s financial health. Based on the current burn rate, Rocket Lab will run out of money around the end of 2025. This means that they will require further financing. In case they are not able to capitalize themselves, there is a potential risk for bankruptcy. Note that the future burn rate could even be greater than the one calculated above, accelerating the capital needs.

1do46x3_RKLB,RKLB,Skyrocketing Returns: Invest in RKLB and the Future of Space Launches!,"**Have you heard about Rocket Lab USA?**

Aerospace and space launch service-provider: Rocket Lab USA is Elon Musk’s famous SpaceX, biggest competitor. What if I told you that a company that was founded in 2006 in New Zealand and headquartered in California only in 2013 is currently outpacing SpaceX’s growth?

You heard me right. This year, so far, Rocket Lab has launched a total of 9 payloads vs a total of 9 launches during 2023. If they maintain the pace throughout 2024, we might get a total of 18 launches or more, which equates an outstanding growth in # of launches of more than 100%. On the other hand SpaceX has launched a total of 60 times so far vs a total of 96 launches in 2023 ([SpaceX closes out record-breaking 2023, prepares for more records in 2024 - NASASpaceFlight.com](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2023/12/falcon-roundup/)). Keeping the same pace would mean SpaceX will launch about 120 payloads in 2024, which accounts for a growth rate of about 25% only.

Most analysts value SpaceX at over 180 Billion $. Note that, so far in 2024, it has launched close to seven times more payloads than its competitor Rocket Lab USA. Note, however, that Rocket Lab’s market value sits close to 2 Billion $, which would mean that SpaceX is valued around 100 times more than Rocket Lab USA currently is.

I’m sure I have raised your eyebrows already. Please be patient and bear with me for a minute, while I go through Rocket Lab’s fundamentals and explain my thesis on the following chapters.



**So, where is the money?**



Rocket Lab USA adds value to two main costumer segments:

B2B (Business to Business):

   * Private companies, particularly those in telecommunications, Earth observation, and technology demonstration sectors are looking for affordable access to space for launching and operating their small satellites.

   * Universities and research organizations utilize Rocket Lab’s services to deploy scientific instruments and experimental payloads, facilitating advancements in space science and technology.



B2G (Business to Government):

   * Rocket Lab serves various government and defense customers, including NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other international space agencies. These missions often involve scientific research, reconnaissance, and national security payloads.

They serve the above customers by monetizing the below added-value services:

1. **Electron Rocket Launches**:

   * **Small Satellite Launches**: The Electron rocket, designed to carry small payloads. It provides cost-efficient launches. See hereunder the KPIs for Rocket Lab’s flagship product:



[Electron KPIs \(Rocket Lab USA Website\)](https://preview.redd.it/xrbp8sorhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ff74c7e22a12acdf9f48d47fe1a3f7ce3d21ff)

2. **Neutron Rocket Launches** 

   * Neutron is being developed to carry larger payloads, targeting the medium-lift market.



**Which wave are we surfing here?**

A new report ([Space economy | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://www.weforum.org/publications/space-the-1-8-trillion-opportunity-for-global-economic-growth/)) by WEF states that space will be a 1.8$ Trillion opportunity by 2035. Currently space industry represents about 400 $ Billion In total valuation. That would be more than a 4X in the total valuation of the industry in only 11 years. Space launch services are one of the most important verticals within space industry.



**Who is well positioned to surf this wave?**

Even though there were a lot of small companies that partook on the “gold rush” that space launch industry is, there are not many players that stood the test of time and are still operating (note that we have only selected companies that either have launched payloads since the beginning of 2024 until now, or are planning to launch in the next few months):



[Number of Space Launches 2024 \(Spreadsheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/ljbv6n5thp8d1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e61085ea537293aae7d4865bc77bc360791f90)



**1. SpaceX (privately held company)**

* **Products offered**: Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

Since 2010 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy has launched more than 350 times, with a stellar record of only 2 failures, which represents a failure rate of less than 1%. SpaceX is by far the company that has the biggest share of space launch market.

This year SpaceX has launched a total of 60 payloads. Most of those payloads are StarLink satellites, but that makes it the US company that has been most active so far.



**2. Rocket lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB)**

* **Products offered**: Discussed in previous sections.

Rocket lab has launched a total of 9 payloads since the beginning of the year. This makes it the second most active player in the market thus far.



**3. United Launch Alliance, LLC (ULA)**

* **Products offered**: Vulcan Centaur VC2S and Delta IV Heavy rockets (mostly focused on heavy launches)

United Launch Alliance is a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). Both are listed companies you can invest in. It has launched a total of 3 payloads this year, making it the third most active player.



**4. Firefly Aerospace (privately held company)**

* **Products offered**: Alpha rocket for small and medium payloads.

Firefly Aerospace has a launch planned for June 2024.



**5. Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC)**

* **Products offered**: Minotaur IV launch system

Northrop Grumman Space Systems is a division of Northrop Grumman corporation that focuses on aerospace and defense technology. It is currently providing launch services for government and commercial contracts.

They also have a planned launch for June 2024.



**Does Rocket Lab USA have a moat?**



We all know that aerospace and space launch industry has huge entry barriers, as it is very capital-intensive and costly as a starting investment.

It is also not easy to be granted the permits to provide launching services in the USA.

A moat is a ditch that used to be dug around castles and fortifications. The whole idea behind it was to make it more difficult for enemies to invade. This term was popularized in the investment world by Warren Buffet, defending that companies should also have their own moats, to prevent market share being lost to new or existent competitors.

The biggest moats Rocket lab has are their proprietary technologies (uniquely distinguishable from their competitors) and the processes they have designed to ensure efficient launches, you might find some further details about both hereunder:

**Electron Rocket technologies and unique processes:**

   * Electron Rocket Engine - Rutherford is Rocket Lab’s proprietary engine, which has the following unique characteristics:

      * 3D Printed: Most of its components are 3D printed, which allows for a faster production and reduced manufacturing costs;
      * Battery-powered Pumps: Pumps are powered by lithium batteries, which effectively makes Rutherford the first battery-powered rocket engine;

   * Launching phases:

      * First Stage: The Electron’s first stage uses nine Rutherford engines, providing the thrust required to escape Earth's gravity.
      * Second Stage: A single Rutherford engine carries the payload into orbit.
      * Kick Stage: This optional stage provides precise orbital insertion for small satellites, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of the mission.

   * Reusability: First stage of Electron rocket is reusable. Rockets are refurbished after they have completed their mission.

Asset Utilization: The asset turnover ratio of 0.25 suggests that Rocket Lab may have room to improve in utilizing its assets to generate more sales. This could involve better asset management or increasing sales without a proportionate increase in assets.



Inventory Management: The inventory turnover ratio of 1.25 indicates that Rocket Lab's inventory management might be less efficient, with inventory possibly sitting too long before being sold.



Receivables Efficiency: The receivables turnover ratio of 6.82 is a strong point, showing that Rocket Lab is efficient in collecting its receivables. This efficiency helps maintain good cash flow, which is crucial for a company that is not yet profitable.



**If Rocket Lab survives, how big could the upside be?**



List of assumptions for my forecasting:

1. Revenues will grow 30% in 2024 (slightly below their guidance, if assuming their Q12024 results would apply for Q2, Q3 and Q4 – if we assume their revenue of 93 M in Q1 to apply to the other quarters, it would equate to about 38% yoy increase), 30% in 2025 and 45% in 2026 (revenue increased based on estimated go-to-market of Neutron rocket launch services);
2. Cost of revenues will grow steady at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 1% increase).
3. R&D Costs will increase at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 83%) in 2024. We estimate that it will decrease by 40% in 2025 (due to finally releasing the Neutron Rocket, thus reducing R&D efforts). It will continue decreasing about 3% yoy into 2026.
4. SG&A will increase yoy at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 24%) until 2025, when it will start growing at 15% until 2026.
5. Income tax will be 21% the standard corporate income tax once company becomes profitable



Based on this bullish assumptions, Rocket Lab USA would turn profitable in 2026, turning in a net profit of approximately 106M $.

[Theoretical Valuation \(Spreadsheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/xa2bd893ip8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f90a922ad1b824b05c76e98a850f27c1077d965)



If we maintain the same Price-to-Sales multiple of approximately 8.69X, based on the forecasting with the assumptions laid out above, we can reverse engineer and calculate a theoretical market cap by multiplying our forecasted revenues with the PS ratio.

Bear in mind that the PS ratio will almost certainly not remain the same as investors are prone to pay lesser multiples on Sales throughout a company’s lifecycle, paying less and less as the company matures. This is merely an estimate of a potential valuation based on Revenue multiples.

The final value on 2026 would be 10,64 per Share, which is an upside of about 145% over the current price of 4,34 (COB 22 May).

This price of 10,64 $ per share and the estimated value of approximately 106M $ of Net profit would equate to a P/E Ratio of about 49,36. I consider this to be a fairly-valued multiple based on potential growth for this market, assuming Rocket Lab will become one of the most prominent players.



**How well is Rocket Lab USA being run?**



Would highlight Shaun O’Donnel’s extensive background as a very positive factor. Note, however, that Peter Beck, the founder of Rocket Lab USA, doesn’t have any background in the aerospace industry. It can be possible that they hire a CEO further down the line that brings in more experience managing similar business models.

So far their management team has managed to grow the company, making it currently the second most active launching service US company (based on # of launches data, which was presented previously).

They have already built 3 separated launch complexes (2 in the us and the other in New Zealand). They also own multiple manufacturing facilities for their avionics, rockets and engines.

I’d say that despite Peter’s lack of experience in aerospace industry, he has been doing a solid job growing Rocket Lab’s operations and deserves a vote of confidence in his ability to meet Rocket Lab’s shareholders expectations.



**Potential risks down the road…**

Biggest risk is Rocket Lab’s financial health. Based on the current burn rate, Rocket Lab will run out of money around the end of 2025. This means that they will require further financing. In case they are not able to capitalize themselves, there is a potential risk for bankruptcy. Note that the future burn rate could even be greater than the one calculated above, accelerating the capital needs.

1dnhhr2_RKLB,RKLB,Why space industry and $rklb could be the next big thing,"I wanted to share my thoughts on why I believe the space industry, and specifically Rocket Lab, could be the next big thing. Here’s a quick breakdown:

1. Growing Space Economy: 

The space industry is booming, with projections estimating it could be worth over $1 trillion by 2040. Companies are not just focusing on launching satellites but also on space tourism, mining, and even colonization. This sector is becoming a significant part of our future economy.

2. Rocket Lab’s Competitive Edge:

Rocket Lab is positioning itself as a major player in this industry. Their Electron rocket is designed for small satellite launches, which is a rapidly growing market. Plus, they’re working on the Neutron rocket, which could potentially compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9.

3. Frequent Launches:

One of Rocket Lab’s strengths is their ability to conduct frequent and reliable launches. This reliability is crucial for building trust with clients and securing long-term contracts.

4. Diversified Services:

Beyond just launching rockets, Rocket Lab is moving into other areas such as satellite manufacturing and space systems. This diversification helps mitigate risks and opens up multiple revenue streams.

5. Government Contracts:

They have secured several contracts with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense, providing a steady stream of income and validating their technology and reliability.

6. Innovation and Reusability:

Rocket Lab is innovating with their reusability efforts, similar to what SpaceX has done. Reusability can significantly lower costs, making space access more affordable and frequent.

In summary, with the space industry set to explode (figuratively, of course!) and Rocket Lab’s strategic positioning and innovative approach, $RKLB could be a promising investment. As always, do your own research and consider the risks, but I think this is a sector worth watching closely.

1b8y6w7_RKLB,RKLB,Rocket Lab Bull Case,"Rocket Lab is in a very unique position to become one of the largest space companies in the world. 

Currently valued at only 2B dollars, there is tremendous room for growth. Their biggest competitor, Space X, is estimated to be valued at 180 billion dollars. 

Rocket Lab has successfully launched 44 rockets into space to date, while Space X has launched 316. Rocket Lab is quickly closing this gap because they have a private launch pad in New Zealand, a much more remote part of the world, which allows for more launch windows because they are not competing with as much airplane traffic. Launch cadence is going to be critical for rocket companies as more and more satellites are launched in the future. 

Currently there are roughly 8 thousand satellites in orbit, this number is estimated to rise to 58,000 by 2030. I see a future where nearly every major tech company will want their own satellite constellation. 

This is great news for Rocket Lab, because not only do they launch satellites, they also build them. This will mean Rocket Lab is the one stop shop for any company who wants a satellite constellation. 

This is all good and great, but what about financials. Rocket Lab’s revenue has been growing year over year by 240% in 2022 and 15 percent in 2023. Although, their net income is negative, they are expected to turn a profit of 43 million by 2026. 

Finally, Neutron is in the works! This will allow Rocket Lab to compete with Space X’s falcon 9, which will allow them to launch larger payloads, making mega constellations, deep spaceflights, and human spaceflights possible.

Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading provider of space launch services and advanced satellite technology, today announced it has been selected by and is under contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and build 18 Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta Data Transport Satellites (T2TL - Beta).

Rocket Lab will act as prime contractor for the $515 million USD firm-fixed price agreement, leading the design, development, production, test, and operations of the satellites, including procurement and integration of the payload subsystems. The contract establishes Rocket Lab’s position as a leading satellite prime contractor, providing supply chain diversity to the Department of Defense (DoD) through vertical integration. The contract comprises $489 million base plus $26 million of incentives and options and will be carried out by Rocket Lab National Security (RLNS), the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary created to serve the unique needs of the U.S. defense and intelligence community and its allies.  
  
The SDA is procuring satellites in two-year ""tranches"" to build out a proliferated constellation in LEO to deliver needed space-based capabilities to the joint war fighter. The T2TL – Beta satellites, part of the Tranche 2 program, will be integrated into SDA’s Transport Layer to provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide to meet DoD needs.  
  
“This contract marks the beginning of Rocket Lab’s new era as a leading satellite prime. We’ve methodically executed on our strategy of developing and acquiring experienced teams, advanced technology, manufacturing facilities, and a robust spacecraft supply chain to make this possible. It’s exciting to now be delivering this capability for government and commercial customers alike,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “SDA’s acquisition approach favors speed, schedule certainty, and affordability to deliver next-generation space capabilities to the nation. We’ve proven Rocket Lab is capable of delivering this across our launch and spacecraft programs and we look forward to delivering it for SDA.”  
  
All 18 satellites will integrate subsystems and components built in-house by Rocket Lab, including solar panels, structures, star trackers, reaction wheels, radio, flight software, avionics, and launch dispenser. This high degree of vertical integration gives Rocket Lab a rare level of control over supply chain, enabling efficiencies and certainty on cost, schedule and quality. The satellites will be built at Rocket Lab’s advanced spacecraft development and manufacturing complex within the Company’s Long Beach headquarters. The facility includes a 12,000 sq. ft. cleanroom and 40,000 sq. ft. of streamlined production & test facilities designed to support constellation class manufacturing and satellite assembly, integration and test for commercial, civil and national security customers. The satellites are scheduled for launch in 2027.  
  
As a leading provider of advanced spacecraft and components, Rocket Lab has a backlog of more than 40 satellites in development and production. Rocket Lab satellite technology and components have been integrated into more than 1,700 satellite missions globally.",2024-01-08,48,8

u8yxfx_HON,HON,Rocket Lab (RKLB) - Stage Recovery Attempt Pending = Huge Catalyst!,"**Summary:**

Rocket Lab (RKLB) will attempt a first stage recovery via helicopter capture during their next scheduled Launch. The “launch window” or time period when the launch can occur opens on ~~Friday April 22nd at 22:35 UTC~~ ,*~~edit - changed to Saturday April 23rd at 22:35 UTC~~*, *edit - now changed to April 29th at 22:35 UTC*. **If successful, Rocket Lab will become the first publicly traded company and second company ever (SpaceX)  to successfully recover a first stage in a condition possible for reuse.** Why does this matter? It's simple. 80% or more of the rocket’s cost to produce and launch is in the first stage. This will save RL a significant amount of money when stages are reused. Cost go down, launch rates go way up, and money will rain from the heavens (launch prices will stay the same as they have largely at SpaceX) …

**In other words, throwing away the first stage each flight is equivalent to throwing an entire airplane in the trash after a single flight. Recovery is everything for a profitable launch services company.**

**A Few Details:**

**1)**   This stock has been held down post IPO by the large internal investors (VC’s) selling off chunks of their long term holdings and the few internal shareholders selling their shares off (staff). This has now slowed as evidence in the decrease in volume the last few weeks. There were about 500 mil shares outstanding around IPO, the 6 month lockup ended right around the 1st of March. Volume increased immediately and hung around pretty high for most of the month allowing those early VC’s a good chunk of cash if needed:

**2)**  I estimate that perhaps as much as 50% of the shares held by the VC’s are liquidated and that this has been bought by large banks / financial institutions whose analysts all believe the stock should be worth $18 / share on average.

Parts of the article:

*In a major announcement for the company, Rocket Lab released news that it will attempt a mid-air helicopter recovery of the Electron vehicle’s first stage in the next scheduled launch, later this month.*

*Currently, the company complements the Electron rocket with the Photon customizable orbital spacecraft. Looking forward, Rocket Lab is developing the Neutron rocket, a large-scale reusable launch system, which will be able to deploy a 13,000kg payload into low Earth orbit, or a 1,500kg payload into an orbital trajectory to Mars or Venus. During 2021, Rocket Lab was awarded a contract from the US Space Force, worth $24 million, to complete development of the Neutron’s upper stage.*

*Building on its launch program, and to raise capital for its development program, Rocket Lab entered the public markets in August of last year. The stock’s entry to the NASDAQ came through a business combination with a SPAC firm, Vector Acquisition Corporation, and brought the space launch company as much as $777 million in gross proceeds.*

*Since going public, Rocket Lab has reported fiscal results for three quarters, starting with 2Q21 last September. The company saw zero revenue in that quarter – but reported $5.3 million in 3Q21, which more than quintupled to $27.5 million in 4Q21. Full-year revenue for 2021 came in at $62.2 million, up 77% year-over-year.*

*Kristine Liwag, Morgan Stanley’s resident expert on the Aerospace & Defense sector, sees the upcoming helicopter retrieval attempt as the key catalyst for Rocket Lab, writing: “We view RKLB’s upcoming mid-air booster retrieval attempt as a potential near-term catalyst as a successful operation would reflect a key milestone as the company executes on its strategy to increase rocket reusability (and thus lower cost).”*

*Going on, Liwag points out how this retrieval capability will set Rocket Lab apart from its peers: “We view the company’s ongoing and planned innovations in rocket reusability enabling Rocket Lab to potentially further widen the moat between itself and competitors... These innovations could enable recovery of \~70-80% of each rocket’s economic value, allowing Rocket Lab to potentially further drive down vehicle costs and insulate itself from potential pricing pressures engendered by rival small launch offerings and rideshare services.”*

*In line with her comments, Liwag rates Rocket Lab shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $17 price target to imply a robust 109% upside for the stock. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here)*

*Overall, with 6 recent Buy ratings overpowering a single Hold, Rocket Lab gets a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The shares are priced at $8.11, and their $18.86 average target suggests \~133% upside from that level.*

**3)**  Why do I think the institutions are buying? Because Rocket Lab has bought back all their outstanding SPAC warrants reducing the risk to traditional larger investors moving in.

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211222005551/en/Rocket-Lab-Announces-Redemption-of-All-Outstanding-Warrants](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211222005551/en/Rocket-Lab-Announces-Redemption-of-All-Outstanding-Warrants)

Excerpt from the article:

*LONG BEACH, Calif.--(*[*BUSINESS WIRE*](https://www.businesswire.com/)*)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (the “Company” or “Rocket Lab”) today announced that it will redeem all of its outstanding public warrants (the “Public Warrants”) to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock that were issued under the Warrant Agreement, dated as of September 24, 2020, by and among Rocket Lab USA, Inc.*

**4)**  Mix that in with some really good acquisitions, and I think this is the catalyst that RL needs to more than double in price. These include satellite electronics, satellite solar power generation, satellite mechanisms and separation systems. They have diversified as well and now are winning satellite construction contracts outside of just their launch business:

Rocket Lab Recent Acquisitions:

*US-based space company Rocket Lab has agreed to buy satellite solar cell manufacturer SolAero Holdings for USD80 million in cash, adding another piece to its fast-growing portfolio.*

*The acquisition is the third that Rocket Lab has announced this year as it seeks to expand beyond its core business of launch vehicles. The company purchased spaceflight software provider Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI) in October, and spacecraft separation systems firm Planetary Systems Corporation in early December.*

**5)** Rocket Lab have already done the required practice catches and mid ocean recoveries.

Helicopter practice catch:

**In short**, I think this is a great buy. Worst case, this recovery attempt doesn’t succeed, and they keep trying till it does.

**TDLR** \- Buy Rocket Lab if you think reusability of the rocket = $$ like I do. The stock is held down and will moon if they catch the stage during the next launch in the next few days. Worst case, they catch it on a future flight.

thnfwo_RKLB,RKLB,"Space related stocks: ASTR, RKLB, ASTS","Hello all. I have been taking advantage of the recent pull backs to initiate a space position. Surprisingly so have found few recent discussions including ASTR and they have had some new catalysts so I’m hoping to get others thoughts here. Disclosure: I am long ASTR and I’m considering going long RKLB and ASTS. 

ASTR had a wild week! Many are aware that ASTR had a failure in their last launch attempt which resulted in the price falling to below $3 briefly. ASTR was able to rapidly identify the cause, fix it and attempt to fly again. That tells me they have built the important process improvement mechanisms internally to iterate rapidly successfully. ASTR had a successful return to flight on Tuesday BUT the rocket lost connection right before the payloads were to be deployed. This was eerily similar to the last failure which occurred at a similar time in the launch and caused enough people to freak out to cause an over 20% drop and then mostly recover when successful deployment of all satellites was confirmed although trading was halted for volatility briefly. Then on Thursday ASTR delayed earnings release to 3/31 which caused a further 6% drop. 

Today the CEO interviewed on CNBC and provided clarification on a number of points. The loss of signal was simply due to the launch angle and lack of radio antennas in the Pacific Ocean. It would have been helpful if they had informed everyone of that expected event beforehand, but oh well. The earnings release date change was due to a change in reporting status but he reiterated a positive outlook. Lastly he touched on the increased demand the launch industry will see due to Russia exiting the market. He also claimed ASTR is making a rocket a month currently. ASTR closed up nearly 14% today. 

ASTR up to recently has been significantly shorted. According to Fintel there is a 23.07% short interest and 40.37% off exchange short volume. 

ASTR will likely benefit enormously from the Russian conflict. In addition to customers needing rides that they can’t use in Russia, the military may significantly increase their use. The US Space Force was one of ASTR’s first customers. The ability to launch from nearly anywhere to any orbit on short notice provides the military with options that no one else can meet. ASTR also is planning on a point-to-point system for Rocket 4. The ability to get a small payload anywhere in the world in 90 minutes may provide a significant market. It’s essentially the same Rocket 3 they are making with a modified second stage so the cost to develop shouldn’t be crazy high.

The earnings call provides an opportunity for significant positive catalysts that might trigger reinforcements higher from the open short positions. There are planned launches monthly for the next few months. Of course a failure would be a significant negative catalyst. 

Why is ASTR still off prior highs in the 12-15 range? They had multiple failures in 2021 as well as multiple lawsuits alleging that capabilities and market size presented were false. 

ASTR closed at $4.60 and I plan to continue to go long via calls. Baring a failure in the near future, ASTR seems poised to enjoy high demand for service while decreasing costs. 

I have followed RKLB as a space enthusiast but I am planning on initiating a position. Most discussions I have read have compared RKLB and ASTR as an either or and I now believe that is false. As SpaceX moves into starship RKLB will expand into near American Broomstick 9 size payloads. RKLB’s Neutron seems well positioned to be significantly less expensive than Falcon 9 and able to launch 80% of the payloads currently flying on the American Broomstick. With ASTR able to launch cheaper than Electron I believe both will evolve into their own markets and complement each other. RKLB has recently developed a new lightweight highly efficient solar panel that is radiation hardened. Diversifying income into supplying solar panels seems like an excellent earnings center. 

ASTS is developing a space based cell phone system intended to supplement terrestrial systems. Assuming the technology will work then the success will depend on funding and execution. ASTS has major backing from current networks and one would assume they are committed to building out such a network. Execution recently received a thumbs up when the company secured multiple launches with SpaceX through 2024. With Soyuz off the market demand will exceed capacity for awhile, but ASTS secured their rides. The upside for such a network is limitless, and with war in Europe raging the need for satellite access for citizens is desperately clear. 

I believe all three companies complement each other well. ASTR is a high beta play with a beta at 2.14. This elevation, however reflects a launch failure that has now been corrected and a return to flight conducted. If my thesis for these companies is true, then the upswing in stock price will be significant. If I am wrong there will likely be violent share erosion. For these reasons I have chosen to use longer dated OTM call options. 

This is my first review. I hope you found this helpful and I invite feedback.",2022-03-19,41,40
s6a07j_RKLB,RKLB,Can someone walk me through RKLB financials?,"I'm generally a higher risk investor - a company like RKLB and its wild swings in price isn't exactly uncommon for me. I look at something like MSFT going from $340 to $308 (which I called back in early December by the way) as rather boring....I only say this though because I really value your guy's ability to digest the fundamentals.

About middle of the last year I wanted to change up how I do things, I wanted to hybridize my strategy and accumulate companies I think are highly volatile but actual long-term gems....eventually.

The problem is I can't make enough sense (hide nor hair) of fundamentals.

To me, do they have debt yes or no? Do they meet the qualifications of ""Rule of 40"" yes or no? Is all I've needed.

Now I'm coming to love RKLB's future, especially from a technical/engineering perspective which I understand much better and like to assume that RKLB will therefore eventually profit from. So my comfortability with volatility is growing into ""marrying the stock"".

And I want to learn how to measure the company's actual performance without regards to its share price performance.

A lot of people in this space (pun intended) typically just throw money at it they are willing to lose, hold their breath for 5 years, and hope they landed on a diamond mind.

I don't want to do that.

I want to learn how to go to the ""balance sheet"" page or go to the quarterly financials and know what I'm looking at and what I'm looking for and why.

And I want to learn how to do it so that I can keep an eye on it and get more or less conviction of the future of a volatile, high-risk company like RKLB. I'm very convicted on the stock based on its current and future proposed intellectual property and engineering expertise as well as plant production....

But that doesn't mean it will translate into financial conviction as a company performs for its shareholders.

***So thanks in advance for anyone who wants to take a look at this. You can give me your opinions, but I'd rather you just start with the same worksheet I'm working with and tell me where to look first, second third and so on, and then how to start to paint the picture.***

[**New-Space**](https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestorEmpire/?f=flair_name%3A%22New-Space%22)📷

I think the TA strongly points to a possible $13.50 by end of FEB. From the looks of it - RKLB will follow the trending path I drew in red, based on VWAP and where its Force Index currently sits.

But I don't really see it having enough strength to sustain above Daily 100MA (which is similar to a 20 MA Weekly).

So it will either bounce off the bottom or overshoot it some.

Putting the price somewhere around $13.50.

Macro economic situations may directly influence this and keep the price around $11....but yesterday suggests a reversal (some uptrend), that the FEDs and all unexpected, now expected, hikes and balance sheet reduction have largely been priced in.

I argued a week or so ago that the majors (deep pockets) were actually selling the volume on value/safety, and buying the fear on risk.

I made a thread titled ""They are stealing your shares!"" about that very issue.

Today we see it playing out in real time - guess who already owns all the shares they want as we see RKLB starting to bounce up...that's right. The majors/Deep-pockets.

ql4gtb_RKLB,RKLB,Rocket Lab (RKLB) DD,"Rocket Lab is an American aerospace company that went public on the NASDAQ on the 25th August 2021 at $10.43/share. It is currently trading at $14.33/share. They have launched 20 times (18 successful) putting 105 satellites in orbit. [https://www.rocketlabusa.com/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)

Rocket Lab has two main businesses: as a launch provider and satellite manufacturing.

Launch Provider:

Rocket Lab’s current vehicle is called Electron. It is a small-lift vehicle capable of putting 300kg into LEO (Low Earth Orbit) at $7.5 million launch cost. The purpose of a vehicle this small is as a dedicated ride for small satellites, which historically have had to ride as secondary payloads on larger vehicles. A dedicated, small-sat launcher priorities these customers who have had to wait years to hitch a ride on a medium to heavy lift launcher when there was room. The only operational competitor to Electron is Virgin Orbit’s Launcher One (500kg to LEO at $12 million). However, there are a multitude of companies promising small sat launchers at a smaller cost such as Astra (630kg to LEO at $2.5 million, although this rocket has failed to reach orbit 4 times it is getting very close), Firefly’s Alpha (1000kg to LEO at $15 million, again this vehicle failed to reach orbit the one time it was launched) among many others preparing for their first launch. The launch market is not that elastic and it is clear not all of these vehicles will survive in the market. So, Rocket Lab has begun to embrace reusability to lower launch costs for Electron by catching the first stage out of the air with a helicopter, an unusual approach, but one that negates the need for heavy landing legs on the vehicle.

The company’s upcoming vehicle is Neutron, a medium lift launcher capable of 8000kg to LEO. Nothing is known about Neutron’s design, except that the vehicle will be ‘nearly 100% reusable’. Rocket Lab plans to have it operational by 2024. If the rocket lives up to expectations, there will be a duopoly on the medium lift market: Neutron and SpaceX’s Falcon 9. This is far more sustainable than the small lift launch market. This rocket is also at the size to be feasible to launch satellite constellations, of which there are many in planning. Rocket Lab has also said that Neutron will be capable of human spaceflight. This is incredibly exciting and presents huge opportunities for government contracts and tourist missions as SpaceX is currently the only American entity capable of putting humans in orbit.

Space Systems:

Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and every other launch provider have all realized the same thing: there isn’t actually that much money in launching satellites for customers. SpaceX has negated this by becoming their own customer by launching hundreds of Starlink satellites to become an internet provider. Rocket Lab has also moved into the place where in the real money is in the industry: satellite manufacturing. Along with acquiring two companies for selling both software and hardware to other companies, they have developed their own ‘kickstage’ called Photon (starting to see a naming pattern?). Photon is genius as Electron would never be able to send a satellite to the Moon, Mars, or beyond as it is simply too small. Instead they launch a satellite on Photon to LEO. Then, Photon can transport that payload to anywhere in the solar system. It is like a third stage that is launched with the rocket instead of part of it. The important thing here is that *it can launched on other vehicles.* If Falcon 9 or any other rocket can’t get a customer’s payload to it’s required destination due to any multitude of reasons, Photon can be launched with the payload to complete the mission. This could be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab in the future.

Financial Results:

Rocket Lab did an Investor Presentation for their first half of 2021 which included some impressive numbers. In one year, they have gone from a $5.9 million deficit to $3.9 million gross margin, while increasing R&D spending by 156%. Their space systems revenue have also increased to 18% of total revenue from 3% last year. The gross margins for space systems is a ridiculous 65%, and I only expect their revenue to grow from here. Their net loss has decreased from $31 million to $23 million in the last year.

Investor Presentation: [https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc\_presentations/2021/09/Rocket-Lab\_1H-2021-Financial-Results\_FINAL.pdf](https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_presentations/2021/09/Rocket-Lab_1H-2021-Financial-Results_FINAL.pdf)

In my opinion this stock is a very strong buy due to huge potential for growth and the company’s ability to access multiple parts of the aerospace market which is forecasted to double by 2030.

The new space race has begun fellas, and this time it’s between companies. I think Rocket Lab has a part to play.

In space he can’t fuck your wife, and there is NO AIR so he can’t make fun of your micro-penis anymore!

But isn’t that so fucking expensive you might be thinking…

WRONG! Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket technology has made it SUPER cheap for personalized launches and is absolutely butt fucking their competition (Jeff who??)

They also have SUPER cheap options

Let Me Explain…  


**Technology:**

RKLB’s Electron rocket was the second most launched rocket this year, working with the likes of Space Force and NASA

This is currently the only small reusable rocket on the market, and smaller rockets give lots of benefits to consumers such as privacy and time scheduling

They are now working on their larger Neutron rocket which will be incorporated into the Artemis program by sending payloads to the Moon and Mars

Space is a growing market, so being able to invest in one of the frontrunners is amazing!  


**Competitors:**

Besides SpaceX, RKLB is absolutely shitting on their competition, even with a much smaller budget

Jeffrey Bezos can barely even get his (rocket) up (into orbit), let alone do it cost effectively

Besides Blue Origin, there is Astra Space which has been focusing more on satellites than rockets right now

There is room for multiple players in this market, and currently I see Rocket Labs as being in the #2 spot behind SpaceX  


**Options Price:**

RKLB’s options are super fucking cheap due to low OI and being down 12% in just the past week

It is extremely oversold and seems to be poised for massive upside on ANY good news

New Space Force/NASA contracts will absolutely catapult this stock up

In this market what matters is not fundamentals, but how cool a company is, and what is cooler than literally shooting things up into space? Fucking badass  


**Positions:**

In addition, there has been interesting news regarding the space launch industry as a whole, specifically with respect to satellite constellation launches for providing greater accessibility to affordable high bandwidth internet, all over the world (yay), and real-time global surveillance via satellites with 50cm camera precision (kinda & oh no).

News
1. Amazon Project Kuiper 🔥 - Amazon had announced its own internet satellite constellation project to launch 3k satellites by 2026-2029. Initial 6 or 9 flights assigned to ULA. RKLB’s constellation supporting rocket, Neutron, is set to be ready to launch in 2024, ready in time to *maybe* capture some business from Amazon IN ADDITION to all of the ISPs that are going to be banging launch providers doors down, to not get left out of the next great revolution in global internet coverage. 
2. RKLB’s space systems business 👀 - RKLB just announced it had signed a deal to supply reaction wheels “for a number of undisclosed satellite constellations.” AFAIK satellites need 3 reaction wheels to control their orientation on all 3 axes (keeping a 4th as backup). Their production facility at initial capacity will output 2000 a year. 2000 / 4 == 500 satellites a year they are expecting to provision. For reference they’ve only launched 100 satellites themselves so far.
3. Astra (ASTR) 😪 - had 2 failed launches last weekend in a row, still haven’t made it to orbit, still valued at about 1/2 that of rocket lab (what is wrong with this market). Launch reliability should carry a premium, rocket lab has a proven track record of launch reliability.
4. Firefly (private) 😪 - watching their livestream of launch right now, and it’s not going too well (called an abort). But we’ll see how it goes…

Some Key Upcoming Events
1. September 8, Earnings 🍿 - likely will hear status updates regarding larger neutron rocket, as well as their space systems business (please tell us about the contracts regarding reaction wheels mentioned above).
2. Lunar Mission 2021 (probably Q4) 🌝 - do I even have to say anything? What other space startup is set to fly to the moon this year, for NASA? What doors will this open for them 🚪?
3. September-October, Back to back to back launches for global surveillance company Black Sky 👀 - this is very interesting as rocket lab has never turned around rockets this fast before. Demonstrating extremely rapid launch cadence will be proving to customer that they can schedule launch on demand essentially. In months, eventually weeks but not years. I expect to also see rocket lab demonstrate reusability of their electron rockets, by catching some with a helicopter (not joking) 🚁.

Summary:
1. Rocket lab is in a much better position than other space startups that are either still in theoretical phase (never launched), and those that are trying to launch but just can’t seem to get their rockets flying in the proper direction (Astra).
2. Entrance of tech giants and ISP heavy weights into satellite constellation business is evidence that we are on the brink of a satellite launching party (from all ISPs to avoid getting amazoned, and want to keep their consistently high cash flow business models: Verizon, AT&T, etc.). From all the launches, the planet might heat up a few degrees 😓.
3. Their neutron rocket is being developed at the right time to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts for such constellations (I also really doubt any one launch provider has the bandwidth to take all the contracts).
4. Their space systems business (reaction wheels for one), will be a nice revenue stream, even for the satellites that they don’t launch themselves, yet still develop and produce key parts of.

From all the launches, the planet might heat up a few degrees 😓.
3. Their neutron rocket is being developed at the right time to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts for such constellations (I also really doubt any one launch provider has the bandwidth to take all the contracts).
4. Their space systems business (reaction wheels for one), will be a nice revenue stream, even for the satellites that they don’t launch themselves, yet still develop and produce key parts of.

pgp0gh_RKLB,RKLB,$RKLB literally going to to moon,"Here’s my attempt at a DD into Rocketlab and why I’m incredibly bullish on it. I’m not a financial advisor. I’m just a smooth brained ape that likes seeing flamey sticks go up high in the sky. 

• Rocketlab is literally the only main competitor to Elon’s Space X, currently valued well over 15x RKLB’s value.

• They have over 100 successful launches of their 3D printed Electron rockets and will be launching from the US this year.

• Currently developing their Neutron Rocket which will be very similar to the Falcon 9, given their track record I fully believe they’ll have this is in operation by their target year of 2024. Of course, Space X is ahead of them in this regard, but there is room for competition in this sector. 

• Developing on-orbit refuelling, this is something Space X are also developing with Starship, Rocketlab want to do this with their Photon satellites, which are currently operational, so it’s very possible they could do this before Space X.

• Their CEO literally ate his hat in a promo video. He’s New Zealand Elon Musk, what else is there to say?

•They already have contracts from NASA and the US Space Force including a literal moon mission!

• Cathie is very likely to add RKLB to her Space ETF soon, which will increase the price.

It’s entirely possible they could reach Space X levels of valuation in the next 5-10 years. That would represent a 1500% gain. 

As the space industry grows, who knows how big they could get beyond that?",2021-09-02,1712,266
peo1vz_RKLB,RKLB,"Rocket lab, mini space x?","How do you guys feel about rocket lab and it's potential for long term? They are in the commercial launch market using small reusable rockets and have a good track record and backlog of contacts. Some of which involve putting satellites in orbit around the moon (2021) and Mars (2024). Currently I think their valuation is pretty fair, but I also think the commercial launch sector is going to explode in the next 5 years and they seem to be in a really good position to be a front runner as well as make key acquisitions for growth. What are your guys thoughts? No analyst is covering them yet, they are fresh off the spac press and I'm sure ppl are still weary about spacs.",2021-08-30,54,31

pb2qes_RKLB,RKLB,Rocket Lab (RKLB) 🚀🌝,"If you don’t know what Rocket Lab is, consider SpaceX without the hype man CEO. Next take away the big rockets (and replace with 17m tall rockets that change colors when being fueled up, called ‘Electron’).

What you have left is a company that’s trading at roughly 4 to 5 billion market cap (far cry from SpaceX’s 80 to 90 billion) that has successfully launched over 100 satellites to orbit, and the clear 2nd in the private orbital launch service domain.

Why I have loaded up on Rocket Lab:

1. Low market valuation relative to peers (i.e SpaceX is already at lofty valuation, leaving less room for price growth, believe around $90 billion). Virgin galactic was trading at almost 2x the market cap, $10 billion, for a while with a lot less to show for it, and countless delays. Astra is trading about half the market cap of rocket lab (without even delivering 1 customer payload to orbit yet?).

2. Proven ability to get to orbit. 20+ successful launches, with 100+ satellites in orbit.

3. Small rockets aren’t as bad of a limitation as you’d think initially, actually provides greater flexibility with launch dates, and more granular orbit positions for customer satellites (and I’ve read that 98% of satellites would be able to fit on electron, but I need to find the link that references this).

4. Plans to use raised capital to fund larger ‘Neutron’ rocket, being built for human space flight, and to further compete with SpaceX as an orbital launch provider for satellite constellations.

Rocket lab will finally list tomorrow as $RKLB, and will be ringing the opening bell on NASDAQ tomorrow morning.

**Rocket Lab USA** via **Vector Acquisitions (VACQ)**

March 2nd 2021 (BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch and space systems, and Vector Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq: VACQ) (“Vector”), a special purpose acquisition company backed by leading technology investor Vector Capital, announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement that will result in Rocket Lab becoming a publicly traded company. The transaction is estimated to be completed in Q2 2021 and, at that time, Vector will change its name to Rocket Lab USA, Inc. and the combined company will trade under the Nasdaq ticker symbol RKLB.

**Vector Capital (vectorcapital.com)**

A Technology centered investment firm with 25 years in business and $3 Billion in equity capital under management. Some notable investments include *Corel, LANDesk, Register.com, SafeNet, Technicolor, Teletrac, WatchGuard and WinZip.*

Vector prides themselves in their “value creation team”, supporting their portfolio companies in driving revenue growth through business strategy, supply chain optimization, cost structure, IT infrastructure, finance, tax, HR.

**Some Vector highlights:**

·  $3+ Billion under management

·  40+ Investing and operating professionals

·  100+ tech companies acquired since 1997

·  39% gross IRR since inception

**Rocket Lab (rocketlabusa.com)**

Rocket Lab is a friendly competitor to SpaceX. They are the ONLY two private companies to deliver regular and reliable access to orbit. Rocket is vertically integrated from rocket and satellite production to launch and control. They have focused on “small launch” allowing them to bring satellites to orbit at a much lower cost ($5-6mil as opposed to SpaceX @ around $58mil due to using their large Falcon 9) and at a higher frequency thanks to their 3 launch sites with 132 launch opportunities a year. They have a command lead on any other private company in small launch, SpaceX doesn’t do it and the only company with a successful launch is Virgin Orbit with 1 launch and 9 satellites delivered to orbit. There are quite a few companies attempting to get into small launch, ASTRA being notable, they have yet to complete a launch.

**Some Rocket Lab highlights:**

·  18 launches to space

·  97 satellites deployed to orbit

·  3 launch pads built (2 in Virgina USA 1 in New Zealand)

·  2nd most frequeuntly launched US rocket behind SpaceX (4th most in the world behind China and Russia)

·  7 successful missions with USG customers 

·  1 strategic acquisition (bringing satellite production in house)

·  2 factories built (able to produce 1 rocket a week)

·  1 of their own satellites in orbit with more to come (bringing “space data” as a revenue stream “*space- based connectivity, Earth observation (including synthetic aperture radar, electro-optical and RF) and other services”.*)

·  1 rocket recovered (making their rockets reusable)

·  3 Interplanetary missions scheduled (for NASA to the Moon,Mars,Venus)

·  Impressive growth; The company began in 2014 and is miles ahead of any competition in small launch. 

***Who even wants small launch?*** 

Currently Rocket lab’s customers include 50% commercial, companies like Canon, and Tyvak for their various earth imaging, GPS,  general earth observation and network needs. 30% Defense agencies for a command influence in space and various mapping, strategy / spy stuff? Rocket is able to provide “on demand” launch within 24 hours which I can see being helpful in a defense situation and maintaining satellite constellations. 20% Civil agencies like NASA for weather, general research etc. The space sector is just starting to heat up with a Market forecasted to grow to $1.4T by 2030. With over 20 customers already satisfied Rocket lab has a unique ability to continue the relationships for future business and this is shown with current bookings for 2021 representing 90% of their $69m of forecasted revenue this year. This is a 96% YoY growth for Rocket.

*Some market and financial points,*

·  Total available market (TAM) of $350B projected to grow to $1.4T by 2030

·  Small satellite constellations will account for 83% of all satellites launched by 2028 (currently a $20B TAM which Rocket is involved)

·  Expect to increase revenue through Space applications a $320B TAM by creating their own constellation of small satellites (currently 1 in orbit; more to follow)

·  Small satellite launches are currently a $10B TAM (Rocket is currently involved and is miles ahead of any competitor)

·  Rocket Lab forecasts that it will generate positive adjusted EBITDA in 2023, positive cash flows in 2024 and more than $1 billion in revenue in 2026. 

**Vector Capital SPAC merger points**

·  Transaction will provide capital to fund development of reusable Neutron launch vehicle (medium/heavy lift) with an 8-ton payload lift capacity tailored for mega constellations, deep space missions and human spaceflight.

·  Proceeds also expected to fund organic and inorganic growth in the space systems market and support expansion into space applications enabling Rocket Lab to deliver data and services from space.

·  Group of top-tier institutional investors have committed to participate in the transaction through a significantly oversubscribed PIPe (**Private Investment in Public equity**) of approximately $470 million, with 39 total investors including Vector Capital, BlackRock and Neuberger Berman.

·  Up to $320 million of cash held in Vector Acquisition Corporation’s trust account (assuming no redemptions by Vector’s public shareholders).  

·  Business combination values Rocket Lab at an implied pro forma enterprise value of $4.1 billion. Pro forma cash balance of the combined company of approximately $750 million at close. 

·  Following the closing of the transaction, the Company will continue to be led by Founder and CEO Peter Beck. Alex Slusky, CEO of Vector and CIO and Founder of Vector Capital, will join Rocket Lab’s Board of Directors alongside Sven Strohband of Khosla Ventures, David Cowan of Bessemer Venture Partners, Matt Ocko of DCVC and Mike Griffin, independent director. 

In closing, Rocket Lab seems well positioned to continue its dominance in the small launch sector and with this new capital injection and additional management insight I think they will continue their impressive growth into the medium launch/space systems/space application biz. They seem to have a healthy and motivated company atmosphere and have built a business from the ground up that will last. At this point I would say the “space race” particularly pertaining to small launch is theirs to lose and there is seemingly room to grow alongside SpaceX in the medium category. See what you think!
