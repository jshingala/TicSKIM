1kt3kfs_ROKU,ROKU,Deep dive into Roku - The Streaming Razor-and-Blades Model,"I recently looked into Roku, and here's my full deep dive:

TLDR:

\- Roku is giving away its OS for free and selling the hardware at a loss to get as many users as possible.

\- The monetization is all about ads

\- The current market cap isn't far from the fair value

1h6yt8c_ROKU,ROKU,Roku‚Äôs real value is in the data.,"I want you to ask yourself a question:

How valuable are the things we pay attention to? 

**Half** of American households have a Roku device.

Roku is the leading streaming TV distributor in the U.S., reaching nearly 120 million people.**Roku's audience is larger than the subscribers of the six largest traditional pay-TV providers combined.** It is the #1 smart TV streaming OS in the US, Canada and Mexico.

Source: https://developer.roku.com/docs/features/features-overview.md

As of the third quarter of 2024, Roku has 85.5 million active accounts worldwide, which is the company's highest ever, a 12.8% increase from Q3 2023.

Streaming time per active user: 246.8 minutes per day in Q3 2024, a 5.8% increase from Q3 2023

As part of Roku‚Äôs privacy policy, they collect:

‚ÄúInformation about your activities, like the channels you install or access (including usage statistics such as what channels you access, the time you access them, and how long you spend viewing them), and information about the videos and other content you select and stream within these streaming services. If you use the Roku Media Player to view your video or photo files or listen to your music files, Roku will collect data about the files viewed within the Roku Media Player, such as codecs, and other metadata of the local files you play.‚Äù

https://docs.roku.com/published/userprivacypolicy/en/us

Why do you think they practically give away their streaming sticks? The money isn‚Äôt in their devices, it‚Äôs in the data they collect on you. 

Google‚Äôs in a similar business. They have 4.97 billion users, and their market cap is 2.14 Trillion. The valuation is 428x the amount of users.

If we applied the same multiples, that means $ROKU is worth around a 37 Billion dollar market cap, putting $ROKU at $250 a share. 

I‚Äôd venture to say it‚Äôs more around $750 a share, given the majority of Roku‚Äôs users are in the US.

Let‚Äôs see what this holds.

1h70dsx_NFLX,NFLX,"'Expects Roku to be bought for a ""large premium"", Ad viewing across programs gives it pricing power' - Needham analyst (Laura Martin)","Needham analyst talking to Bloomberg: 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-12-04/needham-sees-acquisition-appeal-for-roku-video

From Interactive Brokers commentary:

> Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated a Buy rating and $100.00 price target on Roku Inc. ROKU.

> The analyst commented: ""Yesterday, Walmart closed its $2.3B acquisition of Vizio, which was announced in Feb 2024. Walmart's urgent need was driven by AMZN's decision to make all 200mm of its Prime Video subscribers ad- driven in Jan 2024. AMZN then linked its CTV ads to actual purchases made on its site, thereby creating the first RMN (retail media network) with ""closed-loop attribution"". Walmart will now ""fast follow"" AMZN and create a better RMN by tying Vizio's CTV ads to Walmart's online and offline sales.

> We expect Roku to be purchased for a large premium within the next 12 months. We believe that there are several categories of potential purchasers including streamers (NFLX, etc), CTV ad buyers (TTD, etc), retailers (Target, etc), and LLMs (large language models) hungry for billions of new data points daily (AMZN/AWS, MSFT/OpenAI, GOOGL/YouTube/Gemini, etc). The top 6 reasons to acquire Roku (our view) include its installed base, unique data sets, pricing power, shelf space, buy vs build advantages, and the fact that it's now the only scaled CTV platform that can be purchased",2024-12-05,11,9

1491lkj_ROKU,ROKU,Better Cathie Wood stock: Roku vs. Shopify," 

**Roku** and **Shopify** are two of Cathie Wood's favorite long-term holdings. The famed growth investor's flagship exchange-traded fund, the **Ark Innovation ETF**, holds Roku as its second-largest position (7.99% of its portfolio) and Shopify as its eighth-largest position (4.55%).

Both companies grew rapidly throughout the pandemic as consumers watched more streaming videos on Roku's devices and did more online shopping through Shopify-powered storefronts. But they both faced tough post-pandemic slowdowns as those tailwinds dissipated, and rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth stocks.

 That's why in 2022, Roku's stock plunged 82%, Shopify's stock fell 75%, and the Ark Innovation ETF shed 67% of its value. But since the beginning of 2023, shares of Roku and Shopify have both soared more than 70% as the Ark Innovation ETF rallied 36%. Does that rebound indicate it's finally safe to buy either stock again? 

#  Roku's post-pandemic slowdown isn't over yet

Roku's revenue rose 58% in 2020 and 55% in 2021, but grew just 13% to $3.1 billion in 2022 as its platform and device businesses faced near-term challenges. Its higher-margin platform business, which sells ads across its Roku OS and free Roku Channel, struggled as the macro headwinds forced companies to rein in their ad spending. Its lower-margin device business grappled with supply chain constraints, high component prices, and stiff competition from other streaming device makers. 

 Roku's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned negative with a loss of $84 million in 2022, compared to a profit of $465 million in 2021, as its platform gross margins shrank and its device gross margins remained negative throughout the entire year. That pressure on its device business will likely worsen because it's absorbing its higher supply chain costs instead of passing them onto its consumers. It also recently launched its own first-party Roku TVs, which it will likely need to sell at paper-thin margins or even losses to remain competitive. 

 On the bright side, Roku's audience continues to expand. It ended the first quarter of 2023 with 71.6 million active accounts, representing 17% growth from a year earlier, and its streaming hours continue to rise sequentially and year over year. Unfortunately, the softness of its advertising business is still making it hard to grow its average revenue per user (ARPU), which declined 5% year over year in the first quarter.

For 2023, analysts expect Roku's revenue to rise 5% to $3.3 billion, but they expect its adjusted EBITDA loss to widen to $269 million. But in 2024 they expect its revenue growth to accelerate again as its adjusted EBITDA turns positive. 

#  Shopify's post-pandemic growth is stabilizing

 Shopify's self-service e-commerce tools enable merchants to launch their own online storefronts, process payments fulfilll orders, and manage their own marketing campaigns. That flexibility makes it a popular choice for sellers who don't want to join a crowded third-party marketplace like **Amazon**. It also became an essential tool for both merchants and customers when brick-and-mortar stores closed down during the pandemic. 

 Shopify's revenue rose 86% in 2020 and another 57% in 2021. Its adjusted net income jumped 1,332% in 2020 and grew 66% in 2021. But in 2022, its revenue only grew 21% as its adjusted net income plunged 94%. Its top-line growth cooled off as the pandemic passed, but it continued to ramp up its spending to expand its lower-margin Shop Pay payments platform and logistics network. Its acquisitions of 6 River Systems and Deliver, which were both aimed at strengthening its logistics capabilities, exacerbated that pressure on its operating margins. 

 Shopify's slowing growth and plummeting profits rattled the bulls, but the company has recently made some drastic changes. During its first-quarter earnings report, management told investors that Shopify would sell its entire logistics division to Flexport for a 13% stake in the private company. It also said it would lay off about a fifth of its workforce to stabilize its profits.¬†

As a result, analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 20% in 2023 as its adjusted EPS grows a whopping 700%. 

#  The valuations and verdict

Roku trades at three times this year's sales, while Shopify trades at 13 times this year's sales. Roku is trading at a lower valuation because it hasn't convinced the market its business model is sustainable, but investors are still paying a premium for the long-term growth potential of Shopify's e-commerce services.

I wouldn't rush to buy either of these stocks right now. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with Shopify because it's growing faster, making bolder decisions, and its business model seems more disruptive.",2023-06-14,0,8

 **Roku ($ROKU)**

Roku generates a significant portion of its revenue through advertising and content distribution services on its streaming platform. The company also sells streaming devices. Roku‚Äôs revenue grew 1% to $741 million in Q1 2023 and surpassed analysts‚Äô estimates. It reported a lower-than-anticipated loss per share of $1.38, although losses widened considerably compared to $0.19 in the prior-year quarter.¬† ¬†¬†

 

The average revenue per user (ARPU) declined 5% year-over-year to $40.67. The company expects advertising spend to remain under pressure throughout this year due to macro challenges.

## Is Roku a Good Stock to Buy?

Following the Q1 results in late April, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein maintained a Buy rating on Roku stock but lowered his price target to $75 from $85. Explaining his investment stance, the analyst stated that platform revenue has stabilized, with upcoming tailwinds from advertisers, agencies, retail media, and DSP integrations.

Given headwinds from slowing ad spend by subscription video on-demand (SVOD) providers and higher ‚Äúscatter market exposure,‚Äù Helfstein expects Roku to be one of the first beneficiaries of any recovery in the ad market.

Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Roku is based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and three Sells. The average price target of $69.74 implies about 25% upside. ¬†

## Tesla ($TSLA)

Investors were unimpressed with Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter performance, as the company‚Äôs earnings declined due to the impact of price cuts on margins. The company also cited underutilization of new factories, higher raw material, commodity, logistics, and warranty costs, and lower revenue from environmental credits as the reasons for margin contraction.

 

During the Q1 earnings call CEO Elon Musk justified the company‚Äôs pricing strategy, saying that a focus on higher volumes and a larger fleet is the ‚Äúright choice‚Äù than lower volumes and higher margins. Musk expects Tesla‚Äôs vehicles to generate significant profit over time through its autonomy feature.

Following multiple price cuts, Tesla recently hiked the prices of several cars in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan. Nonetheless, prices remain lower than the levels seen at the start of this year.

 

## Is Tesla a Buy, Hold, or Sell?

Earlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter lowered his price target to $280 from $300 but reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst reduced his 2023-2025 estimates to reflect price cuts and their impact on margins. While Potter agrees with management's view that margins will eventually rise due to software, he contends that this won't happen quickly enough to offset the near-term impact of lower prices, higher warranty costs, and slower inventory turnover.

On the positive side, Potter thinks that the global average selling price (ASP) could fall by \~$125 per unit every quarter for the next two years without hurting margins due to production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Until margins and other fundamentals start improving, Potter believes that TSLA might struggle to ‚Äúcatch a bid.‚Äù¬†Nevertheless, he remains bullish on the stock and expects investors to turn around in the second half of the year and beyond.

 Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Tesla is based on 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and four Sells. The average price target of $202.15 suggests nearly 20% upside.

## Block ($SQ)

Shares of fintech Block declined sharply in March after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of inflating the number of users on its Cash App system. The company shook off these concerns by reporting better-than-expected Q1 2023 results last week.

Adjusted EPS jumped 122% to $0.40 in Q1 2023, driven by a 26% rise in revenue to about $5 billion and enhanced margins. Results gained from solid momentum in the company‚Äôs Cash App peer-to-peer ecosystem. Cash App‚Äôs gross profit increased 49% to $931 million. Meanwhile, Square, the company‚Äôs ecosystem focused on merchants, delivered a gross profit of $770 million, up 16% from the prior-year quarter.

Based on the gross profit momentum in Q1, the company increased its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to $1.36 billion from the previous guidance of $1.30 billion. ¬†¬†

## What is the Price Target for SQ Stock?

Following Block‚Äôs results, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $80 from $95, given the lower market valuations for stocks in the payments space.

 

The analyst highlighted that Q1 results beat expectations because the robust momentum in the Cash App business offset softer seller trends as volumes faded during the quarter. Tandon remains positive on Block based on the company‚Äôs focus on driving profitable long-term growth and an expanding product suite as payments continue to shift to digital channels.

With 23 Buys and seven Holds, Square earns Wall Street‚Äôs Strong Buy consensus rating. At $91.19, the average price target suggests 58.5% upside.

Explaining his investment stance, the analyst stated that platform revenue has stabilized, with upcoming tailwinds from advertisers, agencies, retail media, and DSP integrations.

Given headwinds from slowing ad spend by subscription video on-demand (SVOD) providers and higher ‚Äúscatter market exposure,‚Äù Helfstein expects Roku to be one of the first beneficiaries of any recovery in the ad market.

Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Roku is based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and three Sells. The average price target of $69.74 implies about 25% upside. ¬†

## Tesla ($TSLA)

Investors were unimpressed with Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter performance, as the company‚Äôs earnings declined due to the impact of price cuts on margins. The company also cited underutilization of new factories, higher raw material, commodity, logistics, and warranty costs, and lower revenue from environmental credits as the reasons for margin contraction.

 

During the Q1 earnings call CEO Elon Musk justified the company‚Äôs pricing strategy, saying that a focus on higher volumes and a larger fleet is the ‚Äúright choice‚Äù than lower volumes and higher margins. Musk expects Tesla‚Äôs vehicles to generate significant profit over time through its autonomy feature.

Following multiple price cuts, Tesla recently hiked the prices of several cars in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan. Nonetheless, prices remain lower than the levels seen at the start of this year.

 

## Is Tesla a Buy, Hold, or Sell?

Earlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter lowered his price target to $280 from $300 but reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst reduced his 2023-2025 estimates to reflect price cuts and their impact on margins. While Potter agrees with management's view that margins will eventually rise due to software, he contends that this won't happen quickly enough to offset the near-term impact of lower prices, higher warranty costs, and slower inventory turnover.

On the positive side, Potter thinks that the global average selling price (ASP) could fall by \~$125 per unit every quarter for the next two years without hurting margins due to production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Until margins and other fundamentals start improving, Potter believes that TSLA might struggle to ‚Äúcatch a bid.‚Äù¬†Nevertheless, he remains bullish on the stock and expects investors to turn around in the second half of the year and beyond.

 Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Tesla is based on 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and four Sells. The average price target of $202.15 suggests nearly 20% upside.

## Block ($SQ)

Shares of fintech Block declined sharply in March after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of inflating the number of users on its Cash App system. The company shook off these concerns by reporting better-than-expected Q1 2023 results last week.

Adjusted EPS jumped 122% to $0.40 in Q1 2023, driven by a 26% rise in revenue to about $5 billion and enhanced margins. Results gained from solid momentum in the company‚Äôs Cash App peer-to-peer ecosystem. Cash App‚Äôs gross profit increased 49% to $931 million. Meanwhile, Square, the company‚Äôs ecosystem focused on merchants, delivered a gross profit of $770 million, up 16% from the prior-year quarter.

Based on the gross profit momentum in Q1, the company increased its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to $1.36 billion from the previous guidance of $1.30 billion. ¬†¬†

## What is the Price Target for SQ Stock?

Following Block‚Äôs results, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $80 from $95, given the lower market valuations for stocks in the payments space.

 

The analyst highlighted that Q1 results beat expectations because the robust momentum in the Cash App business offset softer seller trends as volumes faded during the quarter. Tandon remains positive on Block based on the company‚Äôs focus on driving profitable long-term growth and an expanding product suite as payments continue to shift to digital channels.

With 23 Buys and seven Holds, Square earns Wall Street‚Äôs Strong Buy consensus rating. At $91.19, the average price target suggests 58.5% upside.

(Bloomberg) -- Roku Inc., the maker of set-top boxes consumers use to watch Netflix and other streaming services, slumped in late trading after forecasting a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and saying advertisers‚Äô budgets are under pressure.

The adjusted loss this quarter may come to $135 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Roku said Wednesday. That‚Äôs three times the $45.5 million analysts were expecting.

Roku is the latest technology or media company to announce weakness in advertising sales. The company said it expects a tough economy to pressure consumers and advertiser spending through the holiday season. 

‚ÄúWe expect these conditions to be temporary, but it is difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound,‚Äù Roku said in a letter to shareholders.

The company forecasts fourth-quarter revenue of about $800 million, below the current $897 million average of analysts‚Äô estimates.

Shares of San Jose, California-based Roku tumbled as low as $41.15 in extended trading after the company announced the forecast, along with third-quarter results. The stock closed at $54.32 in regular trading in New York and is down 76% this year.

The company plans to rein in expenses and slow hiring growth due to current conditions. It also said Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden plans to leave the company next year.

Roku reported Q3 earnings and revenue that are better than analysts expected. Overall revenue was 12% higher year-over-year and the total streaming hours was also up 21% during the same period. However, with economic uncertainty and the likelihood of companies canceling ad budgets, Roku expects to see a decline in revenues for the holiday season and projected lower earnings for Q4. They believe the slowdown should be temporary but it's hard to predict when it will stabilize or rebound.

yhq40i_ROKU,ROKU,"Expected moves this week. SPY, QQQ, AMD, Starbucks, Roku, Draftkings and more","## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì**¬†SPY rose 3.9% last week, despite disappointing earnings (and gaps lower) in big cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, (Apple‚Äôs 7.5% move higher, bucked the trend and helped close the week on a high note). That SPY move higher followed a 5% rally the week before. It is now about 10% above the recent lows. QQQ was up about 2.2% on the week, underperforming the broader market and weighed down by those earnings reports. QQQ is now about 8% higher than its recent lows. The Dow is about 14% higher.

Volatility fell across the board, with the VIX now below 26, both because of the move higher but also with a huge percentage of the SPX market cap now having reported.

**This Week ‚Äì**¬†SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 26, its lowest levels since mid September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

The economic calendar this week features both the FOMC, where a 0.75 rate increase is expected, and the NFP jobs number to round out the week.

While it's true Roku is a growth stock and many are getting hit, it seems pretty difficult to justify, going from it's high of almost $500 to now around $80. Financially, they are making money, and exceeding their EPS, actually quite significantly. Only bearish argument I can think of is being a covid pandemic stock, but even then, people are still watching shows, which makes it difficult as mentioned to justify, such a price difference. 

Does anyone who holds or contemplated or even simply researched Roku have a bullish or in this case bearish argument to explain what's happening? Would you say it's a buy?",2022-06-20,49,107

sv33qc_SNOW,SNOW,Roku plunges -22% on disappointing revenue and guidance,"Roku shares fell as much as 20% in extended trading on Thursday after the video-streaming company issued fourth-quarter revenue and first-quarter revenue guidance that came in below consensus.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

Earnings: 17 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 9 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
Revenue: $865.3 million, vs. $894.0 million as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
Revenue grew by 33% year over year in the quarter, according to a letter to shareholders, compared with 51% growth in the third quarter and 81% in the second quarter.

With respect to guidance, Roku called for $720 million in first-quarter revenue, which implies 25% revenue growth. The Refinitiv revenue consensus was $748.5 million. Roku said it sees $55 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, in the first quarter, below the $79.2 million consensus among analysts polled by FactSet.

Roku expects revenue growth in the mid-30s percentage range for all of 2022, Steve Louden, the company‚Äôs finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected 36% growth. Louden said the company sees EBITDA would be consistent with 2020, when it was $150.0 million.

Not long after the announcement, Roku was trading at its lowest point since June 2020. During Thursday‚Äôs trading session, in which the S&P 500 index fell 2%, Roku‚Äôs stock had gone down 10%. Setting aside the after-hours move, Roku stock has fallen about 37% since the start of 2022, while the S&P was down about 8% over the same period.

Management attributed the slower growth to supply shortages that hurt the U.S. market for televisions.

‚ÄúSimilar to Q3, overall U.S. TV unit sales in Q4 fell below pre-COVID 2019 levels,‚Äù Anthony Wood, Roku‚Äôs founder and CEO, and Steve Louden, its finance chief, wrote in the letter. ‚ÄúSome of our Roku TV OEM partners were hit particularly hard with inventory challenges, which negatively impacted their unit sales figures and market share in Q4.‚Äù

The company chose not to pass on higher material and shipping costs in order to benefit user acquisition.

‚ÄúWhile we expect market conditions to result in player-related costs remaining elevated for the near term, we do not believe these conditions will be permanent,‚Äù Wood and Louden wrote.

Roku reported 60.1 million active accounts in the fourth quarter. That figure was up 17% year over and year and more than the 59.5 million that analysts polled by StreetAccount had been looking for. The number of hours each active account watched declined year over year.

In the fourth quarter, the company‚Äôs Platform segment, which includes digital advertising subscription and revenue sharing and sales of branded buttons on remote controls, generated $703.6 million in revenue, up 49% and lower than the StreetAccount consensus of $732.2 million. Platform revenue had grown 82% in the third quarter. The segment‚Äôs gross margin came in at 60.5%, narrowing from 65.0% in the third quarter.

Automotive and consumer packaged goods companies endured their own supply challenges, which resulted in light advertising spend, Wood and Louden wrote.

Player revenue, from sales of streaming players and audio devices, totaled $161.7 million, declining 9% as analysts surveyed by StreetAccount had expected $162.5 million.

In the quarter Roku said it had completed an agreement with Google to keep YouTube and YouTube TV on its service.

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was lower by about 2% last week, in line with the 2% move options were pricing. Implied volatility closed higher on the week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a 2.5% move this week (about $11 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** ‚Äì The VIX closed last week above 27, up from 23 the week before. The majority of that move higher was on Friday. Mid-week the VIX got as low as 20 as the SPY topped out near $457 before its intra-week decline of almost 4%.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.5%** (about $11)
* QQQ **3.3%** (about $12)
* IWM **3.3%** (about $7)
* DIA **2.2%** (about $8)

### In the News

Inflation, the Federal Reserve, and Russia/Ukraine headlines continue to cause day-to-day sentiment shifts in the market. When uncertainty reigns, implied volatility tends to make large moves as well. Last week was a prime example as the VIX saw both 20 and 30 within a few days of each other. Traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop when entering new positions as that can help inform strategy.

Using SPY as an example, at its peak last week near $457, the VIX was 20. A bearish position placed on that day could take the form of a put spread purchase, or a call spread sale. In the case of the credit call spread sale, the timing would have worked from a delta perspective as the markets reversed lower, but implied volatility spiked significantly with that move lower, adding a drag on potential gains of those short deltas.

Conversely, following a decline and a VIX above 30, a trader can choose between a call/call spread purchase or a credit put/put spread sale to position for a rally. In the case of the put spread sale, on a market rally implied volatility will decline, adding vega profits to delta profits. Conversely, a debit call spread will see delta gains on a rally, but be negatively affected by sharply declining IV.

This is much more of a factor when implied volatility is seeing large swings (as it is now), affecting near-term options in an atypical manner.

When uncertainty reigns, implied volatility tends to make large moves as well. Last week was a prime example as the VIX saw both 20 and 30 within a few days of each other. Traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop when entering new positions as that can help inform strategy.

Using SPY as an example, at its peak last week near $457, the VIX was 20. A bearish position placed on that day could take the form of a put spread purchase, or a call spread sale. In the case of the credit call spread sale, the timing would have worked from a delta perspective as the markets reversed lower, but implied volatility spiked significantly with that move lower, adding a drag on potential gains of those short deltas.

Conversely, following a decline and a VIX above 30, a trader can choose between a call/call spread purchase or a credit put/put spread sale to position for a rally. In the case of the put spread sale, on a market rally implied volatility will decline, adding vega profits to delta profits. Conversely, a debit call spread will see delta gains on a rally, but be negatively affected by sharply declining IV.

This is much more of a factor when implied volatility is seeing large swings (as it is now), affecting near-term options in an atypical manner.

ryejsh_ROKU,ROKU,"Let's talk about ROKU, kids.","## **Introduction**

 I have been pumping ROKU stock for some time. The last time I wrote up some bullish DD was August 2019. The most extensive DD I wrote was Aug 2018 when it was trading at $60/share (I'll link it below). The reasons I like the stock then (very fast growth in users + ARPU) as well as the long-term durability of a business that comes attached to a several hundred dollar device (heavy, not something you move in a whim) still apply. The recent drops make me more bullish on the company than I have ever been. 

## **The Company**

ROKU is a profitable, fast-growing advertising technology company (like Facebook, Twitter, or Google) that sells television devices as well as software that runs on those devices. Founded in 2002, it is even older than Facebook and Twitter, but didn't IPO until 2017. 

The profitability growth experienced by ROKU since its IPO has been phenomenal -- the vast majority of the stock's performance comes from the performance in its financials, rather than to multiple expansion. ROKU IPO-d at 10x gross profit and now trades at about 20x gross profit -- while gross profit increasing about 7x over the same timeframe. Last quarter, ROKU clocked a 70% YoY increase in gross profit -- the flywheel is still moving at an incalculable rate.

Sales growth has been more modest, remaining in the 50%-60% range but gross profit growth is more reflective of the strength of the business, as ROKU's revenue lumps together one minimally unprofitable + moderate growth business (sales of players) with a highly profitable + fast growing one (sales of targeted ads + other platform fees). 

It's surprising to consider that ROKU is still growing its top line about as quickly as when it IPO-d, but mathematically, this is because small declines in platform growth rate have been offset by the business as a whole increasingly reflecting this faster growing segment. As the platform business is now around 75%-80% of the business, future revenue growth will increasingly reflect platform growth, not player growth. Hence, this shift in mix toward the faster-growing business should continue to act as a tailwind for the company's relative financial performance, even as the growth from this business itself slows over time.

To make a long story short, ROKU's top-line growth is not likely to slow down in the coming years, as both this minor tailwind and minor headwind should be anticipated to roughly offset one another for years to come. Consistent growth at 50%+ for any non-negligible amount of time leads to big numbers, quick.

## **Future Performance**

ROKU continues to grow extremely quickly, and the stock should continue to benefit from increased revenues & profits, as well as from multiple expansion.

## **10- Year Risk**

Warren Buffett likes to ask whether a company in 10 years might have revenues and profits that are not substantially increased from where they are today. In ROKU's case, the risk of this outcome is essentially zero -- even if users stopped growing tomorrow and never resumed, ARPU growth alone could carry the business. As a profitable company, there is no risk to ROKU the company should the capital markets dry up in a big way (though this would of course hurt the stock).

## **Competitive Landscape**

ROKU reports having the #1 market share in the US & Canada, as well as growing market share in its new international markets -- Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom & France Expansion to new geographies in Europe & Lat/Am is on the immediate horizon. 

ROKU describes its international strategy as ""doing what worked in the US, but in other countries."" Indeed, this does seem to be working.

## **The Setup**

Back in 2020, ROKU came to be seen as a ""pandemic stock"" -- a company that benefited greatly from one-time factors experienced during the corona pandemic. So for 2021, the comps were tough, and the stock took a hit. The result is a severe market overreaction -- ROKU grew like a weed prior to the pandemic, it grew like a weed during the pandemic, and, it will grow like a weed after the pandemic. The coronavirus affected annual growth rates and profits in a big way, but it did not affect the intrinsic value in a similar way.

The stock is more than 50% off from its highs, even lower than it traded pre-pandemic, while being the strongest company that it has ever been with no signs of stopping.

qwdhgz_ROKU,ROKU,"Roku stock plunges after downgrade; estimates ‚Äòare just too damn high,‚Äô says analyst","Shares of Roku Inc. are getting pummeled Wednesday after an analyst downgraded the stock and suggested that investors have misinterpreted the company‚Äôs story as of late.

‚ÄúWhen a stock goes up on a series of strong and better than expected results, few probing questions are ever asked as the outperformance is usually a confirmation of an investment thesis,‚Äù MoffettNathanson‚Äôs Michael Nathanson wrote Wednesday.

Accordingly, he argues that investors may have been too upbeat about the extent that Roku‚Äôs ROKU, -11.34% advertising performance helped drive its results while understating the impact of new streaming launches.

Nathanson cut his rating on Roku‚Äôs stock to sell from neutral, while lowering his price target to $220 from $330. ‚ÄúSimply put, we think our and the Street‚Äôs long-term revenue and earnings estimates are just too damn high,‚Äù he wrote.

By his math, ‚Äúit appears that Roku will need to monetize an absurdly high portion of long-tail AVOD [ad-based video-on-demand] impressions to come even close to Street numbers, which we think willbe a challenge given rising competitive pressures in TV OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and operating systems,‚Äù he continued.

Roku‚Äôs stock sank 9.8% in morning trading, putting them on track to suffer the biggest one-day selloff in a year, and to close at a one-year low.

Nathanson believes Roku has ‚Äúespecially benefited from the launch of new DTC [direct-to-consumer] services over the past year,‚Äù but he worries about how that momentum will continue.

‚ÄúThe amount of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations from content distribution agreements has notably increased since 2Q 2020, but we believe these performance obligations should begin to moderate,‚Äù as Roku continues to lap the launches of new streaming services, Nathanson said.

By Nathanson‚Äôs estimations, Roku added about $79 million in new performance obligations during the third quarter, ‚Äúwhether from new distribution agreements or revaluation of existing agreements.‚Äù That amount is ‚Äúmeaningfully lower than the estimated $450+ million added each in 1Q 2021 and 2Q 2021,‚Äù he wrote, which he sees as reflective of a ‚Äúpotential slowdown‚Äù in streaming purchases and promotional spending on Roku‚Äôs service.

Of the 28 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Roku‚Äôs stock, 21 have buy ratings, four have hold ratings, and three have sell ratings, with an average price target of $387.96.

Shares of Roku, which are headed for the lowest close since Nov. 18, 2020, are up 5.2% over the past 12 months, but have lost 30% over the past three months. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.26% has rallied 30.0% over a 12-month span and gained 5.5% over a three-month span.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! We‚Äôve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we‚Äôve got plenty of opportunities to make some money.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we‚Äôll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who‚Äôve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There‚Äôs no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush.

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-10-31,120,37

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! We‚Äôve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we‚Äôve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that‚Äôs not to say that there isn‚Äôt chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Let‚Äôs get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we‚Äôll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who‚Äôve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There‚Äôs no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and that‚Äôs only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe we‚Äôre going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% (or $7.40) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY just under **$460** that corresponds to just above **$464** on the upside and around **$455** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** ‚Äì The VIX ended Friday around 16.20, up slightly from the week before. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

Options are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.7%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here‚Äôs an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $455 and $464 to see Max Gain:

## In the News

The FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

The *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you‚Äôre looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we‚Äôll experience. Since they‚Äôre reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What‚Äôs there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I‚Äôll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they‚Äôre Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven‚Äôt had much time to review any extra trades given that I‚Äôve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they‚Äôre Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven‚Äôt had much time to review any extra trades given that I‚Äôve been extremely busy this weekend.

#Summary and Conclusion

We‚Äôve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we‚Äôve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha.

ov9lo3_ROKU,ROKU,7-28-21 Daytrade Recap: ROKU,"I hope this will be informative into showing how a daytrader plans out a trade while simultaneously trading a ticker. Today's recap will focus on **ROKU** and showcases the mindset into what this trader was doing. So let's get to it:

[Timestamp: 8:46 AM CST](https://preview.redd.it/mt02rh2klke71.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cc0a3a6588e84ba7bec7745cbacb89e088d93a1)

The trader entered ROKU at roughly 8:46 AM watching for a reversal pattern to develop. Knowing how ROKU performs, she entered nearly at the bottom of the candlestick where she presumed that it will reverse off the 50 MA on the 5 minute chart. ROKU is a volatile ticker and premiums are known to rise and fall extremely fast per candlestick so entering on a solid red candle off a potential support would have a high chance of reward.

&#x200B;

[Timestamp: 8:58 AM - 9:05 AM](https://preview.redd.it/c39bcw4llke71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a2f5d302ccf26a3b84442cc074c5a1a5edc834)

The trader outlined a target in mind from a prior support level in the first image. 463 was her first target for this trade as she **patiently** waited for the candles to reverse alongside QQQ and SPY. If it did not reverse, her stop was a close under the 50 MA. Daytrades, especially ones dealing with options, often move quickly. If you see a setup often enough, you can trade it successfully more times than not.

There we have it. Two targets planned and it worked out as intended. Some cases it will not work but you have to take a leap of faith and believe in the trade. Trades will fail but have a plan and keep emotions out of this game of ~~gambling~~ trading.",2021-07-31,5,3

The major growth in Amazon's advertising unit means its revenue contribution is now 2.4 times larger than Snap, Twitter, Roku and Pinterest combined, and it's growing 1.7 times as quickly, according to Loop Capital. 

Amazon's ""Other"" unit, which is primarily made up of advertising but also includes sales related to other service offerings, grew revenue a massive 77% year-over-year to more than $6.9 billion in the first quarter, the company reported last month.

This is another bright spot of amazon stock. Ad revenue is highly profitable like AWS, so it could use the profit to support other business. The ad revenue is growing very fast so it could able to compete with FB and Googl in the future. The stock is trading under $3300, investors should consider buying some and hold.

Ticker has been really bullish the past few days and was on my watchlist in hopes of getting a swing entry on a 4h higher low. It had a 1m EQ form at the start of the day and I went long. I played a smaller than normal position because I wasn't super confident in this one due to expecting 4h consolidation. The decision to go long was largely based upon SPY/QQQ doing bullish things at the open.

jzp0yf_ROKU,ROKU,Question about Roku's Ad business,"I've been interested in the Ad space of late. Seems the major players here are Google, The Trade Desk, and.... Roku?? I understand the business models of Google with their Search dominance and Youtube. And The Trade Desk seems to have created the de facto bidding platform for all advertising that's not on Google. But I see many analysts from the Motley Fool, Cramer and others talk up Roku's advertising business. However I think they do a poor job explaining how that ad business works. In short, I don't understand where and how they make money on advertising. 

I'll use myself as an example. I own a Roku TV and I think it's great. However pretty much the only channels I watch are YouTube TV, YouTube app, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO. My guess is I'm a fairly typical user. Other than the single Ad I get in the Roku Screensave with King Kong (Roku owners will know what I'm talking about), how is Roku delivering ads to me and others? Where and how is all this advertising revenue coming in for Roku? Hopefully someone can explain the piece of the puzzle I'm missing here. ty",2020-11-23,2,4

**ROKU (+$345.19)**

Gapped up to ATH today. After it opened strong I was looking for the 5m/15m to play out as a Bull Flag. I took 2 trades with that in mind. I was watching the 2m chart and based the entries off of green reversal candles, where the 5m EMAs were, and what QQQ was doing on the 2m/5m.

The San Jose, Calif.-based company earned 9 cents a share on sales of $451.7 million in the September quarter. Analysts expected Roku to lose 40 cents a share on sales of $367.8 million. In the year-earlier period, Roku lost 22 cents a share on sales of $260.9 million.

Roku has been investing heavily in international expansion and its advertising-supported, video-on-demand services.

The company added 2.9 million active accounts in the third quarter, giving it a total of 46 million user accounts. Average revenue per user increased 20% year over year to $27 in the period.",2020-11-06,12,3

j1m8iy_ROKU,ROKU,DocuSign; Roku & Lemonade.... 3 stocks I think are looking interesting?,"DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) outperformed in its last quarter, and earlier this month. It also has a strong increase in total paying customers who brought in 45% more revenue in the fiscal 2021 second quarter than the previous year.

Additionally, net losses for the past six months declined about $2 million year over year, shrinking from 25% of total revenue for the first six months of 2019 to 18% this year.

Roku stock is up for a 52% year-to-date. 

Despite NBCUniversal threatening to cancel Roku's licensing rights for all of its content channels if the media-streaming expert didn't agree to the studio's proposed terms for streaming service Peacock, the companies worked out their differences over the weekend of Sept. 20. 

This resulted in Roku's shares surging 21% higher on the following Monday and Tuesday.

Although I‚Äôm more cautious about this stock since the stock price has raced approximately 15% ahead of the S&P 500 since July 10, but nothing has changed much for the company itself.



Lemonade is an insurance technology company that leverages artificial intelligence to sell renters and homeowners insurance, Lemonade IPO'd in July and is currently trading roughly 75% higher than when it was first priced at $29 per share.

I feel it‚Äôs incredibly unique in its sector and could pave a new way for insurance companies. 


‚ÄúBetween the second quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of this year, the company grew customers by nearly 84%, reaching 814,000. Also, the loss of $21 million is the smallest loss Lemonade has reported in the last year. Lemonade is also seeing success at attracting younger customers, which is not always so common in the insurance business. More than 70% of the company's current customers are younger than 35, and many are suspected to be first-time customers.‚Äù -[MarketFoolery ](https://www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/09/27/better-buy-lemonade-vs-rocket/)",2020-09-28,2,7

i4tf19_ROKU,ROKU,"$ROKU - still a lot of bulls post Q2, but the bears seem to be winning today","**The Bulls:**

**RBC**:¬†""While we believe Roku‚Äôs Ad platform is facing headwinds due to its considerable exposure to Brand advertising spend and its reliance on verticals like Casual Dining, Travel & Tourism, we are struck by the fact that ROKU just printed approx. 50% Y/Y Ad Revenue growth in (hopefully) the most COVID-impacted quarter. That will almost certainly be the strongest Q2 growth among the ‚ÄòNet Ad Platforms, in our view. Roku is benefitting from the Small Numbers Law, but it is also fully exposed to arguably the fastest growing Ad Vertical today ‚Äì OTT/CTV. The market was displeased with ROKU‚Äôs lack of Q3 commentary, but the company did specifically state that one its most important Ad Revenue drivers ‚Äì Active Users ‚Äì was growing strongly QTD. We also view the decision to retain ‚ÄúSeattle‚Äù Steve Louden as CFO as a positive sign. ROKU remains one of our Top SMID Cap Longs.""

**DA Davidson**:¬†""Consider company's announcement that CFO Steve Louden was not leaving Roku as the most significant one for the quarter, as we hold him in high esteem...Despite MAGNA's expectation of U.S. digital advertising is expected to decline 5% Y/Y, Roku posted impressive growth, while operating a historically cyclical business model through the pandemic. Monetized video ad impressions grew approximately 50% in the second quarter, as Roku continues to see the benefits of its in-house DSP, dataxu. While the company did not provide any cadence of sales trends in the second quarter or July, we suspect, based on other companies that have reported (Pinterest and Quotient Technology) that monthly sequential advertising demand is increasing, with more advertisers ‚Äúturning back on‚Äù ad impressions.""

**Needham**:¬†""Roku's most important upside value driver in 2Q (our view) was its ecosytem growth at 3.2mm new adds, reaching 43mm Active Accounts (ie, 50% of US Connected TV homes) at 6/30/20. Plus Roku sold an additional 3mm sticks to existing Roku homes which raises LTV because more ads are viewable on additional TVs inside a home. We also liked ROKU's revenue stream diversification in 2Q20, especially its doubling q/q of recurring revenue from SVOD sign ups and TVOD revenue. Risk falls as revenue diversification rises, and/or revs become more predictable. We raise our estimates and PT based on valuation multiple upside as Roku's revenue mix becomes more predictable and diversifies.""

**Oppenheimer**:¬†""We increase our PT to $185 (was $140) and maintain our Outperform as 2Q results topped Street expectations on better than anticipated Platform results and comp valuations have expanded. Platform revenue/gross profit exceeded Street by 11%/12%, with platform revenue +31%E Ex. dataxu on stronger video ad sales, with new clients +40% y/y. While management isn't providing guidance, it sees strong July player sales, and highlighted returning sports as a catalyst for VMPD subscription revenue to rebound. Easier 3Q licensing revenue comps and expanding relationship with key OEM partner TCL to international markets should reduce investor concerns. Full launch and adoption of OneView Ad Platform could prove upside to 4Q/2021.""

**The bears**:

**Morgan Stanley**:¬†""2Q results were broadly in-line, with strong consumer adoption driving account growth and player sales, but a sequential deceleration in Platform revenue growth due to the broader advertising environment. A premium valuation, rising ecosystem tensions, and below consensus '21 estimates leave us UW.""

**Pivotal**: ""ROKU beat our 2Q expectations (which were published May 7th and did not factor in the clear improvement in the pace of advertising declines in June + the massive NFLX (BUY) subscriber beat). ROKU reasonably did not provide any guidance for the balance of ‚Äô20 given uncertainty in the advertising environment but talked about relatively ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù advertising results. During 2Q, ROKU management intelligently took advantage of the clearly rich valuation as they disclosed, an effective $350M equity secondary offering at the market price at the time. ROKU also re-stated its streaming hours downward materially based on a mismeasurement that it said it has corrected.""",2020-08-06,33,9

From what i understand ROKU has a set of OTT hardware (dongles, set top boxes and tv sets) with their own software, and some licensed content streaming through channels which are accessible through their hardware - is this correct so far or did i misunderstand/forget anything?

what i do not understand: what is their moat? in my understanding this is pretty similar to offerings from apple, google and amazon, no? also, pretty much every tv set sold in the last ten years has been connectable, why would one need additional hardware in the future ,unless they have a very old tv set? ROKUs content seems to not be exclusive, so that does not sound like an advantage vs competition either?

gwx928_MA,MA,DD on Roku,"Let's get to it.

Fundamentals and valuation: 

* They don't make money (no earnings, no PE) 
* Negative profit margin, negative operation margin
* Negative return on assets, negative return on equity
* Earnings per share growth is way below industry average 
* Revenue growth is above industry averages but should slow down as the economy re-opens. 
* Their interest coverage ratio is at -63.92x which means they don't earn enough from day-to-day operations to service their debt (although you can argue they do have decent cash flow to satisfy current obligations)

Recent news:

* Recent news of TCL's android-powered smart television coming to Best-Buy had shares continuing to fall
* HBO Max streaming service was NOT distributed on ROKU
* Target price recently downgraded from $155 to $105

Technicals:

* Price below 200 and 50 MA
* MAC D line still below signal line and descending past the zero line on the histogram on the daily chart - bearish signal
* Chaikin oscillator shows downtrend below the zero line - bearish signal
* RSI sitting at 40 but continuing to trend down on the daily chart
* On the volume profile, the price is starting to breach the low volume area of the 100-102 range
* If it breaks the next next pivot point at 98, the stock could perhaps retest the March lows as there's not much support from the volume profile standpoint

IMO it seem Roku makes the most sense, they already have TV's and streaming devices widely spread, they don't have their own in house content and generally have good relationships with the other streaming services. I'm curious if there are any other companies in a better position to dominate this market.

Obviously Amazon, Apple and Google all have their own streaming TV's & devices however Amazon and Apple already having their own streaming services which makes the bundle a bit awkward.

The Cable companies could be another option, though I don't know if that would be a realistic pivot for them as a lot of there streaming technology seems to be a bit clunky.

f2dia4_ROKU,ROKU,ROKU Beats,"A lot of you seem to be confused on what the fuck ROKU's business model actual is. THEY ARE NOT A HARDWARE COMPANY. ROKU is in the Ad business building a *big, next-generation‚Äô targeted ad platform.*

As more and more people cut the cable, they will have to turn to ROKU's platform, or should I say 'ecosystems' to stream their favorite cable channels and networks. ROKU will take a % of this and be one of the largest in America, since anyone, anywhere with an internet connection can use roku to stream TV. The primary competitor is not other services on the platform, the primary competitor is linear tv - and ROKU has them beat.

**Let's look at some numbers:**

* Roku sells more dedicated streaming devices than perhaps any other company in the world. It‚Äôs been estimated that there are more Rokus in US households than there are Fire TVs, Chromecasts, or Apple TVs. Estimates say 40% of all TV's sold are Roku TV's. 
* If you read through [ROKUs dev SDK](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/advertising/roku-advertising-framework.md), you'll see they force their channel partners to use *their* ads taking a cut of all profits and subs made by, FOX, Disney+ etc.
   * *Entertainment firms pay a carriage fee to be on the cable lineup.* Roku has built itself up as an advertising company, getting a cut of the ad revenues from major media partners in exchange for the distribution. 
   * **Roku's 2019 revenues**, **67% of Roku's $1.1 billion in revenues came from ads**. Growing to $1.6 billion in 2020, with the bulk coming¬†from advertising again.¬†Which amounts to the revenue base more than doubling (111% projected growth rate between 2018-2020.
* ROKU's CEO went into a [Mexican standoff with FOX](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/4623654002) and fucking wonn. The guy has balls, ROKU got the superbowl and cucked FOX.

**Guidance:**

* Millions more to cut their 'cable' in 2020 and pick it back up on ROKU enabled devices and TV's
* ROKU will announce (soon) something with COMCAST 
* 1/2 of Disney subs signed up using Roku 
* Super Bowl

&amp;gt; The Roku Channel, and its television operating system, is by far the company's most profitable business. In the third quarter, platform revenue grew to $179 million, up 79% year over year and accelerating from 74% growth in the prior-year quarter. At the same time, it's the most profitable, with gross profit margins of nearly 63%. It's little wonder Roku would be eager to expand this business.

I think this is a game-changing acquisition.....algos went whack, under appreciated as of today....that will change quickly. 

Amazon and Trade Desk should be worried about them acquiring DataXu. Jeff Bezos definitely does not like shaking hands on an agreement with a partner that eventually agrees to be bought out by his rival.

And now Roku owns them.....

Oh and also last week Roku added support for an Apple TV app. 

It‚Äôs unlikely knowing Apple‚Äòs track record that it will enable a Apple TV app on their streaming competitors platform (Amazon Fire)

I now or soonish is a great time to get in, but do your homework and challenge me. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something 

They have the largest market share already.

Now what do you think will happen to apples market share now that Roku has Apple TV support? Exactly. 

The Roku app are built into 33% most smart TVs and that doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing.

For  the quarter, the company expects revenues between $250 million and $255  million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged  at $258.1 million, which indicates growth of 48.8% from the figure  reported in the year-ago quarter.

Further, the consensus mark for third-quarter loss has been steady at 28 cents over the past 30 days.

The  company‚Äôs earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing  four quarters, delivering average positive surprise of 76.7%.

djbmvm_ROKU,ROKU,"Calls ROKU, Puts BYND, Calls China","ROKU - As my post from yesterday suggested, ROKU is in its bullish cycle again.

The green run might continue for another day or two before another 4-5 dollar pull back and another green run. $135/$140/$145 Calls 10/25. Hesistant about running this into ER but we shall see. Analyst upgrades are a good sign as well as the Apple TV integration.

BYND - This overly pumped fake meat company should have been dead at the start of its IPO. -23% bleed in the last month looks great for the bear. This bearish sentiment will continue to drive the stock downhill with increased competition. BYND has no novelty or special product whatsoever => competition is not a good thing for them.

Calls on China, mainly BABA, JD, and Tencent. GDP release will probably not have any direct effect, but bullish sentiments will likely drive these stocks up a couple percent.

ditq82_WDAY,WDAY,"ROKU, AMD, PCG, and WDAY are the plays.","Calls on all.

Roku - Integration of Apple TV is a great addition to compete with Amazon Video, Netflix, and Disney. Roku on it's own is a cat - never dies, always recovers, and always makes you shake your head when you miss out on the pumps. Historically, if you look at ROKU, big green days generally run for about 3 days before it subsides and another pump follows.

AMD - They have earnings coming up soon. Last ER, both Lisa and Devinder were confident on positive cash flow. With the new lineup that was released this year, the numbers should look nice. Especially with holiday seasons coming, the next quarter will be even more exciting for those holding far out calls.

PCG - Well, they are in a shithole. But, the company has everything under control. I hear people talking about bankruptcy without understanding the function of it and how common it is for a company to do this. PCG is fundamentally okay. Gov. Newsom wanted to list the company for buyout and PCG refused the offer, arguing that they will be cover by year's end.

WDAY - Overly bearish sentiments by analyst that really had nothing to say other than the delays. Yes, delays are not great for business, but -11% for an expected lower revenue? LOL come on.",2019-10-16,30,28

Roku seems to have great 4th quarters, possibly because they make lots of sales for Christmas.

4th quarter earnings reports for Roku will be coming out Feb 21st. I have a gut feeling they just might have a phenomenal 4th quarter, partly due to the rising popularity of Netflix and their exclusives.

Apparently, Roku has many partnerships with retailers for smart TVs. Amazon does partner with Best Buy for their Fire TV devices, but Roku is still a dominant player in the smart TV market, although Amazon is quickly catching up. From my research I believe Amazon holds about 20% of the smart TV market, and Roku holds 25%.

Ultimately, it seems Amazon is a very formidable competitor, for many reasons, although in the short term, I think Roku will maintain some momentum.",2019-02-04,8,29

As it stands the company is still losing money and the revenue generated from the ROKU channel while increasing is still very small. However I'm looking at and considering the potential here .

&#x200B;

Given the Amazon, google, Apple, and countless others have been trying to take over the space for years now, yet ROKU remains one of if not the dominant player, I will assume that over the next few years their growth will continue. Sure this could change, but with cable providers starting to recommend ROKU devices as the player for their apps, integration in more and more TV, and newer dongle devices, all while re entering Mexico and other huge markets, I don't think this will change

&#x200B;

ROKU's focus seems to be on becoming the default OS/player for anything and everything OTT and leveraging this for advertising and subscription revenue. So far I consider their ROKU Channel to be a proof of concept, that they can successfully target ads, and create a viable revenue stream to grow the business and become profitable. It's very much still in it's infancy, but, the company has started to show hints of where it is heading next.

From what I've read, ROKU is working on switching to a home screen focused more on content vs. channels. At first this may seem counter intuitive, however, I think it's the right move. By doing this, ROKU 

* Creates an opportunity to charge content providers / producers to feature their content
* Providers more opportunity for advertising through the whole interface vs. just the ROKU channel 
* Turns ROKU into the hub for all to existing and upcoming OTT services.  (which is critical as more and more services are launched which will start to fatigue users if they have to go in individual apps for content or manage subscriptions. ROKU is hinting at centralizing this and acting a presentation layer for all content)
* Will hopefully improve the overall user experience thus driving further engagement

If or when ROKU gets to the stage where their advertising platform is as robust and effective as Google or Facebook's, but sits on your television, coupled with an active userbase of 50mln subscribers, the advertising and subscription revenue potential will be tremendous.

May 10, 2018 10:51 AM ET|About: Roku Inc. (ROKU)|By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor 
Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is up 2.5% after a solid beat in its Q1 earnings along with a raised full-year outlook and praise coming in from analysts.

Citi raised its price target to $40 from $36 while staying Neutral.

One of the company's biggest champions, Needham's Laura Martin, notes the company ""over-delivered its guidance (again)"" and points to expanding gross margins, strong ads and record ARPU: ""NFLX is the best comp to Roku, and Roku sells at half its valuation."" She has a $50 price target, implying 35% upside from today's higher price.

Meanwhile, RBC's Mark Mahaney channeled the late Michael Jackson: ""I want to ROK w/U ... all night."" He says fundamentals are ""very strong"" and the company's still attacking a $70B TV ad spend opportunity; he rates it Sector Perform with a price target of $45. (h/t Bloomberg)",2018-05-10,7,13
8hvuz7_ROKU,ROKU,"Your thoughts on bearish credit call spreads for ROKU and BCS? Also, how do you decide on the spread between legs?","I've been watching ROKU for quite a while now and it seems to be spending most of its time well below the $35 mark. My noob understanding of options is that if I sold calls on this underlying for the 35 SP, one that expires in July, they would likely expire worthless and I would get to keep the premium, minus whatever I paid for the upper leg that I would be hedging with. 

Similarly with BCS, if I feel that it is unlikely to poke its head above $12 or at the most $13 any time soon, it seems to make sense to me to sell a call on it at that SP with an XP of July and buy another higher call as a hedge. 

What I don't quite follow for these types of spreads is how people decide on the strike price for their bought legs. How do you decide how far apart you want these legs? And what do you think of these two underlyings as the basis for my spreads?

Thank you, and may you all have a very nice day.",2018-05-08,3,11

Since then I had almost forgotten about Roku, until I heard the mention of the IPO, because I have a smart TV, Android box and PlayStation. So with so many products that do everything a Roku can do, plus more, what is Roku working on to become unique and needed once again. I was willing to buy shares today but couldn't bring myself to hold them because I don't know what is in the future for Roku. I have heard they are making smart speakers but nothing that seems to have any real substance, besides, it has already been done. If anyone has any info please share, it would be nice to know.
