1k5f4pv_RTX,RTX,RTX wild price swings.,"This can’t be just DOGE cuts. Can someone help me understand these swings? 

1. Geopolitical Events

RTX is one of the largest defense contractors in the world. When global tensions rise — wars, military conflicts (like in Ukraine or the Middle East), or increased defense spending — investors often flock to defense stocks like RTX. This can cause big upward movements in its price.

Example: When the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, many defense companies saw a jump in share prices due to anticipated higher demand for military equipment.

⸻

2. Government Contracts & Budgets

The U.S. government is RTX’s biggest customer. Changes in the defense budget, new contracts, or delays in government spending can have a big effect on stock price.

Uptrend: Awarded a multi-billion dollar defense contract.
Downtrend: Budget cuts or canceled projects.

⸻

3. Mergers & Spin-Offs

RTX was formed from a merger between Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corporation in 2020. That kind of corporate restructuring — and later spin-offs or acquisitions — can create large volatility.

Recent example: In 2023, RTX announced a major business reorganization and separated into three business units, which impacted how investors viewed its long-term potential.

⸻

4. Product/Technical Issues

Big companies like RTX work on complex technologies — aircraft engines, missiles, radar systems. Any failure, recall, or defect can massively impact investor confidence.

Example: In 2023, a major issue was found in Pratt & Whitney jet engines, one of RTX’s key divisions. That led to a sharp drop in stock due to costs related to engine inspections and repairs.

⸻

5. Broader Market Sentiment

Sometimes, RTX follows the broader market trends — especially if interest rates, inflation, or tech cycles change how investors value big industrial stocks.

⸻

6. Earnings Reports

Like most public companies, RTX’s stock often reacts strongly to quarterly earnings reports. Surprises (good or bad) related to revenue, profit, or future guidance can create large swings.

⸻

If you’re curious, I can show you a chart of some of these key price trends with notes on the causes — would that help? Or would you rather go deeper into one of the reasons above, like the engine problems or the merger stuff?",2025-04-22,2,3

I have with LMT and RTX two US defense contractors in my portfolio. With the latest news from the Ukraine war I am concerned that their revenue will be hurt badly because the US president decided to limit the range of HIMARS.

I am sure that a lot of countries will take this into consideration that if you are ordering modern US weapons you are at mercy of the US president.
Maybe some countries will reevaluate their existing orders as well. E.g. Poland ordered 486 HIMARS. 

On the other side the existing F35 orders should be pretty safe because there isn’t an European stealth fighter jet available right now. But selling more of these, at least to European countries, should be hard.

The US plan to decrease the defense budget also isn’t helping both stocks.

But at the end, RTX should have enough civilian exposure in my opinion.

1istr3e_RTX,RTX,Nvidia overestimated demand for GB200 chips in data centers. Excess 4nm process production capacity will be used to re-produce RTX 50 series,"[Translated from this Chinese article](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20250218701584-430503):

2025.02.18  17:20  China  Times: AI chip leader Nvidia launched the RTX 50 series graphics cards at the end of January. Currently, only the RTX 5090 and 5080 are sold in the channel. However, the first batch of distribution is limited, so the offline market price has soared by 3 times. Foreign media pointed out that Nvidia overestimated the demand for GB200 chips in data centers, and the excess 4nm process production capacity will be used to re-produce RTX 50 series graphics cards.

Nvidia's RTX 5090 graphics card was officially launched in Taiwan at the end of January, but the first batch of production capacity is limited, so the current offline transaction price has soared from the original list price of 71,990 yuan to a maximum of 220,000 yuan. Distributors privately revealed that only Taiwanese players with plenty of money would offer such a price to purchase the graphics card, otherwise the graphics cards that are resold at high prices are all purchased by mainland businesses or players commissioned by Taiwanese people.

According to foreign media reports, the demand for Nvidia's GB200 chips used in data centers is far lower than expected. Therefore, TSMC's excess production capacity is currently allocated to the production of GB202 chips required for the RTX 5090. The shortage of graphics cards is expected to end within 1 month.

1eja9ta_LMT,LMT,Mideast instability going to enter the chat this week $LMT $RTX $MRO $OXY $HES,"TL;DR: Israel went too far assassinating a Hamas political chief in Iran in response to the rocket strike in the Golan Heights recently. Iran is going to have to do something fairly big in response in an attempt to keep Israel in check. Resulting instability, escalation, and Russian interest in causing regional chaos could send oil stocks up as shipping through the Straight of Hormuz could be complicated by Iran if there is broad escalation.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Longer version (may edit later to add more sources)

Things are escalating the Mid East. Israel responded to a Hezbollah rocket attack that killed a bunch of kids at a soccer game by assassinating 2 guys. The guy who launched the rockets in Beirut (alone prolly nbd) and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas political chief (bfd). Haniyeh was killed in Iran's capital. Assassinating foreign leaders openly is a big deal. Doing it in rival nations capitals is a bigger deal. And what it means is that Iran is now in a position where they *have* to respond.

Israel needed to thread the needle with their response to Hezbollah to hit the off-ramp. Hardliners were not going to allow a response that was too mild with the awful nature of what happened in the Golan Heights. But international actors were desperately trying to prevent a response that went too far so as to avoid broader conflagration.

International diplomacy failed and Israel went too far. They assassinated the leader of an organization that didn't do the attack in the capital of a foreign rival.

The US is moving military assets to the ME now to protect Israel from a likely Iranian response. Although Iran's response to one of their Generals being killed in April didn't do much damage, they are in a realpolitik position of having to punish Israel for this, lest they grant carte blanche authority for Israel to start decapitating leadership of rival political groups throughout the region with impunity. This is an extraordinary action that Iran cannot afford to rubber stamp with inaction.

Iran and its allied proxies run the distinct risk of escalating conflict in the region by being *too soft* in their response.

The final kicker here and the elephant in the room is Russia, Iran's closest and most powerful ally. Russia has an extraordinary set of incentives for Trump to beat Harris in November, the most obvious being complicating US funding for Ukrainian defense (there's a whole lot more there but that's one of the most immediate benefits for Russia).

With Harris taking over for Biden's doomed effort, the political calculus has shifted for Putin. A broader regional war in the ME is bad for an incumbent presidency by itself. That causing already teetering markets to collapse further is also terrible for Harris. And on top of that, [gas prices ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Wohar/publication/24076097_Do_increases_in_petroleum_product_prices_put_the_incumbent_party_at_risk_in_US_presidential_elections/links/54f467fb0cf24eb8794e6abf/Do-increases-in-petroleum-product-prices-put-the-incumbent-party-at-risk-in-US-presidential-elections.pdf)have a lot of influence on election cycles.

Russia may believe that a middle east war will produce a Trump victory and that otherwise, those odds are growing longer by the day. With markets on the ropes, Russia may believe prompting an large Iranian response now could be a tipping point.

And if Iran believes that they cannot afford a weak response, their best means of reprisal would be having their proxies attack Israel so the Houti's in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and what's left of Hamas in Gaza.

How to play it:

HES, OXY, MRO - The Straight of Hormuz is the concern. If Iran wants, they can shut it down or at a minimum make passage very difficult. That means oil companies with less production in the ME have the most to gain. After 10/7 when there was a perceived risk that Iran would complicate the straight, all 3 of these jumped over the week following. Plus the options are pretty cheap. Depending on how this is developing Monday, I'll probably buy some MRO $28c 8/23 (currently about .55). I don't trade a lot of oil stocks so any feedback welcome on these companies. One other upside is that they all appear to be oversold currently.

EDIT: Its true that these three don't move very fast but the premiums reflect that. Needless to say, its certainly not a play you want to make very far OTM if at all, imo. Commentor [La\_Menace\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/La_Menace_/) also pointed out the risk that if the gains for these companies are modest, economic chaos may swallow any gains they make because of Hormuz stuff. For me, the premiums are cheap enough that it could be a reasonable lotto play but certainly to each their own on this.

EDIT: [CultureForsaken3762](https://www.reddit.com/user/CultureForsaken3762/) Says XOP is the play, more correlation with oil prices. Ty

LMT, RTX, defense etfs - appears as though these companies have been on a run but they could go further if things escalate. Again, any input on these/defense stocks that could run is welcome, don't typically trade them.

DRS too? Comment below reads:

""Solid DD but missing DRS when talking about defense stocks in this region shows you could’ve gone deeper. It will fly in the near future"". Certainly worth a look ty!

ZIM - someone mentioned this the other day and it did go up at the Golan attack. However, look at its chart after 10/7 before you make the call on that, it actually went down (iirc) a few days after.

Index Puts - I mean who doesn't have these right now?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Just gonna put a couple other notes about things down here but you don't need to read this part unless you hate yourself and your spare time.

1. De-escalation scenario - the window is narrower than post-golan imo. The reason is because doing very little to nothing effectual in response is now by itself a cause for escalation because it invites more assassinations and attack by Israel. Plus with Russia potentially wanting war, there is no voice in the room for Iran that is discouraging attacks. I'm having trouble seeing an Iranian response that delivers a pound of flesh
2. Nuclear things - I don't see a strong risk of a nuclear response any time in the near future but if tensions escalate and international actors get drawn-in, the more likely nuclear thing that could escalate things is declaration by either Iran or Israel. Iran cause they finished thier first bomb. Israel could abandon long-standing nuclear opacity as a flex.
3. The Tehran assassination - as details emerge, it could influence the response. If it was just a drone through a window, that's one thing. But if some of these reports that Iranian security helped plant the bomb and it was there for month are true, it means Iran needs to be a lot more worried because they are compromised af.
4. Already escalating - been checking in on the news as I write this. Israel is stepping up attacks on South Lebanon, they blew up a school today, they killed another vip in the West Bank today, Yemen may have just taken a shot at a ship from the UK.
5. Biden may have lost his ability to influence Bibi- it seemed to me like the assassination of the commanding officer that launched the Golan missiles was a smart off-ramp attack. I wouldn't be surprised if that killing was negotiated through backchannel (Hez might have even given him up thinking it would avoid an escalation). But it seems like Biden had no idea Israel was planning to pop the Hamas political chief in Tehran. If that's the case, it means Israel is giving in to hardliners internally and shutting-out the 'cooler heads'.  Even worse they may be faking willingness to agree to a truce to buy more time. Article about that:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations)

6. Hope I'm wrong about things escalating, there's enough dead kids in Gaza already, I'm by no means rooting for Israel to open-up on Lebanon. But I think given recent events, its worth keeping an eye on.

EDIT/UPDATE: This is looking quite bad. The Biden Admin has no control over what Netanyahu is doing now. They can't stop them and its become evident that Bibi has been bullshitting Biden about the cease fire in Gaza. Bibi fired Gallant, a bad sign when things are taking a turn for the crazy aggressive (e.g. assassinating foreign leaders). 

Reports are coming out that Iran could attack [within the next 48 hours](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/iran-hezbollah-attack-israel-monday-blinken). No way to know if that's true. Could also just be Israel hyping the threat to make the case for preemption.

Israeli sources are reporting that Israel could [preemptively strike Iran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-could-preemptively-strike-iran-if-intelligence-shows-attack-is-imminent-report/) if they felt an attack was imminent. What's interesting and worrisome about those reports is that they seem more like Israel priming the narrative for why preemption was the only option. They're setting a low bar for ""knowing the attack is imminent"" as its pretty widely recognized that Iran plans to attack somehow.

Finally, the reason why escalation might be right around the corner is that most parties involved now want it and benefit from it. Putin because war, economic recession (at least correction), and sky-high gas prices are a good formula for getting Trump elected. Iran because their hardliners are losing their minds because of the assassination. And finally Netanyahu also has an inventive to go to war now because he too would want to influence the US election. He's proactively been making the Biden admin look like shit on this one and he knows that a massive war in the ME is going to devastate Harris' chances in November. He'd rather have trump in office so he knows he can continue with this wild-west style war mongering and the US won't stop him, not even a little. Harris, on the other hand, is faced with a catch-22 if war escalates: Condition or withdraw support for Israel in the conflict and suffer the wrath of AIPAC before the election. Or support the war and lose the youth/progressive vote because Harris is the veep who's signing-off on selling bombs to a country that will kill kids with them.

1eja9ta_DE,DE,Mideast instability going to enter the chat this week $LMT $RTX $MRO $OXY $HES,"TL;DR: Israel went too far assassinating a Hamas political chief in Iran in response to the rocket strike in the Golan Heights recently. Iran is going to have to do something fairly big in response in an attempt to keep Israel in check. Resulting instability, escalation, and Russian interest in causing regional chaos could send oil stocks up as shipping through the Straight of Hormuz could be complicated by Iran if there is broad escalation. Defense stocks could also pump. HES MRO and OXY look like more attractive plays rn given recent price action. And of course, if things escalate quickly, spy/qqq puts should continue to print. NFA

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Longer version (may edit later to add more sources)

Things are escalating the Mid East. Israel responded to a Hezbollah rocket attack that killed a bunch of kids at a soccer game by assassinating 2 guys. The guy who launched the rockets in Beirut (alone prolly nbd) and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas political chief (bfd). Haniyeh was killed in Iran's capital. Assassinating foreign leaders openly is a big deal. Doing it in rival nations capitals is a bigger deal. And what it means is that Iran is now in a position where they *have* to respond.

Israel needed to thread the needle with their response to Hezbollah to hit the off-ramp. Hardliners were not going to allow a response that was too mild with the awful nature of what happened in the Golan Heights. But international actors were desperately trying to prevent a response that went too far so as to avoid broader conflagration.

International diplomacy failed and Israel went too far. They assassinated the leader of an organization that didn't do the attack in the capital of a foreign rival.

The US is moving military assets to the ME now to protect Israel from a likely Iranian response. Although Iran's response to one of their Generals being killed in April didn't do much damage, they are in a realpolitik position of having to punish Israel for this, lest they grant carte blanche authority for Israel to start decapitating leadership of rival political groups throughout the region with impunity. This is an extraordinary action that Iran cannot afford to rubber stamp with inaction.

Iran and its allied proxies run the distinct risk of escalating conflict in the region by being *too soft* in their response.

The final kicker here and the elephant in the room is Russia, Iran's closest and most powerful ally. Russia has an extraordinary set of incentives for Trump to beat Harris in November, the most obvious being complicating US funding for Ukrainian defense (there's a whole lot more there but that's one of the most immediate benefits for Russia).

With Harris taking over for Biden's doomed effort, the political calculus has shifted for Putin. A broader regional war in the ME is bad for an incumbent presidency by itself. That causing already teetering markets to collapse further is also terrible for Harris. And on top of that, [gas prices ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Wohar/publication/24076097_Do_increases_in_petroleum_product_prices_put_the_incumbent_party_at_risk_in_US_presidential_elections/links/54f467fb0cf24eb8794e6abf/Do-increases-in-petroleum-product-prices-put-the-incumbent-party-at-risk-in-US-presidential-elections.pdf)have a lot of influence on election cycles.

Russia may believe that a middle east war will produce a Trump victory and that otherwise, those odds are growing longer by the day. With markets on the ropes, Russia may believe prompting an large Iranian response now could be a tipping point.

And if Iran believes that they cannot afford a weak response, their best means of reprisal would be having their proxies attack Israel so the Houti's in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and what's left of Hamas in Gaza.

How to play it:

HES, OXY, MRO - The Straight of Hormuz is the concern. If Iran wants, they can shut it down or at a minimum make passage very difficult. That means oil companies with less production in the ME have the most to gain. After 10/7 when there was a perceived risk that Iran would complicate the straight, all 3 of these jumped over the week following. Plus the options are pretty cheap. Depending on how this is developing Monday, I'll probably buy some MRO $28c 8/23 (currently about .55). I don't trade a lot of oil stocks so any feedback welcome on these companies. One other upside is that they all appear to be oversold currently.

EDIT: Its true that these three don't move very fast but the premiums reflect that. Needless to say, its certainly not a play you want to make very far OTM if at all, imo. Commentor [La\_Menace\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/La_Menace_/) also pointed out the risk that if the gains for these companies are modest, economic chaos may swallow any gains they make because of Hormuz stuff. For me, the premiums are cheap enough that it could be a reasonable lotto play but certainly to each their own on this.

EDIT: [CultureForsaken3762](https://www.reddit.com/user/CultureForsaken3762/) Says XOP is the play, more correlation with oil prices. Ty

LMT, RTX, defense etfs - appears as though these companies have been on a run but they could go further if things escalate. Again, any input on these/defense stocks that could run is welcome, don't typically trade them.

DRS too? Comment below reads:

""Solid DD but missing DRS when talking about defense stocks in this region shows you could’ve gone deeper. It will fly in the near future"". Certainly worth a look ty!

ZIM - someone mentioned this the other day and it did go up at the Golan attack. However, look at its chart after 10/7 before you make the call on that, it actually went down (iirc) a few days after.

Index Puts - I mean who doesn't have these right now?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Just gonna put a couple other notes about things down here but you don't need to read this part unless you hate yourself and your spare time.

1. De-escalation scenario - the window is narrower than post-golan imo. The reason is because doing very little to nothing effectual in response is now by itself a cause for escalation because it invites more assassinations and attack by Israel. Plus with Russia potentially wanting war, there is no voice in the room for Iran that is discouraging attacks. I'm having trouble seeing an Iranian response that delivers a pound of flesh
2. Nuclear things - I don't see a strong risk of a nuclear response any time in the near future but if tensions escalate and international actors get drawn-in, the more likely nuclear thing that could escalate things is declaration by either Iran or Israel. Iran cause they finished thier first bomb. Israel could abandon long-standing nuclear opacity as a flex.
3. The Tehran assassination - as details emerge, it could influence the response. If it was just a drone through a window, that's one thing. But if some of these reports that Iranian security helped plant the bomb and it was there for month are true, it means Iran needs to be a lot more worried because they are compromised af.
4. Already escalating - been checking in on the news as I write this. Israel is stepping up attacks on South Lebanon, they blew up a school today, they killed another vip in the West Bank today, Yemen may have just taken a shot at a ship from the UK.
5. Biden may have lost his ability to influence Bibi- it seemed to me like the assassination of the commanding officer that launched the Golan missiles was a smart off-ramp attack. I wouldn't be surprised if that killing was negotiated through backchannel (Hez might have even given him up thinking it would avoid an escalation). But it seems like Biden had no idea Israel was planning to pop the Hamas political chief in Tehran. If that's the case, it means Israel is giving in to hardliners internally and shutting-out the 'cooler heads'.  Even worse they may be faking willingness to agree to a truce to buy more time. Article about that:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations)

6. Hope I'm wrong about things escalating, there's enough dead kids in Gaza already, I'm by no means rooting for Israel to open-up on Lebanon. But I think given recent events, its worth keeping an eye on.

EDIT/UPDATE: This is looking quite bad. The Biden Admin has no control over what Netanyahu is doing now. They can't stop them and its become evident that Bibi has been bullshitting Biden about the cease fire in Gaza. Bibi fired Gallant, a bad sign when things are taking a turn for the crazy aggressive (e.g. assassinating foreign leaders). 

Reports are coming out that Iran could attack [within the next 48 hours](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/iran-hezbollah-attack-israel-monday-blinken). No way to know if that's true. Could also just be Israel hyping the threat to make the case for preemption.

The company was formed in April 2020 through the merger of Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corporation.

Strong operating cash flow growth. Really the main metric in focusing in on. But the rest of the balance sheet is strong as well as growth in operating income. Obvious Top and bottom line numbers have been growing higher in comparison to the industry. Company relies on government contracts which is a risk, but with Ukraine/Russian war this continues to grow even with a democrat in office. If a republican gets elected I expect no issue with consistency in contract revenue. Good yield on dividend.

GamersNexus came to same conclusion independently.,"There have been a lot of users claiming Nvidia is going to tank when a class action forces a huge recall because their cards are melting. There is mounting evidence that the claims are unfounded because it is just users not plugging the power connector in all the way.

I figured this would cause a good bump in the price as many have been acting on the assumption that this was a big issue lying in wait out there.

Their current fair value is $415 and the sit at $350 they pay some of the highest dividends on the market as well at 3%. Not to mention Biden will keep dropping bombs and the company is essentially the research and development arm of our military and the very definition of too big to fail (74% of business is US) not only due to their size but because of the extremely sensitive national security secrets they possess (if aliens are real these are the people reverse engineering their craft). They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile manufacturers. They will make the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold. Until the US decides to go a year without increasing the defense budget, the country goes bankrupt, or world peace suddenly breaks out. I'd take this over a savings accnt anyday.

koosgm_RTX,RTX,RTX adjusted options,"[https://puu.sh/H2Yhl/dac038a090.png](https://puu.sh/H2Yhl/dac038a090.png)

So I just came across this option chain and the price attracted my attention. There are 4 different rows for jan 15, one of which is regular and the other 3 are adjusted. As you can see the premium for the normal row is what you'd expect, but the premium for the adjusted one is 40x more. Could someone tell me how selling covered calls on this, way far OTM is not a ton of free money? I was thinking of selling a single 95 covered call for 4265$. From what I understand, in order to have a covered call, I need to buy 100 RTX shares, 50 OTIS shares and 100 CARR shares, which becomes

100\*71.51 + 50\*67.55 + 100\*37.72 = 14300.50$

I can only imagine the following possibilities:

1. Option expires worthless, as in, RTX trades below 95 by jan 15. In that case I keep the premium 4265$ and my 250 shares in those 3 companies. Right?
2. Option expires in the money (very low chance RTX rises 35% in less than 2 weeks but who knows, so let's cover this case too). Now could someone explain what the hell happens here exactly? I guess my 100 RTX shares would be sold at 95$, but the shares in the other 2 companies would be given away for free right? If that's the case, I'd end up with: 100\*95 + 4265-50\*67.55-100\*37.72 = 6615.50$

THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, SO WHAT AM I MISSING?! I did check level 2 on those options and there is indeed demand for both buying and selling at around the price shown in the pic.

This is the first time I hear about adjusted options, all I know is that everyone recommends to not trade them because they're illiquid and have big wide spreads. But how is selling way OTM not free money?  The biggest argument against selling ridiculously OTM options is collecting pennies on the dollar, but in this case it would be like collecting dollars on the pennies.

For the record, I'm sure it's not free money, otherwise everyone would do it. I'd just like to understand why. I've posted this on wsb and thetagang already, but nobody there could provide  an answer so I'm hoping someone here can.",2021-01-02,1,3

jywvvi_GE,GE,"Unusual Option Activity Summary for the week: GE, LB, TEAM, RTX, USFD, FANG, HALO, YETI","Swaggy is back with some unusual options activity that was spotted last week. We’ll be looking into some of the plays that happened and what the player is expecting.

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

&#x200B;

**USFD - US Foods Holding Group**

https://preview.redd.it/giioup9t1t061.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c3c2335776dd8c2880c6839c80109116e243c8

Some unusual option flow has surfaced in USFD, an unusual ticker to begin with that doesn't generally have much option volume roll through it. Last week we saw some call buying for December 18 expiration at the $35 strike. The stock has been consolidating for some time based on the chart, is it time for a break-out?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**LB - L Brands Inc**

https://preview.redd.it/5vr4fgxt1t061.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=8de6cb0535000ba8c7a1e50fd82bf5f7e319a535

LB shot up last week and saw some heavy bullish option flow come through the tape. Big time call-buying for 2021 expirations, so somewhat mid-term plays here. LB posted good earnings last week and looks like players are looking to ride the momentum to new highs. The stock is up about 20% just last week.

&#x200B;

**TEAM - Atlassian Corp**

https://preview.redd.it/t91i1mgu1t061.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5a165c2df9531c6bddd71022d3b55db750cc44e

Absolutely huge call-buying in 2021 expirations and some 2022 LEAPs. Most strikes were somewhat in-the-money indicating the options contract will act more closely to share price and less of a YOLO. Nonetheless we saw some multi-million dollar positions come through betting that the stock will out-perform in the 6 months to 1 year. Interesting plays here.

&#x200B;

**RTX - Raytheon Tech**

https://preview.redd.it/b04laqz12t061.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=06db43eecfbe6499f7581bf2c5f13200780b9ae4

Another unusual ticker to be receiving such heavy call volume hit the tape. Last week a player bought 16,000 call options expiring in June 2021. The strike price was 20% OTM at the time, this is a pretty FKn big YOLO. I will be following this stock to see what catalysts might come out.

&#x200B;

**YETI - Yeti Holdings**

https://preview.redd.it/nyikkkt22t061.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43990ee4c4b492c4061daa13ed3c7fcafdaa491

Some put-selling came through YETI ticker last week. Multiple positions which included a position of 8k contracts puts SOLD to open. The stock has been on a steady up-trend ever since covid and the player is expecting the trend to continue into the Holiday season. 8,000 puts sold at $50 strike for December 4 expiration. If the stock stay above $50 (currently at $61), the player will collect $450k in premium.

&#x200B;

**FANG - DiamondBack Energy**

https://preview.redd.it/yu1zqww32t061.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=724a51fe870d4adc7768bd02f5ebc45f9faba374

This energy stonk has been beat up since covid hit and hasn't rebounded at all. Looking at the chart it's been in the $25-40 range for 6 months without much growth. Some call buying with mid-term time-frames came through last week in Dec 18 and Mar 19, 2021 expirations. Each play was between 3-5k contract a piece and the $45 strike was the favorite here which is sitting at about 15% OTM. This name has seen some heavy buying into since November and will be interesting to watch.

&#x200B;

**HALO - Halozyme Therapeutics**

https://preview.redd.it/tnoywxd42t061.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=19254d3525347e7507a6fab88b10e6d51af80de5

Halo has shot up 50% just in the last month of trading and has seen some explosive growth.  A ticker that rarely sees even a few hundred contracts come through saw a couple plays in the 1,000s of contracts last week. This is pretty unusual considering the open interest for most strikes and expirations is less than 80-100 per strike. So these plays of over 1,000 contract definitely stand out. Looks like players are betting on the stock to go above $44 by December 18, 2020, a relatively short-term play that would make WSB proud.

&#x200B;

**GE - General Electric**

https://preview.redd.it/p210ui752t061.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ec919f5bea611428d6e5dacea856caa4a77e74e

Last week unusual call buying swept through. With nearly all the plays expiring mid-2021. An absolutely amazing 100k call contracts were traded at the June 18, 2021 expiration and $10 strike. Also looks like 100k put contracts were traded on the Jan 15, 2021 contracts with $8 strike. Tough to say if these plays are related with the same player. Most of the option flow outside those two big plays was leaning to the bullish side.",2020-11-22,305,46
jlmpjo_RTX,RTX,"$LHX, $RTX, $LMT and the Defense Industry DD","**PREFACE:**

&#x200B;

I think this upcoming week will provide a fantastic opportunity to enter an investment into any of the three tickers I listed at a tremendous discount to fair value. 

Election uncertainties and fears of a Biden win have caused the share prices of defense sector stocks plummet despite strong financial results in the most recent round of earnings.

The outlook for the defense budget is actually great. Both Biden and Trump would be **extremely unlikely** to significantly cut the defense budget. Both have formally stated that they would like to maintain a strong military presence to counter the rising threat of China albeit through different strategies. Biden wants more defense spending to be allocated towards cybersecurity/drones while trump wants more conventional options.

&#x200B;

**Dividend Analysis:**

All three of the companies have respectable dividend safety and growth histories. Right now $RTX is the most undervalued due to the headwinds from its acquisition of UTX and the stagnation of revenue streams related to aviation/planes until global air travel recovers.

$LHX has the absolute highest CAGR of \~20% over the past 20 years with a solid 5 year DGR of 10%. 

$LMT is not too far behind $LHX with a 5 year DGR of \~8%

$LMT offers a slightly higher starting yield at \~2.7% compared to $LHX at 2.1% though nowhere nearly as high as $RTX at 3.5%

**Fundamental Analysis:**

$LMT is likely the safest bet here. It has the largest defense backlog and is trading at a lower PE ratio relative to LHX. It also doesn't face the headwinds of exposure to the aviation industry like $RTX.

$LHX offers the biggest potential for future growth. These guys are trading at a large P/E for a reason; they've been experiencing explosive growth and are in drones + cybersecurity services which are likely to boom.

I'm talking about companies like RTX, LMT and NOC. We can assume that they are developing aircraft, weapons systems and tech that we, the public, cannot possibly know about yet for reasons of national security. 

We can also assume that there are already multiple weapons systems that have ALREADY been developed that we have no, or limited knowledge of. We know, for example, that Northrop is developing the B-21 Raider, which will be the new heavy stealth bomber for the USAF. What we know about this aircraft and contract is limited, but NOC will already be earning from this, in the form of funding, before the completion and delivery of said aircraft.

My question is, do these companies report earnings from confidential government contracts & projects in quarterly statements?",2020-07-04,5,3

gfiin0_RTX,RTX,Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX) Breakdown,"Since RTX is currently a hot topic, here's a breakdown on what the company represents. Make sure you know and understand what you are investing in.

**Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX)**

RTX was formed from the merger of United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company.

The company has four subsidiaries:

- Pratt & Whitney - aircraft engines and gas turbines
- Collins Aerospace - aerospace parts and systems for commercial, regional, corporate and military aircraft; also a major supplier for international space programs;
- Raytheon Intelligence & Space - satellite sensors, satellite signal processing, radar, infrared sensors, etc
- Raytheon Missiles & Defense - precision weapons, radars, command and control systems

Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace are the merged portions from UTC. 

UTC spun off Otis Elevator and Carrier Corporation prior to the merger. 

This makes all of RTX's revenue based on aerospace (both civilian/commercial and military) and defense. The intended goal of the merger was to make a more focused business (hence the spin-offs).

**RTX Revenue Stream Breakdown**

- Pratt & Whitney - $20.9 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [P&W Fact Sheet Available Here](https://newsroom.prattwhitney.com/collateral)
- Collins Aerospace - $26 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [Collins Aerospace Fact Sheet](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/-/media/project/collinsaerospace/collinsaerospace-website/newsroom/files/collins_aerospace_fact-sheet.pdf)  
- Raytheon - $27.1 billion net sales (RTN did not file a 2019 annual report) [2018 Annual Report](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/4ef5db84-7cfc-41d0-9081-d22a83542afb)

Collectively:

UTC accounted for $35.2 billion in commercial sales and $11.7 billion in military sales

Raytheon accounted for $27.1 billion in sales

$74 billion altogether, with about 48% being commercial sales 


**Analysis**

Almost half of RTX's sales are related to commercial aircraft. Commercial air travel is obviously almost non-existent right now. Sales for new aircraft (and engines) will be down dramatically for an unknown but extended period of time, and aftermarket repair and maintanence will also be down. A quote on the company's trajectory/recovery from their CEO during today's conference call:

    “It’s not a sharp V,” he said. “It is more like a U shape. I think it’s going to be a full two years before we see a recovery close to what we saw in terms of 2019 levels of aftermarket. That could well be three years.”

Therefore, it looks like the majority of the company's income for the near future will be based on defense contracts. This might explain the recent downtrend in the stock's performance. I personally believe the company is undervalued and is a great long term buy and hold, but it may take several years for the stock to recover. Unlike most of the large defense companies out there, RTX's role in the commercial market gives them a wider range of opportunities than their competitors. Pratt & Whitney's engines are widely regarded as the best on the market, and their placement on new Airbus planes means that they will have long term servicing revenue. Therefore, although they may be the weaker portion of the company in the short term, they should be able to rebound effectively.",2020-05-08,338,115
