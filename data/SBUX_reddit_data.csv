1ky3655_NET,NET,Brian Niccol – Starbucks CEO Analysis,"As part of its leadership overhaul, Starbucks hired a new CFO. Cathy Smith was awarded a $5 million sign-on bonus on top of a base pay of $925,000 per year and $4.5 million in stock incentives. Yet this is nothing compared to the compensation package of their new CEO, Brian Niccol, who was poached from Chipotle by Starbucks to transform the brand and bring success back to the business. The company aims to increase earnings, yet they awarded Niccol a **$96 million dollar compensation package**, making him the highest paid CEO in the company’s history. As one of the highest paid executives in corporate America, [Niccol earned approximately 6,666 times that of its average barista](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf). It is worth pointing out, in regard to that number, that many Starbucks employees work part time. This compensation pack put him above the CEO of Apple, Microsoft, Disney, GE, and more when comparing 2024 CEO annual pay. Apple and Microsoft generated net incomes that were almost *triple* that of Starbucks in 2024, which makes this all the more shocking in my opinion.

**Brian Niccol Starbucks Compensation Package Breakdown:**

* $10 million signing bonus
* $5 million sign on bonus after one month of employment
* $1.6 million annual base salary
* [$418,071 additional compensation benefit ](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf)(cost breakdown page 72)
* $250,000 allocated explicitly for *personal travel* using a private corporate jet
* $90 million in stock awards

Meanwhile, the company continues to permanently shut down locations and layoff employees. Niccol recently [announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that the company would eliminate 1,100 corporate employees (not baristas) to

>“increase operational efficiency, increase accountability, reduce complexity, and drive better integration”. Niccol explained that the layoffs, which took effect 2/25, were necessary to address these issues.

Now, after these layoffs, the **CEO tells workers to step it up** and that he

>“[wants corporate employees to work harder](https://qz.com/starbucks-corporate-workers-big-fix-menu-cuts-1851767920?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=quartz_reddit) and take accountability for the coffee giant’s financial health” claiming that the chain's turnaround now relies on greater accountability; “[we own whether or not this place grows](https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/starbucks-ceo-tells-workers-to-step-it-up-after-layoffs-3fdba9f3)”. 

This greater accountability doesn’t seem to apply to Niccol. He also[ announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that hiring for future partners in the U.S. will require relocation to Seattle to work in the head office. Meanwhile Niccol himself is not required to relocate from his California home and maintains his ability to travel the 1,000 miles between his primary residence and the Seattle headquarters for his commute so he can work in person 3 days a week. The greater hypocrisy lies in the fact that this decision to allow Niccol to commute on the company's dime completely disregards their promises to combat climate change.

>[Starbucks environmental promise](https://about.starbucks.com/our-environmental-promise-give-more-than-we-take/): “At Starbucks, we promise to *give more than we take* from the planet. Our comprehensive approach is built on our commitment to build a *more sustainable, equitable and resilient future* for coffee, farmers, communities and our planet. Across our company, we are testing and scaling innovative solutions to support partners, farmers and communities in the face of global climate change.”

>[“Starbucks touts ](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/starbucks-new-ceo-has-a-big-footprint-commutes-private-jet-nevermind-climate-goals-3df1aa5f)its “decades-long commitment to find solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change”, and claims achieving this goal “takes all of us”, it nonetheless has allowed the new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol to commute weekly from his California home via private jet”. [“Estimates, likely on the low side](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf), “indicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That’s roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.”

Shareholders did express concern over this issue, making a [proposal](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (page 96) requesting an annual emissions congruency report. The Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders [vote against](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (pg 97) this proposal, claiming such a report is not an effective use of time and company resources, and they argue that Niccol should use the private jet to enhance his personal safety. The obvious solution to this is to have Niccol relocate to the Seattle area. Considering he decided to relocate the entire Chipotle headquarters, and 400 jobs, from Colorado to his city of residence in California, I doubt he would ever choose to make that move for the benefit of the company, let alone the environment. 

>Defending the cost of hiring Niccol, the Starbucks board stated that they believe “Mr. Niccol, a highly sought-after, effective leader with a proven track record, has the ideal industry experience and operational background to drive sustainable, long-term growth at Starbucks”. “[Starbucks' critical need](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) for a transformative leader at a pivotal moment in its history” led them to poach Niccol from Chipotle, where he was also the CEO.

Clearly the company believes their investment will pay off. Initially, it did. After announcing Niccol as CEO the companies stock price shot up 24%[ (pg 43)](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf). It has since then fallen.

The fact that **Niccol is a known union buster** surely helped secure his employment, not that the company would ever admit it. It’s no surprise that union negotiations with the company have stalled since December.

>Currently, ""[union members](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-01/starbucks-union-baristas-contract-talks) remain critical of how bargaining has been conducted under Niccol's tenure and have questioned his compensation package.""

The previous CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, pivoted away from the tough stance of founder Howard Shultz regarding unions, and agreed (in Feb 2024) to [begin contract discussions](https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/amid-rising-unionizing-efforts-starbucks-accepts-mediation-with-unionized-workers/91142408). 6 months later, Niccol was announced as the new CEO. While the company listed other reasons for the decision, one can only wonder...

Brian Niccol is no stranger to success. He is credited with many achievements in his previous positions at Pizza Hut (CMO), Taco Bell (CMO & CEO), and, most notably, Chipotle (CEO). Much of his success in these positions was achieved through digital innovation. 

* Pizza Hut (CMO 2007-2011)
   * Introduced mobile phone ordering in 2008, followed by an app in 2009 which, after 3 months, generated $1 million in sales.
* Taco Bell (CMO 2011-2015)(CEO 2015-2018)
   * Oversaw implementation of breakfast menu, Cantina Bell menu, the launch of Doritos Locos Taco, and the “Live Mas” slogan
   * Increased revenue, market share, and profitability
* Chipotle (CEO 2018-2024)
   * Implemented chipotlanes
   * Added digital order pick-up shelves
   * Doubled revenue, increased profits x7
   * Increased stock price x8 

**Will this success translate to his new job as CEO of Starbucks?** ***I would argue NO.*** 

Starbucks gave Niccol an outrageous compensation package, and it's questionable that their investment will pay off. His heavy focus on digital presence seems unlikely to yield the same level of success it did in his other jobs. Online ordering is a common tool utilized by most companies now, like Starbucks, unlike when Niccol pushed it forward at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. While he is credited with creating secondary make lines for online orders at Chipotle, one [article](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/chipotle-ceo-brian-niccol-listens-while-he-works/#:~:text=Following%20the%20savvy%20action%20of,it%20made%20customers%20happier%2C%20too.) credits the origin of the idea to a Chipotle store operator, not Niccol. There is no doubt Niccol has extensive digital experience, but Starbucks already has both mobile ordering and drive throughs available for customers to use. The long mobile order wait times are the one area Starbucks really needs to improve. While I have no doubt Niccol will have an impact here, I doubt he will be able to attain the same degree of success he did with Taco Bell or Chipotle, something shareholders and investors clearly expect to see from him again.

He joined both Taco Bell and Chipotle during times when they were struggling due to issues with food quality. Taco Bell was dealing with the fallout of a lawsuit over beef quality that lead to a [28%](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/us/taco-bell-still-hurting-from-beef-quality-lawsuit-idUSN1E76D0LV/) decrease in operating profit Q2 2011. Chipotle had the infamous e.coli outbreak in 2015 that severely damaged the brand. Niccol is credited with leading a successful turnaround effort at both, but the companies really had no other place to go but up after these things were fixed, something any CEO was capable of achieving.

""But look at how much he increased revenue, profit, and stock price at Chipotle!"" One might argue this, but let me tell you how he really achieved this. Price increases, prices increase, and then more price increases. The company hadn’t increased prices too much in the years before Niccol became CEO. After he joined in 2018 prices increased about 10% across the year. Since 2021 the company has [increased prices 7 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/1h60h2q/chipotle_to_raise_prices_for_the_7th_time_since/) under his leadership. While some increase is necessary and expected, his increases far exceeded both. Since he left, prices increased once by 2% in December, and the new CEO (Scott Boatwright) announced the company will absorb any cost increases incurred by Trump's tariffs. Something I highly doubt Niccol would have done. ""But Starbucks pledged to not increase prices in 2025!"" Yeah, except they made this promise before the announcement of the tariffs. Also, have they actually kept this promise so far? [This Reddit user claims not.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1j6ofvn/whats_up_with_starbucks_raising_prices_after/) To be fair, Niccol did recognize that many people have expressed displeasure with Starbucks prices and how they’ve been increasing, which he ignored at Chipotle. Something I’m sure he regrets now considering the tariffs. 

Overall, based on the information I’ve gathered it seems like much of his previous success was primarily due to lucky timing. I don’t see him being successful at Starbucks. Thus far, stock prices would indicate I’m not wrong. The changes he has made so far haven’t done anything to improve the company. The practice, which was halted in 2020 during the pandemic, generated some buzz initially, but quickly fell apart as most baristas didn’t meet expectations. Considering a major issue Starbucks faces is long wait times, the implemented idea by Niccol seems counterintuitive. Baristas don't have time for it but some have claimed they've been [written up](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1iz8tyc/written_up_for_forgetting_to_write_on_cups/&ved=2ahUKEwjH_5eJ7seNAxW2tokEHTatCbYQFnoECCQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1UsYFiNHs2RU1HaxBDdyQi) or [sent home](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1j5cutx/sent_home_for_not_writing_on_cups/%23:~:text%3DSent%2520home%2520for%2520not%2520writing%2520on%2520cups%2520:%2520r/starbucks&ved=2ahUKEwiZjKHO7seNAxUGlokEHTM_H60Q-tANegQIDRAP&usg=AOvVaw2Oa8R0qIxiAGWjQS025n7s) by their manager for failing to do so. Overall, the idea seems to have backfired.

Niccol also decided to change the dress code, requiring baristas to wear solid black shirts, a change not well received by employees.

>""Customers care more about the wait time for their latte than the shirt their barista is [wearing](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code).""

Changing the dress code seems entirely unnecessary and useless. I fail to see how the color of a baristas shirt is going to impact guest perception. Personally, I've never even noticed the color of their shirts before. The decision seems to be one meant to impress shareholders by showing Starbucks is 'professional' and 'high end'. Additionally, it's surely meant to reinforce company culture (something Niccol is supposed to excel at improving) but the change has done the opposite of improving employee satisfaction, negatively impacting moral for many. Niccol, a known union buster, didn't involve the union in this decision either.

>""[Union workers say](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code) the change is both restrictive and unproductive—and now, baristas are walking out."" ""In an email to supporters, Starbucks Workers United—the union representing Starbucks baristas—called the dress code “restrictive,” adding that it was implemented “without input from the baristas it affects.” The union has been bargaining to reach a contract with Starbucks for over three years, with no end in sight. It says that the new dress code represents “bad faith bargaining,” alleging that the code undermines a tentative agreement about attire made at the bargaining table."" ""Starbucks should be working to finish the contract and solve its staffing issue—not implementing a new dress code. “We’re more than mad because the changes that the company is making don’t address the issues that we’re facing in the stores.""

Let's be real it's a coffee shop, not fine dining. Black shirt, blue shirt, purple shirt...no one cares. Except the CEO apparently. He wants to create a consistent and recognizable brand experience for guests as if the green apron didn't already accomplish that. Both the dress code change and cup writing seem to be out of touch decisions. Maybe Niccol needs to spend some time working as a barista to figure out how he could actually improve things for both guests and employees.

Brian Niccol gets too much hype in the corporate world in my opinion. I’m just waiting for his downfall–honestly I’m hoping for it.

Let's be real it's a coffee shop, not fine dining. Black shirt, blue shirt, purple shirt...no one cares. Except the CEO apparently. He wants to create a consistent and recognizable brand experience for guests as if the green apron didn't already accomplish that. Both the dress code change and cup writing seem to be out of touch decisions. Maybe Niccol needs to spend some time working as a barista to figure out how he could actually improve things for both guests and employees.

Brian Niccol gets too much hype in the corporate world in my opinion. I’m just waiting for his downfall–honestly I’m hoping for it.

1kyi9ui_SBUX,SBUX,Discussion SBUX -Put Buy to open,"I am in r/Starbucks, the employees and patrons are upset over recent changes and price increases. I decided to do my first options trade, a Put, on SBUX as I anticipate it to go back down around $70.00. I believe this will occur with reduced earnings, employee dissatisfaction, and high prices driving away more sales. 

I am a chicken and purchased the Put to expire in September after the August earnings call with a Strike Price of $80. Fidelity showed my break even is $75 and I anticipate it to go to $70, I don't anticipate it going lower than this (Howard Schultz won't allow it). 

I believe if the price tanks back down to $70 there will be another ceo.

1ky3655_GOOGL,GOOGL,Brian Niccol – Starbucks CEO Analysis,"As part of its leadership overhaul, Starbucks hired a new CFO. Cathy Smith was awarded a $5 million sign-on bonus on top of a base pay of $925,000 per year and $4.5 million in stock incentives. Yet this is nothing compared to the compensation package of their new CEO, Brian Niccol, who was poached from Chipotle by Starbucks to transform the brand and bring success back to the business. The company aims to increase earnings, yet they awarded Niccol a **$96 million dollar compensation package**, making him the highest paid CEO in the company’s history. As one of the highest paid executives in corporate America, [Niccol earned approximately 6,666 times that of its average barista](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf). It is worth pointing out, in regard to that number, that many Starbucks employees work part time. This compensation pack put him above the CEO of Apple, Microsoft, Disney, GE, and more when comparing 2024 CEO annual pay. Apple and Microsoft generated net incomes that were almost *triple* that of Starbucks in 2024, which makes this all the more shocking in my opinion.

**Brian Niccol Starbucks Compensation Package Breakdown:**

* $10 million signing bonus
* $5 million sign on bonus after one month of employment
* $1.6 million annual base salary
* [$418,071 additional compensation benefit ](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf)(cost breakdown page 72)
* $250,000 allocated explicitly for *personal travel* using a private corporate jet
* $90 million in stock awards

Meanwhile, the company continues to permanently shut down locations and layoff employees. Niccol recently [announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that the company would eliminate 1,100 corporate employees (not baristas) to

>“increase operational efficiency, increase accountability, reduce complexity, and drive better integration”. Niccol explained that the layoffs, which took effect 2/25, were necessary to address these issues.

Now, after these layoffs, the **CEO tells workers to step it up** and that he

>“[wants corporate employees to work harder](https://qz.com/starbucks-corporate-workers-big-fix-menu-cuts-1851767920?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=quartz_reddit) and take accountability for the coffee giant’s financial health” claiming that the chain's turnaround now relies on greater accountability; “[we own whether or not this place grows](https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/starbucks-ceo-tells-workers-to-step-it-up-after-layoffs-3fdba9f3)”. 

This greater accountability doesn’t seem to apply to Niccol. He also[ announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that hiring for future partners in the U.S. will require relocation to Seattle to work in the head office. Meanwhile Niccol himself is not required to relocate from his California home and maintains his ability to travel the 1,000 miles between his primary residence and the Seattle headquarters for his commute so he can work in person 3 days a week. The greater hypocrisy lies in the fact that this decision to allow Niccol to commute on the company's dime completely disregards their promises to combat climate change.

>[Starbucks environmental promise](https://about.starbucks.com/our-environmental-promise-give-more-than-we-take/): “At Starbucks, we promise to *give more than we take* from the planet. Our comprehensive approach is built on our commitment to build a *more sustainable, equitable and resilient future* for coffee, farmers, communities and our planet. Across our company, we are testing and scaling innovative solutions to support partners, farmers and communities in the face of global climate change.”

>[“Starbucks touts ](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/starbucks-new-ceo-has-a-big-footprint-commutes-private-jet-nevermind-climate-goals-3df1aa5f)its “decades-long commitment to find solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change”, and claims achieving this goal “takes all of us”, it nonetheless has allowed the new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol to commute weekly from his California home via private jet”. [“Estimates, likely on the low side](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf), “indicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That’s roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.”

Shareholders did express concern over this issue, making a [proposal](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (page 96) requesting an annual emissions congruency report. The Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders [vote against](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (pg 97) this proposal, claiming such a report is not an effective use of time and company resources, and they argue that Niccol should use the private jet to enhance his personal safety. The obvious solution to this is to have Niccol relocate to the Seattle area. Considering he decided to relocate the entire Chipotle headquarters, and 400 jobs, from Colorado to his city of residence in California, I doubt he would ever choose to make that move for the benefit of the company, let alone the environment. 

>Defending the cost of hiring Niccol, the Starbucks board stated that they believe “Mr. Niccol, a highly sought-after, effective leader with a proven track record, has the ideal industry experience and operational background to drive sustainable, long-term growth at Starbucks”. “[Starbucks' critical need](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) for a transformative leader at a pivotal moment in its history” led them to poach Niccol from Chipotle, where he was also the CEO.

Clearly the company believes their investment will pay off. Initially, it did. After announcing Niccol as CEO the companies stock price shot up 24%[ (pg 43)](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf). It has since then fallen.

The fact that **Niccol is a known union buster** surely helped secure his employment, not that the company would ever admit it. It’s no surprise that union negotiations with the company have stalled since December.

>Currently, ""[union members](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-01/starbucks-union-baristas-contract-talks) remain critical of how bargaining has been conducted under Niccol's tenure and have questioned his compensation package.""

The previous CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, pivoted away from the tough stance of founder Howard Shultz regarding unions, and agreed (in Feb 2024) to [begin contract discussions](https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/amid-rising-unionizing-efforts-starbucks-accepts-mediation-with-unionized-workers/91142408). 6 months later, Niccol was announced as the new CEO. While the company listed other reasons for the decision, one can only wonder...

Brian Niccol is no stranger to success. He is credited with many achievements in his previous positions at Pizza Hut (CMO), Taco Bell (CMO & CEO), and, most notably, Chipotle (CEO). Much of his success in these positions was achieved through digital innovation. 

* Pizza Hut (CMO 2007-2011)
   * Introduced mobile phone ordering in 2008, followed by an app in 2009 which, after 3 months, generated $1 million in sales.
* Taco Bell (CMO 2011-2015)(CEO 2015-2018)
   * Oversaw implementation of breakfast menu, Cantina Bell menu, the launch of Doritos Locos Taco, and the “Live Mas” slogan
   * Increased revenue, market share, and profitability
* Chipotle (CEO 2018-2024)
   * Implemented chipotlanes
   * Added digital order pick-up shelves
   * Doubled revenue, increased profits x7
   * Increased stock price x8 

**Will this success translate to his new job as CEO of Starbucks?** ***I would argue NO.*** 

Starbucks gave Niccol an outrageous compensation package, and it's questionable that their investment will pay off. His heavy focus on digital presence seems unlikely to yield the same level of success it did in his other jobs. Online ordering is a common tool utilized by most companies now, like Starbucks, unlike when Niccol pushed it forward at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. While he is credited with creating secondary make lines for online orders at Chipotle, one [article](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/chipotle-ceo-brian-niccol-listens-while-he-works/#:~:text=Following%20the%20savvy%20action%20of,it%20made%20customers%20happier%2C%20too.) credits the origin of the idea to a Chipotle store operator, not Niccol. There is no doubt Niccol has extensive digital experience, but Starbucks already has both mobile ordering and drive throughs available for customers to use. The long mobile order wait times are the one area Starbucks really needs to improve. While I have no doubt Niccol will have an impact here, I doubt he will be able to attain the same degree of success he did with Taco Bell or Chipotle, something shareholders and investors clearly expect to see from him again.

He joined both Taco Bell and Chipotle during times when they were struggling due to issues with food quality. Taco Bell was dealing with the fallout of a lawsuit over beef quality that lead to a [28%](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/us/taco-bell-still-hurting-from-beef-quality-lawsuit-idUSN1E76D0LV/) decrease in operating profit Q2 2011. Chipotle had the infamous e.coli outbreak in 2015 that severely damaged the brand. Niccol is credited with leading a successful turnaround effort at both, but the companies really had no other place to go but up after these things were fixed, something any CEO was capable of achieving.

""But look at how much he increased revenue, profit, and stock price at Chipotle!"" One might argue this, but let me tell you how he really achieved this. Price increases, prices increase, and then more price increases. The company hadn’t increased prices too much in the years before Niccol became CEO. After he joined in 2018 prices increased about 10% across the year. Since 2021 the company has [increased prices 7 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/1h60h2q/chipotle_to_raise_prices_for_the_7th_time_since/) under his leadership. While some increase is necessary and expected, his increases far exceeded both. Since he left, prices increased once by 2% in December, and the new CEO (Scott Boatwright) announced the company will absorb any cost increases incurred by Trump's tariffs. Something I highly doubt Niccol would have done. ""But Starbucks pledged to not increase prices in 2025!"" Yeah, except they made this promise before the announcement of the tariffs. Also, have they actually kept this promise so far? [This Reddit user claims not.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1j6ofvn/whats_up_with_starbucks_raising_prices_after/) To be fair, Niccol did recognize that many people have expressed displeasure with Starbucks prices and how they’ve been increasing, which he ignored at Chipotle. Something I’m sure he regrets now considering the tariffs. 

Overall, based on the information I’ve gathered it seems like much of his previous success was primarily due to lucky timing. I don’t see him being successful at Starbucks. Thus far, stock prices would indicate I’m not wrong. The changes he has made so far haven’t done anything to improve the company. The practice, which was halted in 2020 during the pandemic, generated some buzz initially, but quickly fell apart as most baristas didn’t meet expectations. Considering a major issue Starbucks faces is long wait times, the implemented idea by Niccol seems counterintuitive. Baristas don't have time for it but some have claimed they've been [written up](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1iz8tyc/written_up_for_forgetting_to_write_on_cups/&ved=2ahUKEwjH_5eJ7seNAxW2tokEHTatCbYQFnoECCQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1UsYFiNHs2RU1HaxBDdyQi) or [sent home](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1j5cutx/sent_home_for_not_writing_on_cups/%23:~:text%3DSent%2520home%2520for%2520not%2520writing%2520on%2520cups%2520:%2520r/starbucks&ved=2ahUKEwiZjKHO7seNAxUGlokEHTM_H60Q-tANegQIDRAP&usg=AOvVaw2Oa8R0qIxiAGWjQS025n7s) by their manager for failing to do so. Overall, the idea seems to have backfired.

Niccol also decided to change the dress code, requiring baristas to wear solid black shirts, a change not well received by employees.

>""Customers care more about the wait time for their latte than the shirt their barista is [wearing](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code).""

Changing the dress code seems entirely unnecessary and useless. I fail to see how the color of a baristas shirt is going to impact guest perception. Personally, I've never even noticed the color of their shirts before. The decision seems to be one meant to impress shareholders by showing Starbucks is 'professional' and 'high end'. Additionally, it's surely meant to reinforce company culture (something Niccol is supposed to excel at improving) but the change has done the opposite of improving employee satisfaction, negatively impacting moral for many. Niccol, a known union buster, didn't involve the union in this decision either.

>""[Union workers say](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code) the change is both restrictive and unproductive—and now, baristas are walking out."" ""In an email to supporters, Starbucks Workers United—the union representing Starbucks baristas—called the dress code “restrictive,” adding that it was implemented “without input from the baristas it affects.” The union has been bargaining to reach a contract with Starbucks for over three years, with no end in sight. It says that the new dress code represents “bad faith bargaining,” alleging that the code undermines a tentative agreement about attire made at the bargaining table."" ""Starbucks should be working to finish the contract and solve its staffing issue—not implementing a new dress code. “We’re more than mad because the changes that the company is making don’t address the issues that we’re facing in the stores.""

Let's be real it's a coffee shop, not fine dining. Black shirt, blue shirt, purple shirt...no one cares. Except the CEO apparently. He wants to create a consistent and recognizable brand experience for guests as if the green apron didn't already accomplish that. Both the dress code change and cup writing seem to be out of touch decisions. Maybe Niccol needs to spend some time working as a barista to figure out how he could actually improve things for both guests and employees.

Brian Niccol gets too much hype in the corporate world in my opinion. I’m just waiting for his downfall–honestly I’m hoping for it.

“Our financial results don’t yet reflect our progress, but we have real momentum with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a video posted on the company’s website. “We’re testing and learning at speed and we’re seeing changes in our coffeehouses.”

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 41 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected
* Revenue: $8.8 billion, it was not immediately clear how it compared to the $8.82 billion expected

Excluding items, the company earned 41 cents per share.

Net sales rose 2% to $8.8 billion.

Starbucks’ same-store sales fell for its fifth straight quarter. The company’s sales have slumped as consumers in the U.S. and China, its two largest markets, seek cheaper coffee options.

Under Niccol, who took the reins in September, the company has been trying to turn around its U.S. business by getting “back to Starbucks” and returning its focus to coffee and the customer experience. In October, the company suspended its forecast for fiscal 2025 as it unveiled the early stages of its turnaround strategy.

The company’s global same-store sales fell 1% in its second quarter, fueled by a 2% decline in transactions. In Starbucks’ home market, the traffic decline was even steeper.

U.S. locations saw transactions fall 4%, dragging its same-store sales down by 2%.China’s same-store sales were flat for the quarter, as lower average ticket offset transaction growth.

DEEPSEEK:

* OPENAI accuses China's deepseek of using its model for Training:
* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M
* ASML on Deepseek: 
* “For AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress on costs and power consumption. Lowering costs also leads to more volume...So I will say any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to cost reduction will increase the opportunity.”

* AAPL - Oppenheimer downgrades AAPL to perform from outperform, lowers FY26 EPS estimate by 4% to $7.95, below consensus of $8.23.

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of the year, with inflation and interest rates taking center stage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver the verdict tomorrow, and while markets are watching closely, there’s little expectation of a rate cut—current odds stand at a slim 0.5%.  
  
Tomorrow’s after-hours session will bring updates from three tech heavyweights: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Their numbers are poised to offer fresh insights into how the sector is navigating a volatile market landscape as 2025 gets rolling.

# Before Market Open: 

* The first chipmaker to report earnings since DeepSeek’s AI bombshell, **ASML Holding** has some explaining to do. With analysts eager for updates on capital spending, the real spotlight will be on how tariffs and geopolitical tension are squeezing the company’s margins. Shares have been under pressure, but Wall Street remains optimistic with every analyst covering the stock issuing a “buy” rating. Consensus expectations sit at $6.71 EPS and $9.02 billion in revenue. ($ASML)

# After Market Close: 

* **IBM** may have roots in legacy tech, but it’s been steadily planting seeds in AI, cloud computing, and quantum technology. These forward-looking investments make the company more than just a relic of tech’s past, even if its pace of innovation is deliberate. Add to that a stable dividend that offers a cushion for patient investors, and IBM is quietly making its case as a long-term play. Analysts anticipate $3.79 EPS on $17.6 billion in revenue this quarter. ($IBM)

1icttso_PATH,PATH,I'm a professional trader and this is Everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC and Big Tech earnings. Includes a detailed analysis of ASML and SBUX earnings.,"FOMC decision today - expectation is for a dovish FOMC.

DEEPSEEK:

* OPENAI accuses China's deepseek of using its model for Training:
* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M
* ASML on Deepseek: 
* “For AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress on costs and power consumption. Lowering costs also leads to more volume...So I will say any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to cost reduction will increase the opportunity.”

  
Main things to watch in the market:

* Right now, the key thing to watch is the CAPEX number for META and MSFT when they announce earnings tomorrow. If it is massively down from expectations, this will be seen as another selling trigger. Capex guidance in line will be seen as a reiteration that these firms are not massively concerned and will lead to a rip in semiconductors. The 2nd scenario is my base case.

MAG7:

* AAPL - Apple (AAPL) has been in secret cooperation with SpaceX and T-Mobile (TMUS) to support the Starlink satellite service in its latest iPhone operating system, which would serve as an alternative to Apple's current in-house satellite communication service, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports, citing people familiar with the matter.
* AAPL - Oppenheimer downgrades AAPL to perform from outperform, lowers FY26 EPS estimate by 4% to $7.95, below consensus of $8.23. Our revision is based on reduced estimates for iPhone sales over the next 12-18 months. Said main headwinds for the company are stronger competition in China, and lack of compelling AI features
* META - CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring the purchase of a property in Washington, D.C., according to sources cited by the Financial Times. Notable in implying improved relationship with president. 
* NVDA - Ming Chi Kuo, one of the top semiconductor analysts, says that While scaling laws are hitting limits, Nvidia remains the dominant player. Kuo suggests its edge will grow when scaling laws regain momentum, but short-term supply chain issues with the GB200 NVL72 could impact expectations.
* TSLA - NORWAY SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND CEO: NO PLANS TO PULL OUT OF TESLA

* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M

Looking ahead, we see Q1 ’25 net sales in the range of €7.5 billion to €8.0 billion, gross margin between 52% and 53%, and full-year sales of €30 billion to €35 billion. AI remains a key growth driver for our industry, though it creates shifting market dynamics among our customers. We’re confident our lithography leadership will continue to serve as a critical enabler for advanced semiconductor roadmaps.”

CEO Christophe Fouquet’s Commentary:

*  “Our fourth-quarter was a record in terms of revenue, driven by additional upgrades and first revenue recognition of two High NA EUV systems. 2024 overall was another record year, with total net sales of €28.3 billion and gross margin of 51.3%.  Looking ahead, we see Q1 ’25 net sales in the range of €7.5 billion to €8.0 billion, gross margin between 52% and 53%, and full-year sales of €30 billion to €35 billion. AI remains a key growth driver for our industry, though it creates shifting market dynamics among our customers. We’re confident our lithography leadership will continue to serve as a critical enabler for advanced semiconductor roadmaps.”

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of the year, with inflation and interest rates taking center stage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver the verdict tomorrow, and while markets are watching closely, there’s little expectation of a rate cut—current odds stand at a slim 0.5%.  
  
Tomorrow’s after-hours session will bring updates from three tech heavyweights: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Their numbers are poised to offer fresh insights into how the sector is navigating a volatile market landscape as 2025 gets rolling.

# Before Market Open: 

* The first chipmaker to report earnings since DeepSeek’s AI bombshell, **ASML Holding** has some explaining to do. With analysts eager for updates on capital spending, the real spotlight will be on how tariffs and geopolitical tension are squeezing the company’s margins. Shares have been under pressure, but Wall Street remains optimistic with every analyst covering the stock issuing a “buy” rating. Consensus expectations sit at $6.71 EPS and $9.02 billion in revenue. ($ASML)

# After Market Close: 

* **IBM** may have roots in legacy tech, but it’s been steadily planting seeds in AI, cloud computing, and quantum technology. These forward-looking investments make the company more than just a relic of tech’s past, even if its pace of innovation is deliberate. Add to that a stable dividend that offers a cushion for patient investors, and IBM is quietly making its case as a long-term play. Analysts anticipate $3.79 EPS on $17.6 billion in revenue this quarter. ($IBM)

1icttso_SNOW,SNOW,I'm a professional trader and this is Everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC and Big Tech earnings. Includes a detailed analysis of ASML and SBUX earnings.,"FOMC decision today - expectation is for a dovish FOMC.

DEEPSEEK:

* OPENAI accuses China's deepseek of using its model for Training:
* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M
* ASML on Deepseek: 
* “For AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress on costs and power consumption. Lowering costs also leads to more volume...So I will say any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to cost reduction will increase the opportunity.”

  
Main things to watch in the market:

* Right now, the key thing to watch is the CAPEX number for META and MSFT when they announce earnings tomorrow. If it is massively down from expectations, this will be seen as another selling trigger. Capex guidance in line will be seen as a reiteration that these firms are not massively concerned and will lead to a rip in semiconductors. The 2nd scenario is my base case.

MAG7:

* AAPL - Apple (AAPL) has been in secret cooperation with SpaceX and T-Mobile (TMUS) to support the Starlink satellite service in its latest iPhone operating system, which would serve as an alternative to Apple's current in-house satellite communication service, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports, citing people familiar with the matter.
* AAPL - Oppenheimer downgrades AAPL to perform from outperform, lowers FY26 EPS estimate by 4% to $7.95, below consensus of $8.23. Our revision is based on reduced estimates for iPhone sales over the next 12-18 months. Said main headwinds for the company are stronger competition in China, and lack of compelling AI features
* META - CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring the purchase of a property in Washington, D.C., according to sources cited by the Financial Times. Notable in implying improved relationship with president. 
* NVDA - Ming Chi Kuo, one of the top semiconductor analysts, says that While scaling laws are hitting limits, Nvidia remains the dominant player. Kuo suggests its edge will grow when scaling laws regain momentum, but short-term supply chain issues with the GB200 NVL72 could impact expectations.
* TSLA - NORWAY SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND CEO: NO PLANS TO PULL OUT OF TESLA

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of the year, with inflation and interest rates taking center stage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver the verdict tomorrow, and while markets are watching closely, there’s little expectation of a rate cut—current odds stand at a slim 0.5%.  
  
Tomorrow’s after-hours session will bring updates from three tech heavyweights: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Their numbers are poised to offer fresh insights into how the sector is navigating a volatile market landscape as 2025 gets rolling.

# Before Market Open: 

* The first chipmaker to report earnings since DeepSeek’s AI bombshell, **ASML Holding** has some explaining to do. With analysts eager for updates on capital spending, the real spotlight will be on how tariffs and geopolitical tension are squeezing the company’s margins. Shares have been under pressure, but Wall Street remains optimistic with every analyst covering the stock issuing a “buy” rating. Consensus expectations sit at $6.71 EPS and $9.02 billion in revenue. ($ASML)

# After Market Close: 

* **IBM** may have roots in legacy tech, but it’s been steadily planting seeds in AI, cloud computing, and quantum technology. These forward-looking investments make the company more than just a relic of tech’s past, even if its pace of innovation is deliberate. Add to that a stable dividend that offers a cushion for patient investors, and IBM is quietly making its case as a long-term play. Analysts anticipate $3.79 EPS on $17.6 billion in revenue this quarter. ($IBM)

1icttso_META,META,I'm a professional trader and this is Everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC and Big Tech earnings. Includes a detailed analysis of ASML and SBUX earnings.,"FOMC decision today - expectation is for a dovish FOMC.

DEEPSEEK:

* OPENAI accuses China's deepseek of using its model for Training:
* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M
* ASML on Deepseek: 
* “For AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress on costs and power consumption. Lowering costs also leads to more volume...So I will say any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to cost reduction will increase the opportunity.”

  
Main things to watch in the market:

* Right now, the key thing to watch is the CAPEX number for META and MSFT when they announce earnings tomorrow. If it is massively down from expectations, this will be seen as another selling trigger. Capex guidance in line will be seen as a reiteration that these firms are not massively concerned and will lead to a rip in semiconductors. The 2nd scenario is my base case.

MAG7:

* AAPL - Apple (AAPL) has been in secret cooperation with SpaceX and T-Mobile (TMUS) to support the Starlink satellite service in its latest iPhone operating system, which would serve as an alternative to Apple's current in-house satellite communication service, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports, citing people familiar with the matter.
* AAPL - Oppenheimer downgrades AAPL to perform from outperform, lowers FY26 EPS estimate by 4% to $7.95, below consensus of $8.23. Our revision is based on reduced estimates for iPhone sales over the next 12-18 months. Said main headwinds for the company are stronger competition in China, and lack of compelling AI features
* META - CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring the purchase of a property in Washington, D.C., according to sources cited by the Financial Times. Notable in implying improved relationship with president. 
* NVDA - Ming Chi Kuo, one of the top semiconductor analysts, says that While scaling laws are hitting limits, Nvidia remains the dominant player. Kuo suggests its edge will grow when scaling laws regain momentum, but short-term supply chain issues with the GB200 NVL72 could impact expectations.
* TSLA - NORWAY SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND CEO: NO PLANS TO PULL OUT OF TESLA

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of the year, with inflation and interest rates taking center stage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver the verdict tomorrow, and while markets are watching closely, there’s little expectation of a rate cut—current odds stand at a slim 0.5%.  
  
Tomorrow’s after-hours session will bring updates from three tech heavyweights: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Their numbers are poised to offer fresh insights into how the sector is navigating a volatile market landscape as 2025 gets rolling.

# Before Market Open: 

* The first chipmaker to report earnings since DeepSeek’s AI bombshell, **ASML Holding** has some explaining to do. With analysts eager for updates on capital spending, the real spotlight will be on how tariffs and geopolitical tension are squeezing the company’s margins. Shares have been under pressure, but Wall Street remains optimistic with every analyst covering the stock issuing a “buy” rating. Consensus expectations sit at $6.71 EPS and $9.02 billion in revenue. ($ASML)

# After Market Close: 

* **IBM** may have roots in legacy tech, but it’s been steadily planting seeds in AI, cloud computing, and quantum technology. These forward-looking investments make the company more than just a relic of tech’s past, even if its pace of innovation is deliberate. Add to that a stable dividend that offers a cushion for patient investors, and IBM is quietly making its case as a long-term play. Analysts anticipate $3.79 EPS on $17.6 billion in revenue this quarter. ($IBM)

DEEPSEEK:

* OPENAI accuses China's deepseek of using its model for Training:
* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M
* ASML on Deepseek: 
* “For AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress on costs and power consumption. Lowering costs also leads to more volume...So I will say any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to cost reduction will increase the opportunity.”

  
Main things to watch in the market:

* Right now, the key thing to watch is the CAPEX number for META and MSFT when they announce earnings tomorrow. If it is massively down from expectations, this will be seen as another selling trigger. Capex guidance in line will be seen as a reiteration that these firms are not massively concerned and will lead to a rip in semiconductors. The 2nd scenario is my base case.

* AAPL - Apple (AAPL) has been in secret cooperation with SpaceX and T-Mobile (TMUS) to support the Starlink satellite service in its latest iPhone operating system, which would serve as an alternative to Apple's current in-house satellite communication service, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports, citing people familiar with the matter.
* AAPL - Oppenheimer downgrades AAPL to perform from outperform, lowers FY26 EPS estimate by 4% to $7.95, below consensus of $8.23. Our revision is based on reduced estimates for iPhone sales over the next 12-18 months. Said main headwinds for the company are stronger competition in China, and lack of compelling AI features
* META - CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring the purchase of a property in Washington, D.C., according to sources cited by the Financial Times. Notable in implying improved relationship with president. 
* NVDA - Ming Chi Kuo, one of the top semiconductor analysts, says that While scaling laws are hitting limits, Nvidia remains the dominant player. Kuo suggests its edge will grow when scaling laws regain momentum, but short-term supply chain issues with the GB200 NVL72 could impact expectations.

The coffee giant kicked off a turnaround plan last quarter in the hopes of reviving its U.S. business, which has slumped over the last year.

“While we have room for improvement, we’re making progress as planned, and have confidence we’re on the right track,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a video released on the company’s website on Tuesday afternoon.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 69 cents vs. 67 cents expected

Revenue: $9.4 billion vs. $9.31 billion expected

The company’s net sales of $9.4 billion were unchanged from a year earlier.

The company’s same-store sales fell 4%, fueled by a 6% decline in traffic to its stores. Wall Street was expecting a steeper drop of 5.5%, according to StreetAccount estimates. Both its U.S. and international locations outperformed expectations.

U.S. same-store sales slid 4% as traffic to its cafes fell 8%. Under Niccol, who took the reins in September, the company has been trying to turn around its U.S. business by getting “back to Starbucks” and returning its focus to coffee and the customer experience.

Outside of its home market, same-store sales also declined 4%.

Starbucks’ same-store sales in China, its second-largest market, fell 6%, fueled by a 4% in average ticket. The coffee giant has been leaning into discounts in China to compete with rivals that have much lower prices, like Luckin Coffee.

1i5lkpo_PATH,PATH, Starbucks: A Promising Turnaround Opportunity,"Starbucks is taking exciting steps to rejuvenate its brand and reclaim its special place in the hearts of customers. With a focus on streamlining operations and enhancing the in-store experience, the company is committed to revitalizing its essence through the innovative 'Back to Starbucks' initiative. This strategic approach sparks optimism about the future, and I truly believe that as Starbucks reconnects with its core values, we will see a positive impact on its stock performance.



Key Strategies for Success:

1. Boosting Efficiency through Workforce Restructuring:

Starbucks is embarking on a thoughtful restructuring journey aimed at improving labor cost efficiency. The company employs approximately 361,000 people worldwide, with 211,000 of them based in the U.S. Importantly, most of these roles involve customer-facing store positions, which remain unaffected by the changes. The restructuring is primarily focused on corporate support and other non-store roles, affecting about 10,000 employees, or roughly 2.8% of the total workforce. This move not only positions Starbucks for greater efficiency but also reaffirms its commitment to its employees.

2. Enhancing the Store Experience for Paying Customers:

In an effort to elevate the quality of in-store service, Starbucks has made the decision to limit access to certain amenities to paying customers. While this change may seem controversial, it is a necessary step to ensure a better customer experience and address ongoing challenges. Similar to Netflix’s experience when it tightened its policy on account sharing, Starbucks’ focus on improving the in-store ambiance is expected to lead to impressive revenue growth. I am confident that this decision will not only enhance the overall experience but will ultimately be beneficial for the company's bottom line.

3. New Leadership Driving Efficient Operations:

With the recent appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, Starbucks is embracing fresh leadership with a strong track record. Coming from his success at Chipotle, Niccol’s commitment to improving service times, simplifying pricing, and streamlining operations brings a renewed sense of excitement. This fresh direction instills a sense of confidence in investors, assuring them that Starbucks is on the right path to growth.

1hvm77t_JNJ,JNJ,Starbucks or $5 a day in an ETF?  A plan for the rest of us.,"This is one for people without much money.  Like me.  I don't have a lot of income, so I need to be creative if I want to have money for the future.  

So, I started another journey in mid to late 2023.  Instead of spending $5 every day on a Starbucks Frapp, I invest that $5 every day (business day) into an ETF.  

You may laugh at $5 a day, but I'm going to use a Monte Carlo simulation to show you how much you get over time.

The details: 

\- initial investment of $150 (a little more than 1 share)

\- $5 a day for 20 years

\- All into HDV and dividends/capital gains are reinvested

\- Use Robinhood for no fees or charges

For the first ETF, I chose [HDV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HDV/): iShares High Dividend ETF.  HDV top holdings are Exxon-Mobile, Chevron, JNJ, AbbieVie, AT&T - all are good dividend payers, but not big growth stocks.  These are companies that spit out cash and dividends.  HDV pays a dividend yield of 3.28%, about triple the S&P 500.

The Monte Carlo results are attached but here is.a summary:

10th percentile: $69,552

25th: $81,456

50th: $96,919

75th: $115,825

90th: $135,854

For the patient investor, odds are good that you'll have $100,000 in 20 years.   All for $5 a day.

# Wall Street Upvotes Reddit

Reddit just scored its first profit ever, and Wall Street is buzzing.

The internet’s favorite forum reported Q3 revenue of $348.4 million, a 68% jump year-over-year that smashed expectations. Net income hit $29.9 million, a huge swing from last year’s $7.4 million loss. 

The big news sent Reddit shares soaring 42%, tripling its value since going public in March—a huge win for a platform known for everything from meme stocks to life hacks.

**The Ad Game and AI Boost**  
  
What’s fueling Reddit’s rise? A smarter ad strategy and a healthy dose of AI. New ad formats, video placements, and sports partnerships are finally converting Reddit’s huge traffic into ad dollars. 

Meanwhile, Reddit’s data has become gold in the AI world—Google and OpenAI now license Reddit’s data to train their AI models, helping drive “other revenue” up 547% to $33.2 million. CEO Steve Huffman credits these changes for turning Reddit into a profit machine.

**User Surge and Global Reach**  
  
The numbers show Reddit’s user base is growing, too. 

Daily active users jumped 47% year-over-year to 97.2 million, with a 70% spike in logged-out visitors. Reddit’s new AI-driven translation features are drawing international traffic by the millions, and Huffman plans to keep that momentum going by making it easier for visitors to create accounts. 

With Reddit posts also ranking higher in Google search results, its influence is clearly on the rise.

**More Than Just a Forum**  
  
From data licensing to international expansion, Reddit is no longer just the internet’s quirky corner—it’s a serious revenue contender. As its user base and ad revenue grow, Reddit’s steady pivot from niche to mainstream has turned it into a profitable force in social media. 

For a platform born from open-forum debates, that’s no small feat.

1gfw9p6_SBUX,SBUX,Starbucks CEO pledges to fundamentally change strategy as sales fall for third straight quarter,"Starbucks on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as sales in the U.S. and China, its two biggest markets, disappointed.

The company previously released a preliminary report of its quarterly results on Oct. 22 and announced it was suspending its fiscal 2025 outlook. 

This report marks the first under CEO Brian Niccol, who joined the company on Sept. 9 to revive the floundering business. 

“It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement. “We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth.”

Investors are expecting that Niccol will share more details about his turnaround strategy during the company’s conference call, scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.

Shares of the company fell 1% in extended trading on Wednesday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. $1.03 expected

Revenue: $9.07 billion vs. $9.36 billion expected

Starbucks reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, down from $1.22 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales dropped 3% to $9.07 billion. 

The company’s global same-store sales fell 7%, fueled by weak demand in the U.S. and China. Traffic to its stores worldwide fell 8% during the quarter.

The company’s U.S. restaurants reported same-store sales declines of 6%, fueled by a 10% tumble in traffic.

In China, the company’s same-store sales plummeted 14% as both traffic and average ticket fell. Starbucks has been facing greater competition from local rivals, like Luckin Coffee, which can undercut the company’s prices.

# Wall Street Upvotes Reddit

Reddit just scored its first profit ever, and Wall Street is buzzing.

The internet’s favorite forum reported Q3 revenue of $348.4 million, a 68% jump year-over-year that smashed expectations. Net income hit $29.9 million, a huge swing from last year’s $7.4 million loss. 

The big news sent Reddit shares soaring 42%, tripling its value since going public in March—a huge win for a platform known for everything from meme stocks to life hacks.

**The Ad Game and AI Boost**  
  
What’s fueling Reddit’s rise? A smarter ad strategy and a healthy dose of AI. New ad formats, video placements, and sports partnerships are finally converting Reddit’s huge traffic into ad dollars. 

Meanwhile, Reddit’s data has become gold in the AI world—Google and OpenAI now license Reddit’s data to train their AI models, helping drive “other revenue” up 547% to $33.2 million. CEO Steve Huffman credits these changes for turning Reddit into a profit machine.

**User Surge and Global Reach**  
  
The numbers show Reddit’s user base is growing, too. 

Daily active users jumped 47% year-over-year to 97.2 million, with a 70% spike in logged-out visitors. Reddit’s new AI-driven translation features are drawing international traffic by the millions, and Huffman plans to keep that momentum going by making it easier for visitors to create accounts. 

With Reddit posts also ranking higher in Google search results, its influence is clearly on the rise.

**More Than Just a Forum**  
  
From data licensing to international expansion, Reddit is no longer just the internet’s quirky corner—it’s a serious revenue contender. As its user base and ad revenue grow, Reddit’s steady pivot from niche to mainstream has turned it into a profitable force in social media. 

For a platform born from open-forum debates, that’s no small feat.

1fzs4mo_PATH,PATH,"Deep dive into Starbucks - Optimized for choice, not profit.","**1.0 Introduction**

Starbucks isn't just a coffee chain; it's a place where your drink comes with a version of your name on the cup. While this small detail doesn’t change the quality of the product, it has a big impact on customers:

1. **Personalization** - People naturally crave recognition, and this simple interaction taps into that need, making the experience feel more personal, even if it is just a name on a cap.
2. **Customer engagement** - Calling out names for orders, often with humorous misspellings, creates a memorable experience that extends beyond the store. Countless social media posts about these misspellings have gone viral, and this kind of engagement works to Starbucks' advantage.

The customer-centric culture is what allowed the company to grow to almost 40,000 locations worldwide (\~18,000 in the U.S.).



**2.0 The struggle**

Starbucks is perceived as a company with a strong brand.

***But is that true?***

***What does it mean?***

***What does a strong brand bring to the table?***

A strong brand has **pricing power**. It can charge premium prices and raise them in an inflationary environment, **without experiencing a decline in the quantity of products (or services) sold.**

The revenue formula for a company of this kind is simple:

**Revenue** = **Quantity of products sold** x **Price.**

Over the last decade, there have been some inflationary times.

Based on Finance Buzz, Starbucks increased the prices of their products by 39%, the lowest among the chains included in the research. This is slightly above the inflation rate, so it can be argued that the company managed to fully pass the costs to the final customer.

However, the second part of the equation was the **quantity.** A company with strong pricing power should not experience a decline in the amount of products (or services) sold. Unfortunately, this isn’t true for Starbucks.

The company has experienced lower revenue for two quarters in a row compared to the same quarters in the prior year. Their comparable store sales have decreased, meaning they **bring less revenue per store despite the price increase.** **This isn’t a characteristic of a company with a strong brand and pricing power.**

The CEO at the time, Laxman Narasimhan had a terrible CNBC appearance after the Q2 results. His explanation for the poor results was “***We didn’t communicate the value we provide***” - Which I find ridiculous. I don’t think the reason for the poor results is a lack of communication.

But, it gets worse. In the quarterly, release, there was a section related to the strategic priorities. The one that caught me by surprise was **“Become truly global”.** What does this even mean? Isn’t a company with \~40,000 locations “global” enough?



**3.0 The actual reasons for the struggle**

So, what is happening? **Why is Starbucks struggling?** While studying the company in depth, I’ve identified the following 4 reasons:

1. **More is not always better** - The menu continues to expand, offering more options and customizations. When the orders start shifting away from standard to customized, it leads to longer times to prepare a beverage. This leads to **fewer drinks** being prepared (and sold) per hour and **longer waiting times**. From a financial point of view, the cost per beverage goes up, and then it is passed on to the final customer. However, why should the customers pay more? What changed? For many, the waiting time increased. Ultimately, many customers (including loyal ones) decided that the current value for money offered by Starbucks wasn’t worth it, and looked for alternatives.
2. **China's competitive landscape** - As the second-largest market, it decreased a 14% in the latest quarter. The local rivals have been undercutting Starbucks in price.
3. **Mobile app disappointment** - Mobile orders account for roughly a third of Starbucks’ U.S. orders. This leads to a lot of customers simultaneously waiting for their orders, with overwhelmed baristas trying to keep up with it. However, there is also another psychological aspect. The total waiting time comprises **order time** & **preparation time.** Most customers remember “waiting” as the time between ***placing the order and receiving the beverage***. With mobile apps, the order is done without having to wait in line and although the total waiting time is the same, the preparation time is longer. Reducing the order time isn’t a benefit that stands out.
4. **Worsening reputation** - In 2021, employees started organizing and forming a labor union, motivated by concerns over workplace conditions, wages, unpredictable schedules, and overall job security. Starbucks has been accused of using aggressive tactics to prevent unionization, via anti-union messaging, store closures and firings, and even increased surveillance and intimidation. As of 2024, the company continues to face legal challenges from the NLRB (“National Labor Relations Board“) and ongoing unionization efforts.



**4.0 The solution (?)**

On August 13th, 2024, Starbucks announced that Brian Niccol has been appointed chairman and CEO of Starbucks, starting September 9th, 2024.

This is been seen as part of Elliott Management’s activist campaign.

**Brian Niccol is the 4th CEO of Starbucks in the last 3 years.**

The share price was up 24% on this announcement, which shows the market sentiment of this decision. Brian has been the CEO of Chipotle since 2018 and the CEO of Taco Bell before that. He has extensive experience in operations and is expected to bring new energy and ideas.

There will be plenty of similarities between his past roles and this one, especially focused on improving efficiency and cost-reduction, given his experience in digital improvement and online/mobile app ordering.

On September 10th, his 2nd official working day, he shared a letter to all partners, customers, and stakeholders with 4 key areas of focus:

1. **Empowering the baristas to take care of the customers**
2. **Get the morning right, every morning** by delivering outstanding drinks and food, on time, every time.
3. **Reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse** committing to elevate the in-store experience, ensuring the spaces reflect the sights, smells, and sounds that define Starbucks.
4. **Telling the Starbucks story**

In addition to this, he mentions that investments in technology are being made, to enhance the customer experience, improve the supply chain, and evolve the app and mobile ordering platform. His comment on China is that the company needs to *understand the potential path to capture growth and capitalize on its strengths in this dynamic market.*

He’s also addressing that in some places, especially in the U.S. the menus can feel overwhelming, the product is inconsistent, the wait is too long and the handoff too hectic.

In my opinion, this short letter of 2 pages, does a great job of addressing all the key challenges the company is facing (as outlined above).

Finally, there’s someone who takes responsibility, points out exactly what is going wrong, and not only hints at what is coming next but has experience in doing this before. To me, it seems that **Starbucks found the right person**.

This is also why if everything goes according to plan, he’s getting a compensation package above $100m.

But it is not going to be easy, nor fast. Changes of this kind will take time, especially given the size of the company. It would not be unreasonable to expect the first meaningful changes in 2-4 quarters.



**5.0 Valuation**

Given everything above, it doesn't come as a surprise that the company’s operating margin has decreased from 17% to 15% (over the last decade).

The company is still a cash machine bringing over $6 billion in cash from operations (with a limited Share-based compensation of \~$300m).

One of the key questions is - Given what is known today, how much is the company worth? I’ll give Brian the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he can implement the best automation tools to help baristas, get the menu under control, and bring the operating profitability to \~19%, which is optimistic.

At the same time, I’ll assume the growth will continue more or less at the same pace as the last few years but will be decelerating over time.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $99b **($88/share),** slightly below today’s share price of $96.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue in 10 years & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|15%|17%|19%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|79% ($65.3b)|$54|$65|$75|
|110% ($76.5b)|$63|$76|$88|
|126% ($82.4b)|$68|$81|$94|

Historically, Starbucks was always trading at a premium, as it was perceived as a company with strong brand and pricing power (hence, lower risk). I’d argue that right now, it doesn’t deserve that premium.

The market is already pricing a turnaround story.

1fzs4qx_PATH,PATH,"Deep dive into Starbucks - Optimized for choice, not profit.","**1.0 Introduction**

Starbucks isn't just a coffee chain; it's a place where your drink comes with a version of your name on the cup. While this small detail doesn’t change the quality of the product, it has a big impact on customers:

1. **Personalization** - People naturally crave recognition, and this simple interaction taps into that need, making the experience feel more personal, even if it is just a name on a cap.
2. **Customer engagement** - Calling out names for orders, often with humorous misspellings, creates a memorable experience that extends beyond the store. Countless social media posts about these misspellings have gone viral, and this kind of engagement works to Starbucks' advantage.

The customer-centric culture is what allowed the company to grow to almost 40,000 locations worldwide (\~18,000 in the U.S.).



**2.0 The struggle**

Starbucks is perceived as a company with a strong brand.

***But is that true?***

***What does it mean?***

***What does a strong brand bring to the table?***

A strong brand has **pricing power**. It can charge premium prices and raise them in an inflationary environment, **without experiencing a decline in the quantity of products (or services) sold.**

The revenue formula for a company of this kind is simple:

**Revenue** = **Quantity of products sold** x **Price.**

Over the last decade, there have been some inflationary times.

Based on Finance Buzz, Starbucks increased the prices of their products by 39%, the lowest among the chains included in the research. This is slightly above the inflation rate, so it can be argued that the company managed to fully pass the costs to the final customer.

However, the second part of the equation was the **quantity.** A company with strong pricing power should not experience a decline in the amount of products (or services) sold. Unfortunately, this isn’t true for Starbucks.

The company has experienced lower revenue for two quarters in a row compared to the same quarters in the prior year. Their comparable store sales have decreased, meaning they **bring less revenue per store despite the price increase.** **This isn’t a characteristic of a company with a strong brand and pricing power.**

The CEO at the time, Laxman Narasimhan had a terrible CNBC appearance after the Q2 results. His explanation for the poor results was “***We didn’t communicate the value we provide***” - Which I find ridiculous. I don’t think the reason for the poor results is a lack of communication.

But, it gets worse. In the quarterly, release, there was a section related to the strategic priorities. The one that caught me by surprise was **“Become truly global”.** What does this even mean? Isn’t a company with \~40,000 locations “global” enough?



**3.0 The actual reasons for the struggle**

So, what is happening? **Why is Starbucks struggling?** While studying the company in depth, I’ve identified the following 4 reasons:

1. **More is not always better** - The menu continues to expand, offering more options and customizations. When the orders start shifting away from standard to customized, it leads to longer times to prepare a beverage. This leads to **fewer drinks** being prepared (and sold) per hour and **longer waiting times**. From a financial point of view, the cost per beverage goes up, and then it is passed on to the final customer. However, why should the customers pay more? What changed? For many, the waiting time increased. Ultimately, many customers (including loyal ones) decided that the current value for money offered by Starbucks wasn’t worth it, and looked for alternatives.
2. **China's competitive landscape** - As the second-largest market, it decreased a 14% in the latest quarter. The local rivals have been undercutting Starbucks in price.
3. **Mobile app disappointment** - Mobile orders account for roughly a third of Starbucks’ U.S. orders. This leads to a lot of customers simultaneously waiting for their orders, with overwhelmed baristas trying to keep up with it. However, there is also another psychological aspect. The total waiting time comprises **order time** & **preparation time.** Most customers remember “waiting” as the time between ***placing the order and receiving the beverage***. With mobile apps, the order is done without having to wait in line and although the total waiting time is the same, the preparation time is longer. Reducing the order time isn’t a benefit that stands out.
4. **Worsening reputation** - In 2021, employees started organizing and forming a labor union, motivated by concerns over workplace conditions, wages, unpredictable schedules, and overall job security. Starbucks has been accused of using aggressive tactics to prevent unionization, via anti-union messaging, store closures and firings, and even increased surveillance and intimidation.

I wanted to share my investment thesis for $SBUX, one of my longest holdings. I initially sold my shares in 2021 near the top, but I’ve recently decided to buy back in with a focus on dividends.

Here’s why:

1. **Long-Term Confidence**: Starbucks has consistently shown strong performance and resilience over the years. Despite the recent volatility, I believe in their long-term growth potential.
2. **New Leadership**: The recent announcement of a new CEO from Chipotle has given me renewed confidence. Chipotle’s success under his leadership suggests he could bring valuable insights and strategies to Starbucks.
3. **Dividend Growth**: Starbucks has a solid track record of dividend payments and growth. With the current market conditions, I see this as an opportunity to lock in a good yield.
4. **Recent Price Surge**: Yesterday’s 24% increase in share price has brought me back to even after a nearly 20% loss for the year. This surge, driven by the CEO announcement, reinforces my belief in the company’s potential.

* The stock market basked in green on Tuesday, with indexes climbing higher as investors welcomed cooler-than-expected inflation data. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for July showed a modest 0.1% increase, offering some hope that inflation is cooling off. This comes just in time for Wednesday's much-anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Thursday's retail sales data, both of which are crucial for gauging the economy's health.
* Tech stocks led the rally, with the Nasdaq surging 2.43%, marking its best five-day streak since November. The S&P 500 wasn't far behind, adding 1.68%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up by 1.04%.

# Starbucks Taps Chipotle CEO to Brew Up a Turnaround

Starbucks ($SBUX) just swapped out its CEO like a barista switching out coffee beans. Laxman Narasimhan is out, and Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle ($CMG) chief, is in. Investors responded like they’d just had a double shot of espresso—sending Starbucks stock up a whopping 24.5%.

# From Burrito Bowls to Coffee Cups

Niccol is no stranger to turning things around. At Chipotle, he led a massive comeback after the food-safety scandals, transforming the burrito chain into a digital ordering powerhouse and boosting its stock by about 800%. Now, he’s trading guac for frappuccinos, with the challenge of revamping Starbucks’ sluggish sales and clunky operations.

# Brewing Up Big Changes

Starbucks has been struggling with long wait times and fewer customers, especially as inflation bites into coffee budgets. Narasimhan tried to caffeinate the company’s sales with higher-priced drinks and digital orders, but it backfired, leading to his abrupt exit. Enter Niccol, who’s expected to bring some of his Chipotle magic—think streamlined operations and a revamped digital experience that makes ordering and picking up your coffee as effortless as grabbing lunch on the go.

But it’s not all smooth sipping ahead. Niccol’s got to juggle the demands of activist investor Elliott Management and Starbucks’ not-so-retired founder, Howard Schultz, who’s still lingering like the smell of burnt coffee beans. His mission? To deliver on some more realistic goals, unlike the lofty ones Schultz set, which sent Narasimhan packing.

# Chipotle’s Loss, Starbucks’ Gain

Meanwhile, Chipotle’s stock took a hit, dropping 7.5% on fears that Niccol’s departure could shake up the burrito biz. But analysts are confident that the team Niccol built will keep Chipotle rolling.

So, should you bet on Starbucks? Wall Street seems to think so, with analysts upgrading their ratings faster than a barista pumps out pumpkin spice lattes. Niccol’s got the skills to grind out a Starbucks revival, but he’s got a tall order ahead. Stay tuned—it’s going to be a wild brew.

# CPI: The Fed’s Next Move Hangs in the Balance

Tomorrow’s CPI report is the main event everyone’s been waiting for—think of it as the Super Bowl for inflation watchers. With today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) coming in cooler than expected, all eyes are now on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to see if inflation continues to ease up. Economists are expecting a 0.2% bump in both the headline and core CPI readings, with year-over-year inflation holding steady at 3%. If those numbers hit, the Federal Reserve might finally be able to shift its focus from fighting inflation to tackling other economic challenges—like that pesky slowing labor market.

# What’s at Stake: A Green Light or a Roadblock?

Here’s why it matters: If CPI plays nice and comes in as predicted, it could be the green light for the Fed to start cutting interest rates, something Wall Street has been anxiously waiting for. The Fed has been in inflation-fighting mode for what feels like forever, but with the unemployment rate creeping up, there’s growing pressure for them to pivot. Jim Baird, Chief Investment Officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, put it simply: “Inflation is almost a nonissue at this point. There’s this broad expectation that the worst is easily behind us.”

But don’t pop the champagne just yet. If CPI surprises us by coming in hotter than expected, it could throw a wrench in the works and reignite those dreaded stagflation fears—a combo of rising prices and slowing economic growth that’s basically the financial equivalent of a horror movie. While some experts think stagflation fears are overblown, a surprise in the CPI could still send markets into a tailspin and force the Fed to rethink its next move.

# The Fed’s Next Move: Rate Cuts or More Tightening?

So, what’s at stake? A lot. Markets are already pricing in a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, but tomorrow’s CPI report could either seal the deal or flip the script. If inflation stays on the down-low, the Fed might finally be able to take its foot off the gas. But if prices start heating up again, well, we might be in for a bumpy ride.



# Home Depot’s Reality Check: Deferral Mode Activated

# 🛠️ By the Numbers:

* **Comparable Sales:** Down 3.3% (7th consecutive quarterly decline)
* **Revenue:** $43.18 billion (vs. $43.06 billion expected)
* **Earnings per Share:** $4.67 (vs. $4.52 expected)
* **Outlook:** Sales now expected to drop 3-4% this year (previously forecasted 1% decline)

Home Depot ($HD) is feeling the squeeze as consumers tighten their tool belts. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations for earnings and revenue, the home improvement titan had to cut its full-year sales forecast, blaming a “deferral mindset” among customers who are holding off on major projects until interest rates stop giving them heartburn. It turns out, people aren’t as eager to remodel their kitchens when borrowing costs are sky-high.

# Seven Quarters of Slumps—And Counting

Let’s talk numbers. Home Depot’s comparable sales have dipped for the seventh straight quarter, with a 3.3% decline this time around. Blame it on consumers who are spending less and waiting more. While pandemic lockdowns had everyone rushing to Home Depot to spruce up their spaces, today’s economic uncertainty has them second-guessing that new deck or bathroom redo. Instead, they’re opting for smaller, wallet-friendly projects—like painting a wall instead of tearing it down.

# Betting Big on the Long Game

But it’s not all doom and gloom. Home Depot is playing the long game, investing in its professional customer base and digital capabilities to weather the storm. The recent $18 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution, a supplier to professional contractors, is a big move in that direction. These pros are less likely to delay projects, making them a more reliable revenue stream. Plus, with investments in supply chain and digital infrastructure, Home Depot is setting itself up for future growth once the economy gets its groove back.

So, while the immediate future might look a little shaky, Home Depot is banking on a rebound—whenever that might be. In the meantime, they’ll keep hammering away at those long-term strategies.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the spotlight shifts to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the big brother of today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report.

CPI tracks the price changes of goods and services that hit your wallet directly. It’s a crucial gauge for the Federal Reserve as they monitor how their battle against inflation is shaping up. In June 2024, CPI climbed 3% year-over-year, following a 3.3% rise in May. For July, economists are betting on another 3% annual hike with a modest 0.2% increase from June.

Given the market’s volatility, a higher-than-expected CPI could trigger a wave of selling, while a lower number might spark investor enthusiasm, inching us closer to the Fed dialing back interest rates.

# Starbucks Taps Chipotle CEO to Brew Up a Turnaround

Starbucks ($SBUX) just swapped out its CEO like a barista switching out coffee beans. Laxman Narasimhan is out, and Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle ($CMG) chief, is in. Investors responded like they’d just had a double shot of espresso—sending Starbucks stock up a whopping 24.5%.

# From Burrito Bowls to Coffee Cups

Niccol is no stranger to turning things around. At Chipotle, he led a massive comeback after the food-safety scandals, transforming the burrito chain into a digital ordering powerhouse and boosting its stock by about 800%. Now, he’s trading guac for frappuccinos, with the challenge of revamping Starbucks’ sluggish sales and clunky operations.

# Brewing Up Big Changes

Starbucks has been struggling with long wait times and fewer customers, especially as inflation bites into coffee budgets. Narasimhan tried to caffeinate the company’s sales with higher-priced drinks and digital orders, but it backfired, leading to his abrupt exit. Enter Niccol, who’s expected to bring some of his Chipotle magic—think streamlined operations and a revamped digital experience that makes ordering and picking up your coffee as effortless as grabbing lunch on the go.

But it’s not all smooth sipping ahead. Niccol’s got to juggle the demands of activist investor Elliott Management and Starbucks’ not-so-retired founder, Howard Schultz, who’s still lingering like the smell of burnt coffee beans. His mission? To deliver on some more realistic goals, unlike the lofty ones Schultz set, which sent Narasimhan packing.

# Chipotle’s Loss, Starbucks’ Gain

Meanwhile, Chipotle’s stock took a hit, dropping 7.5% on fears that Niccol’s departure could shake up the burrito biz. But analysts are confident that the team Niccol built will keep Chipotle rolling.

So, should you bet on Starbucks? Wall Street seems to think so, with analysts upgrading their ratings faster than a barista pumps out pumpkin spice lattes. Niccol’s got the skills to grind out a Starbucks revival, but he’s got a tall order ahead. Stay tuned—it’s going to be a wild brew.

# CPI: The Fed’s Next Move Hangs in the Balance

Tomorrow’s CPI report is the main event everyone’s been waiting for—think of it as the Super Bowl for inflation watchers. With today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) coming in cooler than expected, all eyes are now on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to see if inflation continues to ease up. Economists are expecting a 0.2% bump in both the headline and core CPI readings, with year-over-year inflation holding steady at 3%. If those numbers hit, the Federal Reserve might finally be able to shift its focus from fighting inflation to tackling other economic challenges—like that pesky slowing labor market.

# What’s at Stake: A Green Light or a Roadblock?

Here’s why it matters: If CPI plays nice and comes in as predicted, it could be the green light for the Fed to start cutting interest rates, something Wall Street has been anxiously waiting for. The Fed has been in inflation-fighting mode for what feels like forever, but with the unemployment rate creeping up, there’s growing pressure for them to pivot. Jim Baird, Chief Investment Officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, put it simply: “Inflation is almost a nonissue at this point. There’s this broad expectation that the worst is easily behind us.”

But don’t pop the champagne just yet. If CPI surprises us by coming in hotter than expected, it could throw a wrench in the works and reignite those dreaded stagflation fears—a combo of rising prices and slowing economic growth that’s basically the financial equivalent of a horror movie. While some experts think stagflation fears are overblown, a surprise in the CPI could still send markets into a tailspin and force the Fed to rethink its next move.

The Journal—citing people familiar with the matter— [reported](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/activist-starboard-value-takes-stake-in-starbucks-ea0409e2?page=1) after the market closed on Friday that Starboard Value has taken a stake in the pumpkin spice latte maker, and hopes to help boost its stock price. The size of the stake wasn’t disclosed.

A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.

Starboard wouldn’t be the first activist investor to seek changes at the company. Starbucks confirmed on its latest earnings call that [Elliott Investment Management](https://www.barrons.com/articles/starbucks-stock-elliott-activist-e7a0a0c9?mod=article_inline) has acquired a stake. Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said on the call that ”our conversations to date have been constructive.”

Shares of Starbucks have fallen 22% so far this year through Friday’s close. The company reported a decline in earnings and revenue for its [fiscal third-quarter](https://www.barrons.com/articles/starbucks-earnings-stock-price-2c916cc9?mod=article_inline) on July 30, and noted that a “cautious consumer environment,” was impacting results.

“Our total company results were in line with guidance, but international performance, particularly in China, was challenged,” Narasimhan said on the earnings call. “We are not satisfied with the results, but our actions are making an impact.”",2024-08-12,7,1

1eg3bju_SBUX,SBUX,Starbucks revenue misses estimates as same-store sales decline for second quarter ,"Starbucks on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as both its U.S. and international cafes faced weaker demand.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted, meeting expectations

Revenue: $9.11 billion vs. $9.24 billion expected

The coffee giant reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $1.05 billion, or 93 cents per share, down from $1.14 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Starbucks earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales dropped 1% to $9.11 billion. The company’s same-store sales fell 3% in the quarter, fueled by a 5% decline in transactions.

Traffic to its U.S. stores fell again this quarter, dropping 6%. Domestic same-store sales fell 2%, boosted by an increase in average ticket. Last quarter, executives discussed plans to revive the lagging U.S. business that included leaning on discounts and new drinks to bring back customers who had abandoned the chain.

Outside of North America, same-store sales slid 7%. In China, Starbucks’ second-largest market, same-store sales tumbled 14% as both average ticket and transactions shrank. Starbucks has faced stiffer competition in China from local coffee shops that undercut the coffee giant on price.

Starbucks opened 526 net new stores in the fiscal quarter.

The company will discuss its outlook for fiscal 2024 on its upcoming conference call. Last quarter, Starbucks slashed its forecast, projecting revenue growth of a low single-digit percentage and earnings per share growth in a range of flat to a low single-digit percentage.

IMO, Starbucks is simply an established household name. There may be some competitors in the US and elsewhere, but everywhere I've ever been, Starbucks is immensely popular. The lone fact that so many people are willing to spend $5-6 on a daily cup of coffee makes me optimistic on the brand, given that quality homemade coffee comes in at mere cents per cup.

My thoughts are that it doesn't have much downside at the moment. It yields a 2.84% dividend, and on another note, they recently announced a boba drink. Personally, I'm bullish on boba after visiting Cambodia.'

1cjbp99_SBUX,SBUX,Is Starbucks SBUX an immediate BUY?,"SBUX shares dropped nearly 16% yesterday following their earnings release for fiscal Q2 which was worse than anticipated and marked a historically weak quarter. Starbucks was already in the Unfavored zone of the SIA S&P 100 Index Report and fell 7 more spots yesterday to the 100th ranking out of 103 investments. Starbucks has been in the Unfavored zone since June of last year and is down around -25% during this time period. 

US same-store sales dropped by 3% compared to an expectation of more than 1.2% as cautious consumer spending and a deteriorating economic environment weighed on customer traffic. Similarly, China experienced a decline of 11% in sales against an expected 2%. Operational margin stood at 12.8%, lower than the expected 14.4%, with EPS at $0.68 compared to the expected $0.80. Global revenue growth is pegged at low-single digits, compared with the previous guidance for a 7% to 10% gain. The retailer also forecasts global comparable store sales to be flat to down by low-single digits, compared with prior expectations for 4% to 6% growth. The company's long-term growth depends on several sales drivers and correcting some recent actions, as well as implementing cost efficiency measures according to analysts. Looking at a candlestick chart over the last five years using weekly time periods, we can see SBUX gap down significantly on the earnings miss yesterday marking the largest one week drop in this time frame. This has continued its recent trend downwards from its all-time highs from July of 2021 and its recent one year high from May of 2023. We could see support just below the $70 level based on previous lows from the spring of 2022 and past moves.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is currently in a column of 17 O's in a 2% Point and Figure chart which represents around a 35% drawdown while filtering out the short term noise. To the downside, support can now be found at around $70 and below this at $65.85 which corresponds to the lows from 2022 and the summer of 2020.",2024-05-03,4,60

Honestly I’m ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I’ve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who’s smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend’s Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you’ll have Tesla robotaxis.  You’ll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it’ll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That’s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that’s 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I’m buying this stock any price below $294.

Would this be a good play at the moment? 

Here is a brief overview: 

Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) is a well-known coffee retailer with a global presence. The company operates through three segments: North America, International, and Channel Development. Starbucks offers a variety of coffee and tea beverages, food products, and licensed merchandise under various brands.
In terms of financials, Starbucks has a market cap of $99.2 billion and a total enterprise value of $120.32 billion. The company's total revenues at $36.69 billion. When looking at profitability, Starbucks maintains healthy margins with a net profit margin of 11.7% and a return on total capital of 23.13%.
From a valuation perspective, Starbucks has a P/E ratio of 23.22 and a dividend yield of 2.44%. The company has shown consistent revenue growth over the years, with a 3-year CAGR of 16.55% and a 5-year CAGR of 7.73%.

1bssdvq_SBUX,SBUX,Starbucks Stock: Brewing Value? An Analysis.,"Regarding Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX), let's address the elephant in the room - the stock price. At $91.39, Starbucks is hovering near its 52-week low of $89.  
Over the past five years, the stock price for Starbucks is up 21%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 81%.  
One of the reasons behind Starbucks' lackluster performance is the departure of Howard Schultz as CEO in 2017. Schultz did make a brief comeback as CEO from 2022 to 2023, but even that couldn't save the sinking ship. Problems for the company continued, including labor disputes with unionized workers.  
Although the S&P 500 is up 10% in 2024, Starbucks is down 2.43%.  
Despite all the doom and gloom, Starbucks is still chugging along and even had record revenue recently. The company is still growing and making bank. I guess people can't resist their overpriced, yet oh-so-delicious, cups of joe. So, maybe there's hope for this caffeine-fueled empire after all?  
There might also be a light at the end of the tunnel with all of those labor disputes. Starbucks recently reached an agreement with the union on a foundational framework for collective bargaining. Progress, people!  
So, should you invest in Starbucks? The stock is trading near its 52-week low, and who doesn't love a good bargain, right? On the other hand, is Starbucks able to turn things around?  
Let’s examine the bull case and the bear case for Starbucks.  
**The Bull Case**  
Starbucks has experienced incredible growth. Just look at their Q1 consolidated net revenues, which soared to a record-breaking $9.4 billion. That's enough money to buy a lifetime supply of Frappuccinos.  
And the best part? They expect revenue to grow even more, with a projected increase of 7% to 10% this year.  
The stock also offers a decent dividend yield of 2.49%. That means you can sip your coffee while your investment pays you back in cold, hard cash. And if that's not enough to get you excited, their dividend has been slowly growing throughout the years.  
Now, let's talk about the price-to-earnings ratio, a key indicator of stock value. It's around 25 for Starbucks, which is pretty decent.  
Have you heard about Starbucks' spring menu? They've bloomed with their first-ever lavender drinks. With innovative offerings like this, Starbucks can find new ways to keep their customers hooked and their revenue flowing.  
But it's not just about the drinks. Starbucks is also shifting more of its marketing budget to social media to reach Gen Zers and millennials. They're tapping into the power of Instagram and TikTok to create buzz and build a loyal following.  
With record-breaking revenues, a growing dividend, and a marketing strategy that's as fresh as their coffee beans, Starbucks is brewing success in every cup.  


**The Bear Case**  
Hold on to your pumpkin spice latte because I've got some bearish news for you. First off, let's talk about their operating expenses. In the past year alone, Starbucks saw an 8.37% increase in operating expenses. This has held the stock back, partly explaining why it has lagged behind the broader market.  
In the most recent quarter, the earnings and revenue from Starbucks were lower than expected.  
Starbucks is facing fierce competition in its main market the United States, with rivals such as Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS). Plus, fast food players are now serving breakfast, which means Starbucks is battling some serious morning munchies competition.  
China, the second largest market for Starbucks, is experiencing some economic woes. There was a 9% decline in average ticket prices in China. And to top it off, comp growth (a key retail metric) in China is projected to be the worst for Starbucks worldwide in 2024.  
In the Middle East, there have been boycotts of the Starbucks brand over the recent war.  
With rising expenses, underperformance, fierce competition, economic troubles in China, and Middle East headwinds, it is clear that Starbucks has problems.  


**Comparing the Field**  
Starbucks’ stock price is $91.39 (-2.43% in 2024).  
And Starbucks’ competitors:  
Dutch Bros’ stock price is $33.00 (+6.25% in 2024).  
McDonald's stock price is $281.95 (-5.08% in 2024).  
Yum! Brands’ stock price is $138.65 (+7.46% in 2024).  
Restaurant Brands International's stock price is $79.00 (+1.94% in 2024).  
**From the Expert Analysts**  
According to the 25 Wall Street analysts documented by TipRanks, Starbucks has a price target of $107.30, which is higher than the current price. Among those 25 Wall Street analysts, 10 listed the stock as a “buy,” 0 listed it as a “sell,” and 15 listed the stock as a “hold.”  
According to analysts on Benzinga, Starbucks’ stock is listed as “neutral.” One bullish analyst predicts that the price could jump to $150 and a bearish analyst predicts that it could be as low as $86. The consensus price target among the analysts is $103.20.  


**Early Bird’s Flight Plan**  
If you prefer to invest in value stocks and/or dividend stocks with long-term aspirations, the price of Starbucks presents an opportunity to buy.  
However, if you prefer growth stocks and short-term trades, then Starbucks might be too risky due to volatility and headwinds.

1bph7qv_SBUX,SBUX,How can SBUX not be a long-term buy/hold?,"Near it's 52 week low, Starbucks stock might no longer be a growth phenom, but it's got to qualify as a blue chip value holding. And they'll pay you 2.5% to wait for it to go up. Payout rate a reasonable 57%.

I've traveled a lot in China and it seems there's no end to the cities of 5+ million residents where Starbucks becomes an addictive part of each white-collar worker's day. Company reported 20% adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2024's first quarter, so I don't think the expansion has run out of steam.

Downsides could be new and possibly cooler competitors and inflation pressures on that $6 cup of coffee.

Personally, I don't like Starbucks coffee and make my own. However, I'm happy to make money on the drink of the white collar masses. I see the stock now as quite similar to McD, similar PE and dividend, and no way either is going away any time soon.",2024-03-27,69,169
1afvzo6_SBUX,SBUX,Is Starbucks in trouble?,"**TLDR**: Most sources are aligned on boycotts having an impact on SBUX performance, some focusing on it more/less than others/attributing performance to other things. The real question is how long do we think the boycotts will last and does it make SBUX a bad investment medium term?  
**Sky News** reports boycotts being a contributing factor to its sales forecast being cut:

* Starbucks cut its yearly sales forecasts and missed market expectations
* The business was hit by staff walkouts and a dropping number of US occasional visitors
* Significant impact on traffic and sales in the Middle East due to the Israel-Hamas conflict
* Boycotts of the chain took place in the US
* Starbucks took legal action against Workers United for using its name and similar logo
* Protesters influenced by misrepresentation on social media
* Record revenue of $9.43bn was reported in its first 2024 fiscal quarter
* Sales outlook for the rest of the year was lowered as spending weakened in China and other markets

Had a quick scan on **NewsCord** to see what other publishers are saying and understand the longer-term impacts of boycotting on $SBUX:

* **RTE.ie** mentions that shares rose 4% after the bell, while Sky News reports that Starbucks cut its yearly sales forecasts and missed market expectations, indicating a more negative tone in the Sky News report
* **Quartz** portrays a different narrative by focusing on Starbucks reporting record revenue and lowering its sales outlook, while Sky News emphasizes the impact of staff walkouts, dropping number of US occasional visitors, and the Israel-Hamas conflict
* **MarketWatch**: Boycotts related to an ‘erroneous’ interpretation of SBUX’s stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were to blame.
* **MarketWatch**: Customers and others on social media have called for a boycott against Starbucks after the union representing some employees at the chain expressed solidarity with Palestine
* **MarketWatch** mentions that boycotts related to an ‘erroneous’ interpretation of SBUX’s stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were to blame, whereas Finbold does not cover this specific reason for the boycotts",2024-01-31,50,127

19aj7es_SBUX,SBUX,Starbucks(SBUX) DCF Analysis,"# Introduction:

SBUX has been gaining traction lately as a premium coffee experience from the United States. As the world gets richer, coffee consumption also grows ([SOURCE](https://www.dovepress.com/coffee-consumption-behavior-in-young-adults-exploring-motivations-freq-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-PRBM)). SBUX's expansive menu with constantly updated seasonal items creating a brand-new experience for customers, this novel experience hooks customers' curiosity and their wallets.  SBUX could even operate as a quasi-bank with their rewards app and prepaid cards that allow SBUX to essentially invest this cash without the traditional risk of a bank i.e. not having enough cash on hand when customers want to withdraw their cash in large droves. SBUX is even seen as a luxury item in China, allowing SBUX to charge a premium and succeed over their closest competitor.

# Revenue:

Overall, for revenue, I took into account how SBUX has to maintain its luxury good status and keep its prices elevated. This leaves SBUX room to expand mainly into wealthier countries. Management has stated that China has the largest potential, with China coming in second for the number of SBUX outlets opened ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/306915/countries-with-the-largest-number-of-starbucks-stores-worldwide/)).

When forecasting the number of stores open, as SBUX is seen as a luxury good this may limit its expansion into the different tier cities of China or to any less wealthy country. SBUX doesn’t compete on price but rather on the experience of coffee, so their strategy to grow revenue is unlikely to include price cutting.

As evidence of this, 86% of the stores SBUX operates in are in Tier 1 & 2 Cities in China. SBUX is only opening stores in prosperous cities in line with its brand image of being a premium brand. 

I assumed that in the earlier years of my forecast, the main growth came from SBUX expanding its footprints in wealthier countries. Thereafter, SBUX’s main growth driver comes from developing countries. Looking at the top 25 fastest developing countries GDP growth rate as of 2023 ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-fastest-growing-economies-world-140701215.html)). The Median is 6.20%, Average is 10.47%.   
  
When forecasting Revenue/Company Operated Stores, I assume that SBUX’s ability to generate revenue was in line with the macroenvironment. I assume that the macroenvironment takes 3 years to restart growth. As the macro conditions lighten up, SBUX begins having a larger ticket and transaction volume.  
  
When forecasting the Number of Licensed stores, I took into account the %of total stores that are owned directly by SBUX. This ratio remained consistent from FY19 to FY23 and this ratio is important as SBUX wants to maintain >50% control as a way of ensuring quality control globally through directly owning and operating the majority of operations of SBUX around the globe. The %begins tapering downwards over time as a better macro environment will encourage SBUX to pursue more aggressive growth plans through franchising.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/Licensed Stores, I assumed Y/Y growth as an average %of the historic rate before it begins to half as SBUX in recent years experienced large Y/Y growth from closing less profitable stores globally, and over time SBUX would figure out how best to monetize their licensed stores.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS and others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a %revenue based on historic averages.  
  
When forecasting store operating expenses, when SBUX increased its store count I assumed that there was some inefficiency that would get resolved over time, and on top of that as SBUX gets more efficient and franchise takes up a larger %of total store count, store operating expense which is a fixed cost begins declining.   
  
When forecasting G&A, SBUX tailors each store to cater to SBUX’s premium image. This image requires humans to upkeep, requiring human baristas to give the image of handcrafted coffee rather than a mechanized coffee machine that can be easily replicated and mass-produced. As evidence, when SBUX tried rolling out coffee machines to their stores it led to a decline in revenue as the SBUX experience was worsened. So, I assumed that G&A remains a %of historic averages for SBUX to maintain its minimum headcount for each store.

# CapEX and D&A:

When forecasting D&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted D&A as a %of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting CapEX, I accounted for how much %earnings SBUX had historically reinvested and their %ROIC. ([SOURCE](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ROIC/SBUX/ROIC-Percentage/SBUX)) Assuming that SBUX has a higher ROIC over time due to its improving brand premium and more profitable franchise arm.

# WACC:

# Conclusion:

In my base case, I value SBUX at $87.09 per share. I believe that SBUX is more or less correctly priced with some momentum carried over from them beating their earnings previous quarter. I believe that SBUX is a strong brand name. However, for consumables like coffee, the ability to reinvest back into R&D and differentiate themselves from competitors is rather limited. With factors such as taste and aesthetics being highly subjective to the consumer or even being similar to their competitors. SBUX's management recognises their limited ability to reinvest and create results, so instead of destroying value by forcing reinvestments, they have decided to pay it out as dividends instead. This limited ability to reinvest has led to SBUX being properly priced by the market.

Serving Up Wake-Up Jolts for Over 50 Years and Counting   


From its first humble shop in Seattle's Pike Place Market over 50 years ago, Starbucks has grown to become an indispensable supply line for caffeine and tasty treats across over 30,000 locations globally.

But it hasn't always been smooth sailing for the world's largest coffeehouse chain, especially amid a pandemic.

With a new CEO at the helm in Howard Schultz, Starbucks aims to regain its mojo by boosting worker benefits and morale while fending off resurgent unionization efforts.

At the same time, it strives to be the third place between home and work for millions and adapt its menu to changing consumer tastes and health trends.

Even as sales rebound post-lockdowns, can Starbucks rediscover the secret ingredients that made it a household name? We explore the company's ups and downs and whether it still packs the punch to energize your portfolio.

Starbucks Brews Up Steady Revenue Growth in 2022

Total net revenues climbed 12% or $3.7 billion. Growth largely driven by more sales from company-operated stores.

Company-operated store revenues rose on an 8% jump in comparable sales per store, thanks to higher average spending along with more customer visits.

Opening 1,339 net new company-run stores over the past year also boosted company revenues.

Licensed stores revenues grew as well, fueled by more sales of Starbucks products and equipment to licensees along with more royalty income.Other areas declined slightly, impacted by the 2021 sale of Evolution Fresh juices.

Revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance partnership rose.Foreign currency translation dampened some gains, though organic growth remained strong across both company and licensed stores.

The key takeaway is that Starbucks continued expanding its global retail presence while sales at existing stores also accelerated - driving steady high single-digit revenue expansion.

**Last Week –** SPY rose 3.9% last week, despite disappointing earnings (and gaps lower) in big cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, (Apple’s 7.5% move higher, bucked the trend and helped close the week on a high note). That SPY move higher followed a 5% rally the week before. It is now about 10% above the recent lows. QQQ was up about 2.2% on the week, underperforming the broader market and weighed down by those earnings reports. QQQ is now about 8% higher than its recent lows. The Dow is about 14% higher.

Volatility fell across the board, with the VIX now below 26, both because of the move higher but also with a huge percentage of the SPX market cap now having reported.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 26, its lowest levels since mid September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

The economic calendar this week features both the FOMC, where a 0.75 rate increase is expected, and the NFP jobs number to round out the week.

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 3% last week, following a similar move lower the week before. That move was slightly more than the 2.5% move options were pricing. Implied volatility was once again higher to finish the week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 3.1% move for the upcoming week (about $13 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week above 33, its highest levels since early March.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **3.1%** (+/- $13)
* QQQ **4%** (+/- $13)
* IWM **3.7%** (+/- $7)
* DIA **2.7%** (+/- $9)

### In the News

From last week’s preview:

>Tech and growth stocks weighed on the markets last week. The QQQ is approaching the lows the ETF saw in mid-March. IWM is already at the lows it saw several times this year. Some of the largest cap names in the QQQ report earnings this week and the reaction of the market to those reports will likely determine whether these levels hold.

Those levels did not hold and as the indices cracked implied volatility spiked. The market was led lower by stocks like Amazon, which was -14% on Friday following an unpleasant reaction to its earnings report on Thursday afternoon. Of the large companies to report, Meta and Microsoft were able to buck the trend and finished higher on the week. This week’s earnings aren’t large-cap market movers like last week, but they are reporting into an environment of very high market volatility, the highest of this earnings cycle (so far).

tmtrk8_SBUX,SBUX,Let's talk about SBUX,"Listen, all the other stocks talked about on here, cool, whatever they are nice sure, but what about Starbucks? We see this big price drop in the past 3 months due to the employees unionizing and striking and now some are getting approved. We can see the price of this stock going back to the 110-120 range in the next couple months.

Let me tell you why I feel this way:

1. Great atmosphere. The workers are always nice and im never waiting long for my nice cold delicious or hot drink.
2. They should market this more, but Starbucks actually has pretty good food, go order a sandwich or whatever it is you like from there today or tomorrow and tell me it's not decent food.
3. When the fricking heck you ever drive by a Starbucks and it's not got a line or people inside of it? They are always serving customers, which entails they are selling coffee/food which = profits $$

There are other reasons i could list but you can read it for yourself, Join the SBUX rally that is coming in the next couple months and make yourself some money.

(not financial advice, i'm just an ordinary idiot trying to make a point)

EDIT: Also if you haven' take a quick look at their menu, I think it's fairly priced, good tasting food that doesn't taste like chlorine pool cleaner? Fairly priced coffee that gets the job done? Sign me up",2022-03-24,6,62
ta6jlt_KO,KO,"McDonalds's, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Starbucks exit Russia","McDonald's which has come to symbolize Russia opening up to the West post-Soviet Union, announced Tuesday that they will be shuttering their 850 locations in Russia. Of these brands, it takes the biggest financial hit. 9% of its global revenue comes from Russia, and they will continue to pay the salaries of about 62,000 workers.

**In recent days**, Pepsi, Coke, McDonald’s and Starbucks have drawn criticism for continuing to operate in Russia while other U.S. companies backed out and paused sales.

* **Yale Professor** Jeffrey Sonnenfeld compiled and made public a list of U.S. companies that have withdrawn from Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion — and those that hadn’t. Until Tuesday afternoon, Coke was among the most recognizable names on the spreadsheet.
* **“Our hearts** are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” Coke said in a brief statement Tuesday afternoon. “We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve.”

Russia is one of the few places worldwide where PepsiCo has a larger presence. In a regulatory filing, Coke said its business in Ukraine and Russia contributed about 1% to 2% of its consolidated net operating revenue and operating income in 2021.

Pepsi has sold its cola in Russia for more than six decades, even when the company had to trade its soda concentrate for Stolichnaya vodka and warships. McDonald’s opened its first location beyond the Iron Curtain in Moscow months before the Soviet Union collapsed.

**Pepsi generates 4% of its annual revenue** in Russia. They will discontinue selling beverages, capital investments, and all advertising and promotional activities. They will keep selling some essential products, like baby formula, milk and baby food in the country.

**What they're saying:** “As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,” PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta wrote in a memo to employees viewed by CNBC.

* **The Wall Street Journal** reported earlier on Tuesday that Pepsi was weighing different options for its Russian business, including writing off its value. Economic sanctions have complicated the process of offloading Russian assets.
* **Yale’s Sonnenfeld** makes the case for companies ceasing operations in Russia Since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, many U.S. companies have looked to reduce their exposure in both Russia and Ukraine. Some restaurant chains, like McDonald’s, have sold off some of their company-owned locations to local franchisees.

**Starbucks** went a step further than McDonald’s, saying it would suspend all Russian business activity, including shipment of its products. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson condemned the attacks in a letter on Friday.

or2wym_SBUX,SBUX,SBUX massive earnings beat not priced in,"You may know me as the shitpost king and/or SPY $440 permabull who timed the recent Monday drop almost perfectly by buying puts the prior Thursday/Friday (can't remember which day).

After pretty much being glued to SPY for the last few weeks, I was feeling fatigued and went back to the oldest game in the book, buying risky calls going into an earnings print.

I am from the school of Peter Lynch - buy what you know.  After almost a year of staying at home and brewing my own coffee, I went to Starbucks for the first time in a long time (back in June) and found myself going back again and again.  The wait time was much shorter than I remember and every morning it was quite packed.  In true WSB fashion, I only got interested in SBUX after a massive move of 9.5% in a matter of 5 trading days on the back of a big CMG earnings print.

I debated writing this because I bought SBUX $130c 7/30 as a complete yolo and then found myself thinking about this more and more and realizing that the street may have sized this up wrong.  Is this confirmation bias for myself - maybe??

# Change in average ticket / Massive earnings beat

In Q2 2021, comparable store sales were up 9% quarter over quarter (Q2 2020).  Easy comps right?  Well, dig a little deeper and we see there was 10% DROP in transactions, but a 22% INCREASE in average ticket (total receipt/sale).  You might think this is some COVID anomaly, but increasing average ticket has been on a positive trend (increased 5% Q2 2020 over Q2 2019).  In the earnings, Starbucks attributed it to more group orders and the high / record 'food attach' (people buying overpriced sandwiches with their coffees).

Enter Mad Money interview, June 24, 2021 ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6XIujZgzg)).  **The CEO told Jim Cramer that the volume of transactions has hit an all time record and food attach remains high** (at a record? too lazy to listen to it for a 3rd time).

So to estimate this quarter's (Q3) EPS, I wanted to see what a normalized EPS would have been for Q2 2021 **if the volume of the transactions were flat vs Q2 2019**.

[Grossed up Q2 2021 EPS assuming no change in transactions since 2019 would have been $0.67](https://preview.redd.it/u9palqyln9d71.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=302c2b9e1273aafb42335388e715d57446ba91bf)

So 2021 vs 2019 should have seen a 24% increase in EPS all other things equal (obviously too hard to dissect the financial statements further than this oversimplification).

**What was Q3 2019 EPS?  $1.13.  Grossed up by 24%?**  **$1.40!!**

**Average Q3 2021 street estimate (Yahoo Finance)?  $0.77**

Usually, SBUX beats by about 10-20 cents.

# Chipotle Comparison

There has been a lot of chatter about SBUX rallying on CMG earnings and earnings are priced in.  I am not sure about this.  CMG is up 38% YTD and SBUX is only up 22%.  If you look at the SBUX chart, it hit $118 in April, then fell thru May and consolidated.  I think there is still a little left here for a move up - but honestly I have no idea and we know price action is fake basically all the time.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Higher average ticket price not priced in.  SBUX $130c 7/30 for a move up.

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.  THIS COULD BE TOTALLY DUMB.  I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.  BUY PUTS IF YOU MUST.

Edit: I think the average ticket thesis is the biggest factor, but there are some other tailwinds for this quarter that I thought were encouraging (supporting revenue trend)

I think I saw drive thru revenue coming in anywhere between 25-35 pct of revenue. 

Gasoline demand has been up all quarter. [link](https://twitter.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/1419289371241549828)

I recently was introduced to how to properly make use of a credit spread around earnings. It's the only viable options play I can come up with that ends up either being indifferent to IV crush or benefitting slightly from it. From what I understand you can also go deep ITM and survive the crush just fine as the closer your Delta gets to 1 the less effect it has on you. I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down. Correct me if I am wrong but straddles and strangles get crushed along with straight calls and puts, correct?

2) Plays
Based on past  moves and general market sentiment, especially predicted move base on option pricing, here are my thoughts on plays I'm hoping will print for next week. I appreciate all constructive feedback. Or even non constructive.

$TSLA DOWN 5%
$SBUX UP 3%

Or maybe a collaborative play on QQQ going down as a lot of the names I am interested in are tech companies.

Edit.. after some more DD I'm gonna throw $F in the ring for at Down 4%. This is based mostly on looking at big news items that effect collaborative stocks (Tsla, gm, nio, etc.).

o9fbi4_SBUX,SBUX,Starbucks Corporation - A Speculative Analysis (NYSE: SBUX),"# Introduction:

Welcome back to my weekly stock analysis. Disclaimer: I am not invested in this one

Starbucks Corporation (NYSE: SBUX)
Sector: Restaurants (Consumer Cyclical)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
SBUX is a multinational coffeehouse chain headquartered in Washington. They are part of the NASDAQ-100, S&P 100, and S&P 500. Starbucks is well known for its coffee, tea, and logo. In fact, if I recall correctly, Shrek 2 parodied Starbucks as Farbucks. 

Strengths:
- brand moat
- Very high dividend growth rate
- Many growth pivots

Risks:
- low yield (I know some of you care more for income than growth)
- Negative equity
- High valuations/Low returns

## Financial History and numbers

Starbucks is in a weird place to me. The PE ratio suggests that its overpriced, and the debt ratios scare me (I leave looking for why the equity went negative in December 2018 to the reader). The free cash flow per share does not concern me since this is a cyclical stock that survived the pandemic. There is a low return on investment, but the dividend growth rates are outstanding. Something is going on with SBUX and I want to find out what. To move along, though, I will use the 3 year dividend growth rate to project outwards.

### Why am I not invested?
For one, the order process is sub-optimal to me. I feel like there is missing efficiency somewhere in the barista line. For another thing, the US may just have enough Starbucks. I don't know if international expansion will work out like with MCD. The final reason is simply that I had too many picks in my discretionary sector. I liked MCD more at the time. Owning what may as well be a reit seemed more appealing at the time. Even so, I do think SBUX has some good moves to be made.

## Final Thoughts:
Starbucks has a couple of pivots that could grow their revenue. For one, Starbucks has its secret menu. From the [Unicorn Frappuccino](https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/1492533200-unicorn-frappuccino-1492513921_2.jpg) to the ferrero rocher drink, SBUX has remained hip through its mix ins and customization. This is great since people love “exclusivity”. The rewards card must also help too. Getting food and a drink to go with it helps. If only it had avocado toast. [Oh wait it does…](https://www.starbucks.com/menu/product/2122257/single?parent=%2Ffood%2Fhot-breakfast%2Fbreakfast-sandwiches-and-wraps)

Another pivot that Starbucks can potentially take is incorporating boba (bubble tea) into its menu. Starbucks already serves tea. If they can make good boba, I am certain that people would flock. They already make great money selling addicting substances. Why not sell the other addicting drink?

In 2018, Starbucks announced its use of the blockchain to show the process from bean to cup. I do not know where this ended up but with the popularity of cryptocurrency, I can only imagine how well a NFT or Starbuckscoin would do. Starbucks already seems to be taking payment via cryptocurrency. 

Weekly price estimate for a future date, via consulting the crystal ball:
Predicted price for SBUX for Dec 19, 2021: $122.33. There is no factual basis that I will give.

They have about 1.1 billion in outstanding shares. They’ve practically done 100mil stock buybacks every year since 2016. Consensus EPS forecast is -.6 for earnings scheduled 7/28.  

They issued a dividend in May at .41/share. That’s approximately 450million in preferred dividends. So we’re looking at Net Income of about -600M.  

So analysts are predicting, that for a whole quarter filled with stay at home orders, store closures (400 in US), and modified consumer behavior (Karen makes her own coffee via a French press now). Sbux is only -600M in Net Income?   


Think of where their stores are located. Time Square, CIA Langley, Seattle Pike Place, Shibuya Crossing. Imagine the rent on these places. Imagine the people who would normally buy there who will NOT buy anymore. It’s not only the double shot chai soy skinny latte sales, but Mugs, accessories, food and etc.   



Let’s look at Expenses. CAPEX for $SBUX is $1.7B for a year. Let’s say we break it down evenly by quarter. So SBUX Capital expenses per quarter is 425M. Sure they furloughed workers to reduce Operating Expenses but their last quarterly report their Operating Cash Flow was $-1.3B. They had to issue Debt in the amount of $2.3B just to end up with Cash reserves of $2.5B.  


TLDR: COVID19, No Revenue, Large Debt and Accounts Payable, Stock Buybacks, Store Closures, Consumer behavior all points to a bear case.

emed5f_SBUX,SBUX,SBUX 2/21 $95C Is A Buy,"Apart from the recent upgrades by Barclay to $107, there should be great upside to the stock in the coming months. The current price of the $95C for 2/21 are all 0.90-0.95, speculating an upside of just 5% from it's current levels. I added to my position today with 20 calls for the above option.

Current state of affairs:

Starbucks has been going through management changes over the last year to ensure that both the staff and management teams are properly trained after the racist blunder that occurred last year. Since then, Starbucks has gained a strong reputation for their service.

On the financial side of things, Starbucks has had a 10% year-over-year growth since 2016. This year, they are set to report -4% revenue compared to last year as a result of the China expansion and headwinds from the geopolitical shit storm between the US/China. Nonetheless, analyst believe that Starbucks will continue to grow as it has owns a large proportion of marketshare in this space with only few serious competitors like LK. Cashflow as of now is in the ballpark of $5B, with about 3B leveraged at the moment. As per the marketcap, they are at \~107B, with revenues sitting in the 26B range. They are only trading 4 times their revenue which makes this stock relatively affordable for a food/drinks related industry.

I presume that in this coming year, when the second phase of the trade talks are signed (Jan 15), the market will readjust and Starbucks will be aligned for meeting it's high (which currently is about 9% shy of the top). ER should be a beat and guidance should be raised with the addition of 2,000 stores world wide, and an average ROI of 70% in the 2018 fiscal year for the Chinese franchises and 50% ROI for domestic locations. 

On the options side of things, there is a lot of interest in the $90-100 Call range between 1/17-2/21 expiration. As of today, the short interest volume sits at 635k vs. total volume of 7.3 million (relatively low, but not a cause for concern).

There is plenty of room to run boys. Let's get out there with some fire plays, buy some of that Starbucks Coffee, and make those fire posts mid January.

3. I'm thinking of getting on the bandwagon now, but I'm scared to over-pay! On Sept 20 2019 its P/E was [33.29](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SBUX/starbucks/pe-ratio).

It sure seems too good to be true and now I think a correction might be in order.  I don't fully understand the forces causing it's meteoric rise.  It's a great company with ethics and a strong growth trend and a strong balance sheet.  Still I argue the stock valuation is going up too fast.   

&#x200B;

In addition to being a restaurant company, SBUX manages a large international distribution network that could be adversely affected by tariffs, embargos, etc.  Add to that, it's a pleasure commodity.  In other words, we people run out of cash to spare, The daily mocha is one of the first frivolous expenses to get cut, so any economic down turn can have an 'amplified' affect to sales.

Shares of Starbucks slumped as much as 4% after-hours following the company's first quarter earnings report that beat analysts' earnigs-per-share expectations but fell short on revenue.

The coffee giant said it earned an adjusted $0.65 cents per share — 14% above the expected $0.57 — on revenues of $6.073 billion. Analysts had expected $6.2 billion.

""Starbucks reported another quarter of record financial results in Q1 of fiscal 2018, with consolidated revenues up 6% over last year - up 7% excluding 1% for the impact of streamlining activities in the quarter. China grew revenues 30% in Q1, with the strategic acquisition of East China positioning us to accelerate our growth in the key China market,” said CEO Kevin Johnson in a press release.

""Today, Starbucks has two powerful, independent but complementary engines driving our global growth, the U.S. and China. Our work to streamline the company is sharpening our focus on our core operating priorities.""

Same-store sales, a metric that Wall Street is paying careful attention to as the 27,000+ store chain nears maximum expansion in the US, was up 2%. The company had forecast 3-5% growth this year. 

""We are concerned SBUX's same store sales could worsen until new store growth slows and in-store capacity constraints are addressed,"" UBS analyst Jason West said in a note to clients last week. 

Stabucks is now looking to other areas for continues growth, specifically China.

""We are laser-focused on accelerating growth in China and driving improvement across the U.S. business as we move into and through the back half of the year,"" CFO Scott Maw said in a press release. 

Wall Street analysts remain bullish on the stock, and have a consensus price target of $64 — 6%  above where shares opened Thursday. 

Shares of Starbucks have severely lagged behind the S&P 500 benchmark in the past year, rising just 3.6% compared to the index's 23% gain. ",2018-01-25,6,7

## Competition

From their SEC filing

> Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops and quick-service restaurants. In almost all markets in which we do business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the U.S. quick-service restaurant sector and the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to well-established companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.

It's impressive that their sales are now in reaching distance of McDonald's! Similarly margins are really impressive.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $66.33 price target for Starbucks and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 15% to their target.

# Valuation

Its impressive growth is clearly reflected in the price at 31x earnings and just 1% dividend yield. Am pretty flabbergasted that it's hard to find any of these stocks trading less than 20x.

# Dividends

Starbucks Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.81 per share. The forecast dividend of $0.81 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.89. and there is a generous buyback too

> We returned $2.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 3% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. That's against a backdrop of sales up 10% in the 9 months to end June.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/sbux/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.
> We now expect global comp growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. 

and

> Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest markets such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance.

So the world's demand for coffee, Starbucks coffee, is showing no signs of abating. Coffee prices have helped recently. The company is investing in loyalty programs and apps to increase repeat visits. 

So, there don't seem to be any clouds on the horizon. But as a result, you have to pay up for $SBUX.

I recall my last trip to Beijing  Starbucks were everywhere and all of them were crowded to a certain extent.  

Starbucks plans on opening like 4k more stores by 2016 in China.  I've been incredibly lucky in the market the last few years but never through analytical research just gut feelings...


I've been right on AAPL, COST, PFE, V, MA, and NFLX, and sort of wrong on BABA... I didnt get out when I should have...

anyways I have that same feeling with SBUX.  I know its trading at a premium what's a good entry point and do you think this bullshit race nonsense will blow over?  Also the stock split get in before or after?  ANything I should be worried about with SBUX?

Thanks in advance.

Oh yeah I was recently in Canada recently and noticed the starbucks were rammed.  How is starbucks image in America?  Is it still a popular place?

I kind of feel like Mcdonalds took a dive because of the health craze and all the videos of black mob violence happening in Mcdonalds.  And tim hortons took a dive because of all the riff raff that just tend to loiter there and smoke weed.

Check out Page 10 of Howard Shultz's Presentation to Shareholders during Starbucks' Annual Meeting.,"Recently, I have been considering buying some more Starbucks as their share price is down lately.  Through my DD process, I found an interesting info-graphic in Howard Shultz's presentation to shareholders during their annual meeting.

On Page 10 of the presentation it shows the companies in the S&P/NASDAQ with market caps greater than $50 billion that grow EPS @ greater than 15% per year.  There are only 13, I am happy to say I own shares in 5 of them. Here they are in no particular order:

* Priceline (PCLN)
* Gilead (GILD) 
* Baidu (BIDU)
* Facebook (FB)
* Visa (V)
* EOG Resources (EOG)
* Starbucks (SBUX)
* Amazon (AMZN)
* Google (GOOGL)
* Celegene (CELG)
* MasterCard (MA)
* Biogen Idec. (BIIB)
* One Other Company That is Not Listed

Currently, I have positions in GILD, V, BIIB, GOOGL, SBUX and have been watching/researching PCLN, FB, and EOG.

March 9 (Reuters) - A heavy burst of bearish option action in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc in the hours before Starbucks announced plans to launch a single-cup coffee and espresso brewer has raised eyebrows among some option market participants.

Option bets on a big move up in Starbucks shares and on a sharp drop in Green Mountain stock preceded the news.

""The level of aggressiveness that traders early on Thursday came for Green Mountain March downside puts was very suspicious,"" said Alan Thompson, options market maker at Timber Hill, a division of Interactive Brokers Group. ""It raised our eyebrows.""

The put buying in Green Mountain ""was off the charts into last night's announcement,"" said Jon Najarian, a co-founder of online brokerage TradeMonster in Chicago, who also noticed very strong buying of upside calls in Starbucks on Wednesday.",2012-03-10,5,3
