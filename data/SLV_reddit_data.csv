qv7kme_SLV,SLV,SLV & SH options Jan. 2023,"Dears,

I'm very interested to go long with Silver and short with S&P500 for the next year.

Before i place my orders, i would like to have your advice so i do not mess with this trade.  
My strategy is to open a credit spread for both assets with expiration date around Jan. 2023.  


Except the risk of loss (im mainly using optionsprofitcalculator to calculate the maximum loss), what should i consider to go with this type of options for longer then 1 year ?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance,

mbx510_SLV,SLV,"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years"," WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.

Think about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**

I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren‚Äôt. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out:

&#x200B;

[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.

For example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

https://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).

For further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e

You‚Äôll notice that as long as futures investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.

And lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

https://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.

This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.

After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?

Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.

Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.

https://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.

https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That‚Äôs how tight this market is.

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f

It looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.

April‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.

Here‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:

https://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkh2bdfxhwo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2bf46c9b547b8e0b0cfe109639ad283a832e7

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell.

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.

In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.

But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?

There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.

I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.

Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.

So what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô?

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

I in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

https://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).

The other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

https://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.

**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**

If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.

Disclaimer: I am a random guy on the internet and this entire post should be regarded as my personal opinion",2021-03-24,24632,2477
mbx510_PATH,PATH,"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years"," WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.

Think about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**

I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren‚Äôt. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out:

&#x200B;

[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.

For example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

https://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).

For further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e

You‚Äôll notice that as long as futures investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.

And lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

https://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.

This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.

After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?

Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.

Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.

https://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.

https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That‚Äôs how tight this market is.

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f

It looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.

April‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.

Here‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell.

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.

In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.

But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?

There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.

I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.

Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.

So what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô?

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16

I in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

https://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).

The other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

https://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**

If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.

Disclaimer: I am a random guy on the internet and this entire post should be regarded as my personal opinion",2021-03-24,24639,2477
mbx510_JPM,JPM,"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years"," WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.

Think about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**

I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren‚Äôt. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out:

&#x200B;

[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.

For example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

https://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).

For further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e

You‚Äôll notice that as long as futures investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.

And lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

https://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.

This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.

After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?

Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.

Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.

https://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.

https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That‚Äôs how tight this market is.

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f

It looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.

April‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.

Here‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:

https://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkh2bdfxhwo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2bf46c9b547b8e0b0cfe109639ad283a832e7

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell.

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.

In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.

But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?

There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.

I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.

Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.

So what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô?

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16

I in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

https://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).

The other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

https://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.

**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**

If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.

Disclaimer: I am a random guy on the internet and this entire post should be regarded as my personal opinion",2021-03-24,24639,2477
mbx510_UPS,UPS,"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years"," WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.

Think about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**

I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren‚Äôt. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out:

&#x200B;

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.

For example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

https://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).

For further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e

You‚Äôll notice that as long as futures investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.

And lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

https://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.

This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.

After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?

Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.

Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.

https://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.

https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That‚Äôs how tight this market is.

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f

It looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.

April‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.

Here‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:

https://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkh2bdfxhwo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2bf46c9b547b8e0b0cfe109639ad283a832e7

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell.

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.

In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.

But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?

There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.

I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.

Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.

So what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô?

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16

I in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

https://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).

The other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.

**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**

If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.

liducu_SLV,SLV,SLV for Silver trades..... What I see and how it can and will go up... If you are looking to make a move... This is an idea for you. The REAL SQUEEZE!,"  

This is not a pump and dump scheme. It is smart money. I have been a coin dealer and in all of my 20 years dealing in rare coins and bullion I have never seen anything like this. The biggest indicator is when the premiums on physical silver coins and bars are way up! Presently dealers at the coin show I am doing are asking anywhere from Spot Silver price + 8-9.00 over spot because of the long back orders from high demand for Physical Silver. I have seen this even crossover onto eBay, and the Facebook coin groups with the premiums. The demand for physical silver is so much that even the Perth Mint temporarily last week stopped minting silver bars. 

[The Silver Squeeze..... Will we get to $50](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-02-09/Is-there-enough-silver-The-real-story-in-silver-is-the-physical-squeeze.html) take a read‚Ä¶. This is not a drill. [r/wallstreetbets](/r/wallstreetbets) hasn't even mentioned much on this since last week. It is practically going noticed. 

The easiest way into Silver is to buy SLV (iShares Silver Trust) as it has support levels at or around the $25.00 level with Higher highs showing in the chart which if you look at the trends is poised to take off along with Physical silver. 

For Options, the prime targets are for March 12 and March 19 for $25.00 calls. The reason I mention this again is because of trends in the charts and the fact that physical silver is in demand not only for collectors, but investors as a hedge against inflation. We will end up seeing great inflation this year due to any stimulus checks that are going to be printed. Afterall the consequence of printing more money when the checking account is empty means a weaker dollar and costs going, and GDP going down. I encourage you do to your own research, as this is not financial advice, and I am not liable for any losses. I am not your JG Wentworth retards‚Ä¶.

Kenny at the playground sold you 100 popsicle sticks at a markup of 10x for your school craft project because he stole them all from art supply closet..... no one likes Kenny. So you say hey you know what.... I‚Äôm gonna take these 100 popsicles and cut them all in half and now you have 200 popsicles and you resell them to Jennifer who really needs to get an A in class. Except Jennifer goes out and buys her own popsicles from store..... and the stores are saying they have at least 900 popsicles ready to go.... so Jennifer says I want 300.... but now the stores say hey.... we really only had 100 and Kenny just bought the last 100.... so now the popsicles are all
Gone! 

NO ONE HAS POPSICLES. So now Kenny can go sell them for as much as he wants because supply States so. 

In summary it takes us to buy the popsicles(physical silver) first in order to reveal behind the curtain that the stores (banks) don‚Äôt actually have as many popsicles as they say they do... therefore $SLV squooozeeees and we are all happy",2021-02-07,0,123

As of end of the day yesterday (02/05) its trading at $0.90 each and therefore I am -$2500 on this position. It stings to do such a silly trade (as it rightly should so i use more discipline next time). I see two ways forward:

1. Close it now and live with -$2500 loss
2. Wait it out till end of Feb to see if $SLV moves up, theta decay will speed up after that i guess

ladv10_GLD,GLD,"FYI: If you make a sh**ton of money on SLV, GLD, PPLT or other precious metals ETF you pay a sh**ton of taxes because precious metals have a special tax rate","I'm wondering whether many ppl know this because I didn't for a long time but if you make a shitton of money on precious metals, whether they're coins, bars, or ETFs, you pay the highest tax rate on the gains, the ""collectibles"" tax rate. It's how the US government discourages people from hoarding precious metals. 

The tax rate depends on your tax bracket, but it can be twice as high as the regular capital gains tax rate. For example, for a short term (less than 1 year) held precious metal, the tax rate is massive. 

The tax rate on gains also depends on how the precious metals ETF is structured, but there are plenty of articles like [this one](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/how-are-commodity-etfs-taxed) online.

For this reason, I stopped investing in precious metals except for in tax free retirement accounts. It depends on tax bracket but imagine having to pay 40% of your gains to taxes. I don't know everyone's individual situations but it's just not worth it to me.

With all this SLV campaigning going on, I don't see anyone telling people they'll have to pay taxes out the ass if they make gains with SLV

Edit: [This article discusses SLV ETF in particular](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/youll-pay-more-in-capital-gains-for-these-types-of-etfs-2015-06-22)

> The two most-popular precious metal ETFs are the SPDR Gold Trust, GLD, and the iShares Silver Trust. SLV. Both are organized as grantor trusts.

> Unfortunately, the IRS has ruled that precious metal ETFs organized as grantor trusts are taxed the same as collectibles. As such, long-term capital gains from selling these ETF shares are subject to a maximum individual federal income tax rate of 28% instead of the standard 20% maximum rate. (Source: IRS Private Letter Rulings 200732026 and 200732027.) Finally, be aware that the dreaded 3.8% net investment income tax can also apply to gains from selling ETF shares. That can raise the maximum effective federal rate on long-term gains from precious metal ETFs to 31.8% (28% + 3.8%) for higher-income folks.

A lot of wealthy people have big positions in precious metals right now without worrying of high-taxes because they use those positions as a safe haven in case of crash, so they're avoiding big downsides, and so there's not a real focus on of investing for high gains. They're not expecting to make high-tax gains out of the positions. That's why all this noise about Citadel making a heavy investment run with SLV doesn't make sense to me and smells like misinformation.",2021-02-01,123,35

They create a short ladder attack on GME, tricking the system to make it look like there's a huge sell off which then pushes the stock down and at the same time have the medias do their job. These guys are so desperate that they even bought an ad on reddit to promote buying SLV. This is blatant manipulation and what they're doing is ILLEGAL. These fuckers try to cry about reddit ""manipulating"" the market into buying GME and look at what these fuckers are doing. Fucking criminals.  

If you buy into SLV, you're a weak small minded individual that clearly can't see a blatant manipulation happening right in front of your eyes. Yes, you will see some movement in SLV go up by a small amount but that's what they WANT you to see. HFT and HF aren't fucking around when it comes to this and they been manipulating the market for years. It's easy for them because they understand mass market psychology better than anyone and have done this for decades. This is EXACTLY WHY they control the market. They can make it move the way they want and don't underestimate them either. They aren't a bunch of idiots. They didn't pull billions out of their ass. They're rich as fuck for a reason but everyone needs to understand this and fight against it. Yes, it may be an impossible battle because this simply matters on who has the most money so for one individual or a handful, it won't be possible but against thousands, millions of people together, it's easily possible to win and that's what they're scared about.

**OBLIGATORY - $GMEüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ (YES THAT IS 7 ROCKET EMOJIS SO YOU KNOW IM DAMN SERIOUS).**

It‚Äôs ya boy here, ElJefe and boyyyyyy do I have something to share with you!

Hold onto your seats, because what I‚Äôm about to share IS a doozy and it might help make a lot of connections with what the fuck is going on related to this whole GME fiasco, that is now turning into some chance opportunity for $SLV to return to the main stage as another **‚Äúsqueeze opportunity‚Äù.**

Listen we all should know by now that the news we are shown is mostly used to control a narrative for a certain group and this is **NO DIFFERENT OF A TIME**.  The thing that is so unique with this situation is how intertwined things are more than you are lead to believe. 

Does anyone find it amazing that 1 company Robinhood) was able capture the attention of millions upon millions of NEW retail investors by simply creating an app that is understandable and is easy to use? Think of it, Robinhood opened the door to change people‚Äôs lives by guiding them through the transaction process for stocks and people started to open their eyes and realize that making money to sustain your life doesn‚Äôt need to take a whole bunch of your time away from you. 

So here is where the story begins.

Robinhood as many of you know was **heavily** funded by a Market Maker that is known as Citadel (previously Wellington management, which was founded in 1933 by Walter L. **Morgan**(weird coincidence, but maybe popular name in the day üôÉ) as the first balanced mutual fund).

Citadel not only is a market maker, but they also are the providers of a certain component of the transaction process known as immediate or cancel interface. Check out ‚ÄúCitadel Connect‚Äù - which essentially is known for the immediate or cancel interface that is baked directly into the transaction process for Brokerages. So they have their hand in a lot of cookie jars across brokerages, to say the least. They also provide a system of algorithmic trading that helps automatic trading for their clients and more! Check out their website, it is eye opening the power this single company really has over the exchange. 

Now keep in mind from before, Citadel gave Robinhood a **SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY** to get them going because they saw a huge opportunity with having **MORE** retail traders joining the party and that opportunity was **DATA**. Citadel has instant and live trading data access to every single trade you make (hence why you usually notice an immediate opposing force from the stock you are buying - buy call and stock goes down right away, buy put and stock goes up right away), this is not something you are imagining, Citadels algorithm is literally taking this data in real time, and placing the most favorable trade for Citadel, which usually starts mind fucking you with your position right off the bat. Remember emotional trading will always lose, and they fuck with your emotions IMMEDIATELY (usually).

So Robinhood ‚Äî> Citadel.

Next is JP Morgan. The banker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up. A *Morgan* started the original Citadel (Wellington), remember? Seems like a killer coincidence! Is Walter somehow related to John Pierpont? Even if indirectly, they bare the same family name... hmmm weird, but I can‚Äôt seem to find any relation on good old Google! So we‚Äôll leave this just as a coincidence. 

Back to JP Morgan - they would be the next in line to pay up or default and they are fully aware of the immensity of an infinite squeeze and now are in a position where they would be ones losing huge amounts of money. They have a lot of smart people working for them that quickly caught onto this and starting creating a contingency plan of some kind of to recoup some of the losses they are about to experience.

**This is where $SLV/Silver comes into play and WHY YOU ARE SEEING IT POP UP MORE FREQUENTLY.**

For those who unaware, $SLV is the ishares Silver Trust (which is blackrock‚Äôs silver etf). The silver squeeze **IS** something to have happened before and guess who was able to benefit **SIGNIFICANTLY** off of the sell off of the last $SLV rally... JP Morgan. How‚Äôd they do this? **They shorted the fuck out of it.** Check out JP Morgan‚Äôs history with the precious metals market - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html. They paid, but still made out like bandits with profits. 

Weird how when JP Morgan is about to lose a metric fuck ton of money, $SLV all of a sudden becomes ‚Äúviral‚Äù and we start seeing it popping up everywhere as the ‚Äúnext squeeze‚Äù, but maybe just a coincidence, right? 

Recap Robinhood ‚Äî> Citadel ‚Äî> JP Morgan would be the defaulted order. JP Morgan will need to recoup losses somehow, and what better way then A short on Silver whilst writing options during the run up?

Hence why $SLV has became viral.

So in essence. Stay the fuck away from Silver stocks unless you really know what you‚Äôre doing. Our mission is to focus on üíéü§≤üèªing GME. **EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEING** ***SHILLED*** **IS A DISTRACTION**. 



Also, Citadel should be another entity we are burning at the stake, not just Robinhood. Citadel is pulling off the greatest heist in history and the rest of the hedgies are just benefiting from this fiasco.

l8xaik_SLV,SLV,Think twice before investing in $SLV,"SLV saw an inflow of almost one billions dollars on Friday, which is nearly double that of the last record. There are large banks currently naked shorting silver on the futures markets one of them is JP Morgan. It is essential to understand that there is an interest in suppressing the price of silver as every increase undermines the confidence in the U.S. Dollar. 

What is essential to know about SLV is the following: 

> The sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc. (‚ÄúBlackRock‚Äù). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the ‚ÄúTrustee‚Äù) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase
Bank N.A., London branch (the ‚ÄúCustodian‚Äù). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any
officers, directors or employees.

The same bank that is heavily shorting silver is the custodian of $SLV.  The last time someone tried to increase the price of silver the FED created a special rule to fuck them. The two speculators that tried and successfully (for a time) controlled the majority of silver were billionaires even before their action in the silver markets. After the intervention from the FED, they went broke, billionaires going broke isn't something you hear often. 

Be sure that you know what you are getting into and do not use money that you cannot afford to lose. If you think you can compete against the largest banks in the nation and the FED you are wrong. The price might go up for a time but the crash will be swift.

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

All of the best mines for silver have already been depleted in recent years. There is a severe supply shortage developing. At the same time, demand is skyrocketing. Solar panels, electric cars, electronics and many other products need more silver than ever.

Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.

Inflation adjusted Silver should be at $1,000 instead of 25$.

Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price.

Think about the Gainz. If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you'd be destroying along the way.

Tldr- Corner the market. Gold Ventures thinks its possible to squeeze $SLV, FUCK AFTER SEEING $AG AND $GME EVEN I THINK WE CAN DO IT. BUY $SLV GO ALL IN TH GAINZ WILL BE UNLIMITED. DEMAND PHYSICAL IF YOU CAN. FUCK THE BANKS.

If the brokerages close trading on $SLV or various silver miners, we can continue to squeeze the market by purchasing physical silver at online or local silver/gold dealers. It all trickles into COMEX to squeeze supply.

&#x200B;

Update 2/4 - someone went ahead and spelled out the mechanics of the squeeze quite well and I would like to give their post attention [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc8vgo/slv\_is\_not\_going\_to\_get\_squeezedslv\_is\_the\_trojan/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc8vgo/slv_is_not_going_to_get_squeezedslv_is_the_trojan/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \- however, they are betting on SLV which is controversial. If SLV does have the silver they say they do it‚Äôs a great bet. If not, then PSLV is the way to go. I have switched to PSLV

Update 2/2 - I am able to comment again. I messaged several mods on Reddit and the mod account on Twitter. None of them responded but it appears I am able to comment again so I assume one of them lifted my ban

Update 2/1 - I have been banned from posting on WSB. I guess they aren‚Äôt yet deleting my post here given the media attention. If this was a rogue mod I‚Äôd appreciate being restored the ability to post on WSB.  I‚Äôm open to talking to any mods

Update 1/31 - there have been tons of 'what to buy' questions so [I added a clarity post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9tzkv/the_dd_on_slv_updated_131_clarity_on_what_to_buy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), hope it helps.  It's also getting downvoted to hell because its not about GME so that's discouraging.  The speed at which the downvotes flew in makes me think someone made bots to crush new posts related to SLV (or maybe anything not GME).  It makes no sense for this post to have 93% upvotes and my new one to have 28%.

I have not sold my GME to buy SLV.  I had a small pre-existing position in leaps I bought months ago.

Created an [official Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20) not sure if I‚Äôll use it, but didn‚Äôt want anyone to impersonate me on there

Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV, a follow-up from my shorter post a few hours ago. Note that I talk in first person as this is something I‚Äôm going to do. Everyone is free to do as they individually please and copy my trade if they‚Äôd like to.  I think it‚Äôs absurd that forces at be think this forum is manipulating by posting publicly but that‚Äôs where we are at right now.

First things first, **I'm not doing this until the GME rise is done.** I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after.

Update 1/29: due to the manipulation and collusion of citadel, hedge funds, and brokers to change the rules and rig the game in their favor. Who likely knew ahead of time and bought puts right before and calls at the bottom, GME is too important to abandon still. SLV is still my next play but GME needs to go to $1000 and these people need to go to jail.

**If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end**

I present 2 investment DDs in this post, the short squeeze and the fundamentals.  If you want to see what to buy

**The short squeeze:**

Buy SLV shares and SLV call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults. Also buy physical silver bullion.  The best possible thing would be to take physical delivery in the futures market if you have access to do so.

The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now.  This means that for every  250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.  Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.

The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible.  It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan.  Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).

The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver.  There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher.  There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.  With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here.  The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world.  Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it.  If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value.  They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.

Edit for more detail:  let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs one futures seller who gets unlucky and gets the buyer who actually wants to take delivery. He doesn‚Äôt have the silver and realizes it‚Äôs all of a sudden damn difficult to find some physical silver.  He throws up his hands and just goes long a matching number of futures contracts and will demand actual delivery on those. Problem solved because he has now matched the demanding buyer with a new seller.  The issue is that the new seller has the same issue and does the exact same thing.  This is how the cascade effect of a meltup occurs.  All the naked shorts trying to offload their position to someone who actually has some silver. My goal is to ensure that I have the silver and won‚Äôt sell to them until silver is at a far higher price due to the desperation.

The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available.  Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy.  They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.

**The fundamentals:**

The current gold to silver ratio is 73-1.  Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver.  Naturally occurring silver is only 18.75 times as common as gold, so this ratio of 73-1 is quite high.  Until the early 20th century, silver prices were pegged at a 15-1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then.  In terms of current production, the ratio is even lower at 8-1.  Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold.

Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years, but now their silver vaults are empty.  At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver, but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies, the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0.24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market. But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil.

This 0.24 billion ounces represents only  8% of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally.  This means that 92% of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades.  These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies.  It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house. Also, with silver at $23 an ounce currently, this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion.  For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion. This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used, as I have mentioned.  $70 billion sounds like a lot, but we don‚Äôt have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot.

\*\*If the squeeze happens, it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months \*\*

The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world.  Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust, but it is spread very thin.  Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper.  This means that even as the silver price skyrockets, it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced.  Even if new mines were to be constructed, it could take years to come online.

Finally, most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment.  It is used in electronics, solar panels, and jewelry for the most part. This demand wont go away if the silver price rises, so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver.  The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand.

The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion.  The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar, so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in, driving demand for silver.  The $1.9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst.  All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur, and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself.

&#x200B;

**What to buy:**

Edit 2/24: I now advocate buying PSLV for shares, physical metal if the premiums come back down, and if you want options then SLV is still ok for that.

I will be putting **50% directly into SLV shares, and 50% into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16**.  This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35.  Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if the short squeeze happens.

Edit: for the part of your purchases going into shares, some people recommend PSLV because they think SLV might start lying about having the silver in their vault. Or that the custodian will be double counting, ie claiming that the same silver belongs to multiple people (banking on the fact that people wont all try to get their silver at once).  So if you buy SLV shares and calls, that's great.  But I think it could be prudent for us to buy options in SLV (no options on PSLV) and shares in PSLV.  It all depends on how paranoid you want to be.  There is a lot of paranoia in the precious metals world.

Alternate options:

\- buying physical silver; this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay

\- going long futures for February or March; if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so.  But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem.  We need actual physical delivery, which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery

\- miners; I don‚Äôt recommend buying miners as part of this trade.  Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up, but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market.  Furthermore, most silver miners only derive 30-50% of their revenue from silver anyways, so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough (and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage)

**Details on SLV physical settlement:**

When SLV issues shares, the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily.  From the SLV prospectus:

""An investment in Shares is:  Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.  The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee‚Äôs arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust‚Äôs silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian‚Äôs or, if applicable, sub-custodian's, books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First here is the other post [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the\_biggest\_short\_squeeze\_in\_the\_world\_slv\_silver/?utm\_source=share\&amp;amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app\&amp;amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Second, everyone buy and hold GME through at least $1000 before buying silver because the shorts are still at 139% of the float so there is a technical reason to stay long until they really cover.

Third, the other post said to buy miners, but that won‚Äôt cause a silver squeeze. The miners will benefit from the squeeze, but buying miners alone does nothing to actually beat the manipulating banks at their own game in silver.

So here‚Äôs how you do it:

Buy SLV directly.  If you want options buy in the money or near the money to force true hedging (buying) by the market maker.  This is a very old and slower moving market than equities so unless you are buying leaps, SLV shares are the way to go anyways.  Alternatively, buy silver physically or even force delivery through purchasing futures if you are rich and can store it.  Physical silver purchases carry a premium over spot price though so you end up causing more physical silver to be purchased by simply buying SLV.

By purchasing SLV, more shares will be created and SLV will have to purchase massive amounts of physical silver to hold in their vaults because the etf has to remain backed by physical silver.

Silver is a much larger market than GME, but the paper traded gold market is 100x the physical market.  If we force more physical purchase and delivery of silver, the paper traders will be required to buy it in real life and deliver it. Creating a positive feedback loop just like a short squeeze.

Lastly, the fundamental case is that government stimulus combined with fed money and reopening economy will cause inflation, and that government debt loads mean dollar debasement. Lest someone say we are manipulating the market (as big banks have literally been doing for decades). We like the stock!

Let‚Äôs get GME to the moon and then park all of the winnings in SLV. Could take a couple of months to fully moon as delivery of silver takes time but it really could go to $1000 from $25.  If GME took down a single hedge fund, this would take down JPM.

Please share, it‚Äôs hard to break through right now

kpwsms_SLV,SLV,"Sold SLV at a loss last week, will buying SLVP tomorrow be considered a wash sale? (Substantially identical?)","The replies to my situation may be instructive to other people who are dealing with wash sales.

**Situation:**

Years ago I bought SLV at a high price and managed to Sell it at a LOSS last week. I plan to report it as capital loss on my 2020 taxes to offset other gains.

Tomorrow (within 30 days of selling SLV), I want to Buy SLVP. 

**Question:**

I want to confirm if this will be considered a wash sale (I don't want a wash sale). This determination hinges on whether this is a 'Substantially Identical Security'. IRS instructions are not clear to me (and many people), about whether these two securities are Substantially Identical.

**What the heck are SLV and SLVP?:**

SLV and SLVP are both ETFs provided by iShares that are focused on the silver precious metal. Both have similar performance. In addition, it's known that when the price of silver goes up, the stock value of the actual silver MINING companies go up too. So there's some... identicality there, I guess.

However, there are also DIFFERENCES...

SLV = iShares Silver Trust = Seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of silver. It's a precious metals ETF that holds / is physically backed by the actual metal, silver.
Link: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239855/ishares-silver-trust-fund

SLVP = iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF = Seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of global equities of companies primarily engaged in the business of silver exploration or metals mining. It's holdings are shares in a list of actual silver mining companies.

hyrlcb_SLV,SLV,TRADE OF THE DAY: Silver ETF ($SLV) $18 Cash-Secured Put 18SEP Series [07/27/20],"*Hello World!*

 ‚Äî  **Pre-Market Summary**

S&P futures rebounded from last week's dump on Monday, ending a two-day slide on Wall Street, as expectations for a more dovish outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve - due to deteriorating economic conditions - brightened the market mood ahead of the busiest week for quarterly earnings reports which sees updates from companies including Apple, Amazon and Boeing.

Strong gains are inevitable as we enter a period much like the post-GFC environment, where gold prices soared to record levels as a result of copious amounts of Fed money being pumped into the financial system.  It does not pay dividends - but it sure does move higher. [Gold takes out THE level.](https://i.imgur.com/DkJkeO1.png)

 ‚Äî  **Top Overnight News**

* Spot gold blasted past its longstanding record while silver rode on its coattails as investors seek havens outside the plunging dollar
* China reported the most number of domestic coronavirus infections since the end of the outbreak in Wuhan, raising fears of a serious resurgence
* The lowering of the American flag from the consulate in Chengdu caps a week in which U.S.-China relations spiraled to new lows
* Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said conflict between the U.S. and China could expand into a ‚Äúcapital war‚Äù that he suggested would harm the dollar

 ‚Äî  **Trade Of The Day**

With large cap tech stocks over-extended and expectations for this week's earnings reports already priced in, alpha might be found in a different place.

Precious metals are in accumulation mode once again, and the [Silver ETF (SLV) has led the pack this week, gaining 17.8%.](https://i.imgur.com/aRkO0Dw.png)

Even though the price is flagging out nicely as a consolidation, there's a chance that we'll see a pullback to fill one of these massive gaps from last week.

Here are two potential plays:

1. **Placing a limit order at $20/share as a buy point on any pullback would be our entry, with an associated stop below $18/share**. This gap of $2.00 between the entry price and the stop represents your ""risk,"" which needs to be sized to no more than 1-2% of your account value. For example, if you traded a ten share position, then your aggregate risk would be $20. This represents a 2% risk position for a $1000 account.
2. The more interesting choice is an options trade that allows you to trade against the $18 SLV level. **You would sell an SLV 18SEP $18 cash-secured put which would collect $25/contract** and allow you to profit from any further move higher in SLV without directly investing in it. You would need free capital of at least $1800/contract to accept assignment of SLV shares should the price be at or under $18/share by the 18th of September. If the price is higher than $18/share at that time, you keep the $25/contract credit and your obligation to buy the shares is released.

Silver in its bullion form is less common than gold, while estimates of above ground bullion vary there is likely between 2-3 billion ounces of silver bars and coins. The mining ratio of silver to gold is currently 9-1 while the estimated reserves in the earth crust is 17-1. Silver is rarely found in concentrated deposits like gold except in a few places, this is one of the reasons that should silver rise in value it will take some time for mining to catch up with demand. Additionally, since silver‚Äôs USD value is still the same as it was in the 80s **without** adjusting for inflation, it is difficult to keep mines profitable so many have closed.

Silver‚Äôs primary consumption comes from industrial use, until the 00s the majority demand came from photo chemistry, but now photovoltaic cells, computers, and electronics take most quantities. Since Silver is the most conductive element for both heat and electrons, there will continue to be industrial demand for silver even when prices rise.

Historically governments like the US would carry stockpiles of silver as they did gold but in the 80s and 90s the US government sold their stockpile to industry, this same sell-off has occurred for many countries. As more and more silver has been used for industry much of it has been ‚Äúconsumed‚Äù and is now dispersed in ways that are unrecoverable or in landfills. It is difficult to find out how much silver has been depleted but it is estimated that there were over 5 billion ounces of silver bullion in the 1960s above ground and we know there is much less today due to industry use. Additionally, easy to extract deposits have slowly been producing less silver per ton of rock processed, so every year there is a higher cost to mining meanwhile silver continues to have less purchasing power since the 1980s.

Stepping away from silver for a moment let's talk about the macro situation facing United States citizens. While most people do not talk about it everyone knows the United States reaps great benefit from the USD being the world reserve currency. This reserve status is written into western central bank laws that until recently could only back their fractional reserve banking system with USD and US treasuries. Now under the Basel III accords central banks will be able to fully back their reserve banking systems with gold which is bullish for precious metals.

While the USD is still the main world reserve currency, the national debt has been able to double every 10 years for nearly fifty years while the purchasing power of the dollar remains steady. This means that even though China produces much of the physical goods consumed in the world, and while the US has a trade deficit with most countries, you wouldn‚Äôt know it because the US dollar can still purchase a ton of real physical commodities. One of the big reasons the government debt can keep increasing is because dollar denominated debt across the world is increasing; as the US inflates the money supply it actually helps states within its alliances so that they can pay down their dollar denominated debts. Additionally, the US needs the dollar to weaken so that foreign nations never run into a situation where their own currency cannot purchase dollars to service their dollar debt.

This last point is really quite important, the Asian financial crisis in the 90s was caused because of a strong dollar, and once again we find the dollar strong as nations across the world are having a hard time servicing their dollar denominated debt; that is unless they have access to dollars through the feds newly created swap lines. These swap lines do two things, they get dollars in the hands of allies that need them, and they help prop up the treasury market which started to fail even before COVID: yes governments across the world stopped buying treasuries before COVID started! The US, much like Japan, can now only find purchasers for its government debt through its central bank which is a terrible situation to be in.

So today in the midst of COVID, 25-30 million people are without a job if you include PPP workers. In this environment we do not have many options, the government will have to continue to print money as will many governments around the world. This simple situation is bullish for gold price alone but when you factor in the probable collapse of the US dollar, due to the world losing confidence in our currency, then being exposed to precious metals as a US citizen is imperative to your financial safety.

Now why silver over gold? Well I first explained to you the fundamentals for physical silver and demand but what I haven‚Äôt talked about is the silver price manipulation in the trading markets. Until 2016 the two markets that controlled silver and gold spot price where the gold fix in England and the COMEX futures trading desk in New York. The London Gold fix has existed for over 100 years while the COMEX was only formed in the 1970s after Nixon closed the gold window and worked with Saudi Arabia to form the petroleum dollar.

The way the petro dollar works is this, Saudi Arabia only accepts USD for oil and then gives their USD to the bullion banks that steward the COMEX who in turn help Saudi Arabia purchase leasing rights for future precious metals production in mines across the world. Effectively the USD is still backed by gold through this agreement with Saudi Arabia which is now coming to an end. Saudi Arabia is now accepting oil purchases in the Chinese RMB, this is a bad sign for the petro dollar and a reason that the low price of gold in USD cannot continue.

You see the COMEX future trading desk has been used by the large banks, probably backed by the government, to lower the price of precious metals against the USD so that the petro dollar arrangement with Saudi Arabia can function. This is one of the reasons until six months ago that the price of oil always rose and fell exactly with the dollar. However, in 2016 China started its own spot price market in Shanghai and there is now a Shanghai gold fix. As Saudi Arabia can now buy gold with the Chinese RMB this is one of the big reasons that they are taking RMB as payment for oil. Additionally the Shanghai gold fix gives China some power to control the price of precious metals which they can weaponize should they decide to.

China, Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, have been hoarding and stockpiling gold for years but not reporting their holdings to the UN or IMF. As such it is very likely that these countries will do quite well once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. Many western countries outside the classic axis powers (Germany and Italy), France, and Switzerland do not have large gold reserves. In fact Britain sold off half their reserves when Gordon Brown was their PM which will probably go down as the stupidest move in a long history of bad moves, yes the country that started the original gold fix does not own that much of the precious metal. The rest of the English speaking world, except for America, does not have much gold either; Ireland, Canada, and Australia barely have any reserves.

So do you expect the gold price to rise and are you planning to purchase some exposure? If you say yes then I would have you pay attention to the fact that gold is worth six-seven times what it was in 2001 but silver is still the same USD value that is was in the 80s. Additionally, the amount of money invested in the silver bullion market is a fraction of the gold market, this is at the same time that the bullion banks have short silver positions larger than that of their short positions in gold. Men like Ted Butler have done a good job documenting the shorting of silver over the past 20-30 years, suffice to say it is a fact that the CFTC does not enforce their own rules upon the bullion banks. JPMorgan has had traders of their precious metals desk convicted of felonies in recent years for market manipulation while JPMorgan as also amassed one of the largest silver stock piles in the world.

If you look at both instances of silver‚Äôs historical breakouts in 1980 and 2011, you will see that 20.50 USD is an important resistance point. Once silver crosses this threshold it should move very fast. While you can, you should split your precious metal investments between 50 percent physical silver and call options on the SLV ETF, my recommendation on call options is to buy the highest out the money options for Jan 2021 but roll those options out to a later date if silver has not started moving past 20.50 USD by October or early November. If you are interested in learning more about the large silver price manipulation on the COMEX futures market take a look at the documentation online by Ted Butler, Ed Steer, and Bert Chilton.

-investors selling their gold to buy equity in markets

As we can see gold is ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù

SILVER OR $SLV trust dipped harshly from 20$ and ounce to 11$ this is unheard of in the business and time and time again when silver gets this low this quick it recovers FAST.

Do yourself a favor and long silver while it‚Äôs cheap. 
14$ calls for end of May. You‚Äôll hit it I promise.

Extra info- when silver reaches prices this low, mining company have to stop producing since it costs more to produce than its worth, in turn bullion companies are forced to buy from the public which increases demand and increases the price per ounce.

I am lately thinking about buying SLV US and/or GLD US, because of currently uncertain markets and all the bad forcasting... but they don't really seem to be doing anything else than falling even in the last few weeks with all the volatility. I am more bias bear market for the next few months, but I am not so sure that commodities are as safe buy&hold as they used to be. Should I reconsider instead buying some ETF focusing on shorting? If so, any suggestions? I am only monitoring RUSS US.

Any opinion is welcome, thank you in advance :)",2015-09-29,2,3

2i4k9x_SLV,SLV,Eli5: Difference between ETF and ETN (slv vs slvo),"So in looking to invest in Silver, I have been doing some research. I am not asking about the merits of silver, but I'm asking about the difference specifically in the 2 funds I found: SLV (iShares silver ETF) and SLVO (Credit Suisse Covered Call ETN). 

Now they both track exactly the same, but SLVO is providing a dividend. I've read about 4 descriptions of what ETNs are and i get that they are unsecured Debt but i'm just kinda whirling as to the real difference and I need it broken drown and it seems like SLVO might be a better option since it provides a dividend but how the hell is it doing that?  Don't call me stupid, I am stupid, but try to explain why i'm stupid. Thanks!",2014-10-02,1,4

2gwizd_GLD,GLD,Possibly time to start investing in $PPLT $GLD and $SLV,"The market is healthy booming and bustling and seemingly ever growing, there is some worry that 2015 could be a rough year, however and judging by how active and booming things have been in regard to the stock market and how low the value of Platinum, Gold, and Silver is at the moment, perhaps it is time to start looking at making that 5 year transition from stocks into ore investment.

Right now Platinum (PPLT) is trading at around $130 a share, one of its lowest values in the last decade. At its peak as recently as 2011 when the market was lower, it traded for $185. Assuming you invested heavily in Platinum now which appears to be at its floor, you could stand to make solid profits on it 5 years or so down the line, possibly within even the next two years if the wave comes crashing down in 2015.

Gold is a much less certain investment at the moment, it has remained around a healthy $117 per share with its 2011 peaks putting it around $150. There is still a lot of room for growth down the line in the investment but GLD has traded as low as $80 a share as recently as 2008, so perhaps it has more room to fall before you buy in. A good play would be to look into Barrick Gold $ABX which is currently trading around 20 year lows under $16 but multiple times in those two decades has passed $31 a share, even topping out near $54 in 2008 and $56 in 2011.

Lastly the most volatile of the bunch, Silver (SLV) [ and by extension $USV and $SIL ] is supposedly more risky but I think even if you have to wait a little longer for it to boom, you stand to make huge profits should the economy bounce. Historically at its lowest points, Silver can trade from anywhere between $12 (extremely low) and $16 dollars, it is now nearing that floor at just under $18 a share. If you buy in now you may be looking at initial losses for a year or so, so patience and monitoring how it acts could be key. SLV is somewhat less predictable than its higher priced and more highly traded counterparts, but as recent as 2011 when the market was low, it traded around an impressive $47 per share, even getting $40 out of a $16-$18 investment would be huge, and a far larger gain than from either $PPLT or $GLD but it may take longer for itself to manifest.

*$SIL is currently trading at all-decade lows around $11 - $12 a share, within the decade coinciding with the weak stock market from 2011 through the first half of 2012, it traded as high as $28 in 2011 while also having two $25 dollar high peaks in 2012 after a dip midway through that year.*",2014-09-19,5,4
