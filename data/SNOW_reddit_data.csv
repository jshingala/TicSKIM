Winnipeg, Manitoba--(Newsfile Corp. - May 28, 2025) - Snow Lake Resources Ltd., d/b/a Snow Lake Energy (NASDAQ: LITM) (""**Snow Lake**""), a uranium exploration and development company, and *Exodys Energy*, a premier U.S. nuclear engineering services provider specializing in nuclear fuel recycling solutions, are pleased to announce their collaboration in supporting the formation of a new, purpose-driven nuclear reactor development and deployment company (the ""**Reactor Company**""). This strategic alliance marks a significant step forward in enabling the delivery of clean, reliable energy solutions designed to meet the rapidly growing needs of AI-powered infrastructure and hyperscale data centers. Since announcing their Memorandum of Understanding (the ""**MOU**"") in February, 2025, the partners played a central role in shaping the Reactor Company's commercialization roadmap and integrated risk mitigation strategy.

**A Significant Step in Snow Lake's Nuclear Diversification Strategy**

This development represents a pivotal advancement in Snow Lake's ongoing **diversification into the nuclear industry**. Following its successful acquisitions of key uranium exploration projects in Wyoming, and a strategic investment in Global Uranium and Enrichment Limited (""**GUE**"") (which included uranium enrichment technologies), Snow Lake is now expanding its nuclear footprint to include reactor design, development, and deployment. The leadership of the new Reactor Company will be unveiled over the coming weeks.

*""Our recent uranium acquisitions and equity stake in GUE demonstrate Snow Lake's commitment to becoming a full-spectrum player in the nuclear energy sector,""* said **Frank Wheatley**, CEO of Snow Lake Energy. *""The incubation of this dedicated Reactor Company positions Snow Lake as one of the few vertically integrated companies in the nuclear industry - from uranium supply through to enrichment and to reactor development and deployment. This is a natural and strategic progression in our mission to power the AI-driven future with clean, reliable energy.""*

**Momentum Driven by Policy and Innovation**

This announcement comes at a time of unprecedented momentum for nuclear energy, driven by the four nuclear Executive Orders signed by President Trump^(\[1\]) on May 23, 2025**,** that will streamline regulatory processes, accelerate reactor licensing, and cement domestic nuclear fuel security. These directives provide a favorable backdrop for Snow Lake's new Reactor Company and broader nuclear sector strategy.

*""The ongoing U.S. nuclear resurgence, bolstered by President Trump's Executive Orders, creates an extraordinary and timely opportunity for Snow Lake to lead the next wave of innovation with the Reactor Company's founding team, and supported by partners like Exodys,""* said **Carl Perez**, CEO of Exodys Energy. *""Supporting Snow Lake in its technical and commercial roadmap is not merely a plan - it is a response to the urgent need to domestically scale and deploy nuclear power reactors. Together, we are committed to building a resilient and circular nuclear ecosystem to power the future.""*

**Snow Lake's First Principles Approach**

Since the initial announcement of the partnership and execution of the MOU in February 2025, both companies and the scouted founding team have thoroughly discussed reactor development risks and deployment considerations to determine the path of least resistance with the highest financial return. As a result, the new Reactor Company is opting for a pragmatic approach to advanced nuclear development by focusing on a **small modular reactor (SMR)** design based on existing and mature pressurized water reactor (**PWR**) technology. This enables it to leverage the deep expertise and industrial infrastructure associated with PWR reactors - ensuring strong regulatory readiness, a mature supply chain, time-tested technology, and established operator training pipelines. Snow Lake is therefore centered on driving the **most rapid and reliable path to generating nuclear power**. In partnering with Exodys Energy, Snow Lake is anticipating the challenges that advanced reactors will face in regards to spent nuclear fuel storage and management costs-further amplifying its unique foresighted and comprehensive approach.

* **Exodys Energy will provide technical guidance**, as it relates to fuel cycle considerations and targeted reactor engineering support
* **Snow Lake will drive commercial execution**, integrating its uranium assets, strategic equity positions in GUE, and strong market presence to advance the new Reactor Company's goals
* **Key leadership roles in the new Reactor Company** will be filled by seasoned technology leaders with decades of engineering experience across both current and advanced reactor technologies. Full details will be announced in the coming weeks

*""This is just the beginning,""* added **Frank Wheatley**. *""As we deepen our nuclear partnerships, we have grown increasingly acclimated to the success factors driving this industry. Our approach is simple and focused: energy must be delivered. To meet this challenge, we are building on a proven playbook of development and deployment, alongside a proven executive team, to kickstart our path to generating nuclear energy. In addition, the collaboration with Exodys Energy ensures the anticipation of spent fuel management challenges and its revenue potential. Snow Lake's vertical integration strategy positions us to earn revenue throughout the value chain and reactor asset life - before, during, and after reactor operations.""*

1gv77n8_MSFT,MSFT,Let it $SNOW,"Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.

But this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:

1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.
2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).
3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.
4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)
5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.
6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market. 

**Q**: Ok, but why is THIS time different than all the other earnings reports when $SNOW crashed and burned?

**A**: Like I said in Point 2 above, we Snowflakians always beat revenue and EPS predictions, but for some reason the stock always goes down. The reason behind this - as is the consensus of analysts - is that investors are cautious against how much money $SNOW is pouring into their products, R&D, and operating costs. This quarter we should start to actually see the results of these investments, returning strong usage statistics and a healthy increase in overall adoption from the industry.

1gv77n8_SNOW,SNOW,Let it $SNOW,"Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.

But this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:

1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.
2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).
3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.
4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)
5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.
6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market.

1gi7s8w_SNOW,SNOW,SnowFlake’s Stock Buyback and Short-Term Optimism,"Snowflake recently issued two billion dollars in zero-percent-interest convertible senior notes due in 2027 and 2029, which reflects a high level of confidence from both management and investors about the company’s short-term growth potential. Here’s a breakdown of what this move means and why Snowflake might be taking this route:

The cash from this debt issuance will partially fund a stock buyback program, reducing the number of shares on the market, which often has the effect of lifting stock price by making shares scarcer. By buying back shares, Snowflake is aiming to support the stock price in the short term, potentially improving per-share earnings and appealing to investors.

So, why take on this debt if it’s going toward share buybacks? Snowflake’s move suggests they’re anticipating significant growth in the near future, likely from strong revenue and demand for their data cloud services. With the convertible notes carrying no interest payments, Snowflake doesn’t need to worry about traditional debt servicing costs. Investors instead receive an option to convert these notes into Snowflake stock, but only if the share price climbs to a level that makes the conversion profitable.

A key detail here is that these notes have a 40% conversion premium, meaning investors would only convert their notes to stock if Snowflake’s price rises significantly above current levels. If this happens, the notes convert into shares, giving Snowflake a financial cushion now without immediate dilution for existing shareholders. They also implemented a capped call transaction to reduce the risk of dilution even if the stock does convert later on.

Essentially, this move aligns with a high-confidence outlook from Snowflake’s management. They seem to believe they’ll perform well enough in the short term to drive up their stock price and make this financing favorable for the company. This strategy could provide Snowflake with more flexibility for acquisitions, product investment, and even future stock or debt issuances at more favorable terms if their market valuation continues to rise.

While it’s a bold move, it’s not without risk. If Snowflake’s growth doesn’t match expectations, they’ll have taken on significant debt without the offsetting benefit of a higher stock price. But the confidence expressed in their growth trajectory—particularly in a competitive data market—is telling, and if they can execute their strategy effectively, this could be a smart way to support their stock while preparing for further expansion.",2024-11-02,25,22
1fot1gn_SNOW,SNOW,The insanity that is $SNOW's capital allocation,"Snowflake has recently announced raising $2 bn of convertible debt to buy back $ 575m of stock with the rest for general corporate purposes. Sure, why not.

Except $SNOW has already repurchased more than $1.4 bn at higher prices. In addition, they have $3 bn in cash with (previously) $0 debt.

In the 6 months ending in 2024, they've already repurchased 5,939k shares at an average cost @ 154.30, for a total of $916 million.  In the past 18 months alone they've spent $1.4 bn on share repurchases alone at higher share prices. Shares are down 40% YTD so maybe not the best move. They've now tarnished their balance sheet just to buy back overpriced shares.

What's worse is their shares are pretty overvalued, trading at 37x forward FCF. In addition, their growth metrics are weakening, with revenue growth rates, gross margins, operating margins, and FCF margins dropping across the board. What in the world is management doing?",2024-09-25,334,131

Couple years ago I bought 20 shares of SNOW and 15 shares RIVN during their IPOs. I sold about 10 shares of SNOW when it was fairly high. (\~300) If I sold the rest of my shares, I will probably have a net gain about 0. Should I continue to hold to see if it will bounce back up or just sell it to invest in other investment vehicles? As for RIVN it is just a complete (excuse my frech) shit show. I bought it during the peak and the stock price never went up from there. In times like these, should I just sell all my shares to reap my loss?  Thanks in advance!",2024-08-25,38,55

1dhbl0z_SNOW,SNOW,"$SNOW - poor margins, decelerating growth - bottom not in, yet","I have been hearing fair bit of negative news about Snowflake ($SNOW) lately. Based on an [article ](https://csec.substack.com/p/snowflakes-icy-uphill-battle-cloud?r=3xqwa9)I came across, there are a few key points that have me worried:

1. The company's fundamentals are being called into question, with some analysts valuing it at half or less of its current market price due to slowing growth, low profit margins, and a lack of clear strategy.
2. Several customers are reportedly looking to cut their contracts by 20-30%, either by reducing usage or negotiating additional discounts to avoid the ""Snowflake tax.""
3. There's speculation that the board is pushing for the return of former CEO Frank Slootman, who may be the only ally current CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy has on the board.
4. Concerns have been raised about whether Ramaswmy is the right fit for the leadership role, with suggestions that he requires guidance rather than providing it himself.

Personally, I agree with these key points, although I don't believe Slootman will actually come back. This likely means the stock will drop to $90 by August and potentially even lower by the end of the year.

While I'm sure some ""bottom-feeders"" will be tempted to scoop up shares due to the 60% decline, I would strongly caution against that. In my opinion, this stock is heading lower, and I've already taken a short position which I plan to add to if it bounces back up.

Sell $SNOW before it melts.

PS - for those who are saying it will go up because it's gone down a lot or because they have amazing product, I highly recommend reading. The main point here is - they are losing on price and that's terrible for a ""growth"" company.",2024-06-16,21,36

I'm also learning how to do technical analysis, and when I really take my time I seem to be forecasting fairly accurately. I wanted to see some thoughts on SNOW right now. It suffered a rapid decline in late May due to a data breach, falling nearly 21% in price. On Thursday, they announced the investigation into the hacking incident had been closed, affecting 125 business clients and was limited to users not utilizing 2-factor authentication. With the investigation over and breach resolved, do you think the price will rebound next week? ",2024-06-15,12,36

**New Leadership: Sridhar Ramaswamy**

Snowflake’s new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, brings a highly technical background and a strong focus on AI:

* **Education:** PhD in Computer Science from Brown University
* **Career Highlights:** Played a crucial role in growing Google’s advertising business from $1.5 billion to over $100 billion in annual revenue during his 15-year tenure
* **Entrepreneurial Venture:** Co-founded Neeva, an AI-powered, ad-free search engine
* **Snowflake Integration:** Neeva was acquired by Snowflake in 2023, leading to Ramaswamy’s appointment as the Senior Vice President of AI
* Additional background [HERE](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Can-you-provide-hlYYMtLOS6.hVNE_ZQsv_w)

Although Frank Slootman’s shoes will be tough to fill, Ramaswamy’s technical expertise in AI makes him a promising fit for the role.

**Strategic Timing for AI Expansion**

In recent quarters, Snowflake has faced criticism for lagging in AI capabilities and losing market share. However, its healthy financial position and reports of a record number of AI startups going on sale ([LINK](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-13/more-ai-founders-looking-to-sell-startups-hugging-face-ceo-says?embedded-checkout=true)) present a unique opportunity. **This could be a prime time for Snowflake to jumpstart its AI ambitions at a discount, leveraging Ramaswamy’s expertise.**

1bqwmik_SNOW,SNOW,Snowflake selloff seems like a temporary accident,"Daily queries growth of 63% and 131% Net Revenue Retention at the low end of the (non AI) cycle show just how much they sandbagged guidance of 22%. Both lead to future revenue growth. For comparison, they just achieved 36% annual revenue growth with daily queries growth of 73% and 158% NRR as the cycle was trending down. Now the cycle is about to trend up. I'd be surprised if revenue growth is lower than 27% this year.

The new CEO Sridhar Ramasway is better than Slootman in every way. Slootman was a has-been-MBA-suit cashing in on his cachet like John Chen at BlackBerry. Took extreme stock based comp for himself and kept selling shares nonstop, while not keeping up with industry competition. Tech expertise is essential for tech CEOs to lead their companies to a monopolistic outcome. Research on the economics of tires (Slootman), not so much.

The company is about to become relevant in the AI space due to this change in leadership. And web services companies are probably the biggest long term beneficiaries of AI. They have better economics (network, scale, incremental capital requirements). The new CEO expects several new product launches this year and he delivered one [yesterday](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/unlock-insights-with-snowflake-data-clean-rooms/). That's impressive after a little over one month on the job.

By now everyone knows the CEO bought $5m worth of shares as part of his compensation contract this week. However, what's actually more interesting is Mark D. McLaughlin bought $501k worth of stock above $165 this month without being required to do so as part of any agreement. He similarly added $300k early last year at a higher price. He's a director of Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks, and Chairman of Qualcomm. Definitely the kind of guy who has his finger on the pulse of the tech scene. So if he's buying more this year than last year at the same price, he is more confident in the company's future now.

The Snowflake selloff seems like it is a temporary accident because the company is widely analyzed.

Edit: For all the programmers who argue that Snowflake is overpriced vs Redshift, Synapse, etc. and how it is far behind Databricks, please read:

My guess is that part of the decline in Net Revenue Retention and Revenue growth rates are partially due to this factor - people optimizing their use of the product for its true intent. The optimized processes still run on Snowflake after all. And there is more data and activity on Snowflake now. Most revenue is optimized, so the impact of that optimization wave on NRR diminishes. NRR rises again and converts $5.2 billion Remaining Purchase Obligations to revenue faster.
4. Redshift is a dumpster fire according to many sources. [Like this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/12mw1yy/redshift_vs_snowflake//)

SNOW took a nosedive after beating earnings, and I'm beginning to think this might be a contrarian buying opportunity.

**The Dip – Why Did It Happen?**

* Weaker-than-expected revenue guidance
* Surprise announcement of CEO Frank Slootman's retirement
* Broader correction in richly valued tech stocks

**The Bullish Case for SNOW**

* **Customer Base:** SNOW continues to expand its roster of Fortune 500 clients like MasterCard, Captial One, AT&T, Pfizer, and more.
* **Net Revenue Retention Rate (NRR) Excellence:** Snowflake's NRR exceeding 160% showcases exceptional customer loyalty and their ability to expand spending within their existing user base.
* **Robust Forward Demand:** Product remaining income (RPO) growth in excess of 100% signals a strong pipeline of committed future revenue, bolstering confidence in sustained growth.
* **Profitability Within Reach:** Steadily improving operating margins point to a clear path towards profitability – a key milestone for long-term investors.
* **Cloud Data Warehousing Dominance:** Snowflake isn't just a player in the expanding cloud data warehousing market; it's a driving force shaping the industry's competitive landscape.

**Incoming CEO: Sridhar Ramaswamy**

* **Google Veteran:** Ramaswamy's extensive experience leading Google's advertising business underscores his expertise in large-scale data management and monetization.
* **AI Focus:** His background could signal a push for integrating advanced AI and machine learning capabilities into Snowflake's platform.

**Technical Analysis**

SNOW recently found support near its 50-day moving average, a potentially bullish sign.

Oversold RSI (Relative Strength Index) suggests momentum may be shifting in favor of the bulls.

**My Strategy – Calls**

**3/8 $207.5 & 3/15 $202.5**

It's riskier, but if they bounce back from this dip, the upside will be significant.

**Your thoughts?**

* Is SNOW's sell-off an overreaction, or are there deeper headwinds?
* How does the CEO change factor into your long-term thesis?
* Any chart patterns or indicators that support (or counter) the bullish case?

**TLDR:** SNOW's post-earnings drop looks like an overreaction. Customer growth, strong metrics, and incoming Google exec hint at upside. I'm playing the rebound with call options but managing risk. Your thoughts?

Today is the day I'm gonna risk it all. I either become a legend or a martyr tonight. Failure is no longer an option; the ball has hit the ground, and the only choice is to bounce back or die trying. Today we have on the menu: Snowflake, Paramount, and C3 dot ai ( dot = . (reddit makes it a link lmao))

1. **SNOW** \- If there's one thing I have learned this earnings season, it’s that cloud stocks get slaughtered, whether they beat or miss earnings. Only a handful of cloud companies go up, and I am sure Snowflake isn’t one of them. It’s still a long way to go for Snowflake to become profitable. Take a look at their leadership; I can’t see a single face that doesn’t look younger than 50. This company is way overvalued as well, 77B market cap with a PE of -100??? Tonight I'm just following the trend of other cloud providers, and they all shit the bed after earnings, so I am shorting this company. Also, add to all this that Cramer is bullish on them…….
2. **PARA** \- Paramount makes some damn good movies: Godfather, Interstellar, Top gun, TWOWS, SPR, Shutter Island, KOTFM, and many more. I went to the cinema a couple of months ago to watch the new Mission Impossible in 4DX, and I had a blast. Warren Buffett sold his PARA holdings last quarter; we all know this boomer has lost his Midas touch by now, so I am very confident coming into earnings tonight. Tbh this play comes more from the heart than from the brain.
3. **AI** \- Honestly, this ticker says enough. Expect green dildos tonight

Let me learn you in on my friend *Snowflake*. **$SNOW** has stayed one of my favorite names to trade the past 6 months. Contracts move very favorably when you enter correctly, and this stock loves to pump (loves to dump on some days), AKA you get a good entry and you WILL print. Why enter now?

**$SNOW** reports earnings on 2/28 Wednesday. Normally, I don't care about playing earnings. HOWEVER, we see how $NVDA just blew their's out of the water, and it moved the market with it. With NQ closing over 18000 today (2/22), I believe that the market is back & ready to keep going up from this resistance turned support. ***$SNOW*** *is a cloud-computing based company that also dabbles in AI* \- the massive current tech trend.

Not only are we seeming to be pushing out of four months of a consolidation range, we are now creating higher highs & lower lows. Along with those two morsels, we also have a nice looking bull flag. Neato.

Today, we also had an incredible bounce off $220 support - see here on the daily chart -

Today's candle shows that buyers are stepping back in at these levels, as the market gained back a sense of confidence. You can also get an idea by looking at the volume bars on the lower pane. We notice decreasing volume as the stock fell the past two weeks, now it has reclaimed and gotten back over the $200 key level & volume appears to be starting to increase. In the past week, there has also been 5 price upgrades from financial institutions.

As far as my own price targets are concerned, the immediate level to watch is *$237-240*. Over that, we want to target *$265-275*, *then its STRAIGHT to $300*. These are very broad areas of price to monitor, of course there will be far more exact levels to watch intraday. However, in an ideal world, we will shoot straight to $300+ when **$SNOW** crushes their ER next week.

168md1r_SNOW,SNOW,Have you ever done any fun or irrational things to try to start a snow ball?,"Have you ever considered doing anything fun / not making logical sense to try to start snowballing investments. 

Example : buying a monthly paying dividend ticker and whatever the monthly pay out is, try buying that exact amount on a daily or weekly basis to start accelerating the gains. 

Nothing crazy or stupid, but possibly not using capital in the best way because you have some of putting your money to use because it makes you feel mentally better. 

An example of how to feel better mentally while not doing it in the most efficient way would be paying off debt via the waterfall method as opposed to paying the highest interest rate. The waterfall is where you pay off the lowest dollar amount in debt and then the capital you were going to use to pay the earlier debt is snowballed into the next lowest. 

Mentally you feel better about freeing up the cash. Many people that do this method are pretty successful about getting out of debt because they feel as though they are actually making progress instead of the person that still has to write checks to 5 different companies despite being slightly ahead from a total standpoint. 

Something that I considered to be fun would be buying a weekly payout investment. I thought it could be a fun way to build up a snowball and feel constant growth. 
But with the payout being lower than the risk free investment and high expense ratios. I just couldn’t let myself actually buy it. I still had the feeling of “ eh what the hell, I’ll throw in a few dollars.” But I looked up how much money you would need in it to earn $500 a week. And that point I just got rid of any interest I had in the stocks. Still a part of of me just loves the idea. 

Not trying to give any serious financial advice, but I would love to hear about some fun ways people here try to build up a snowball",2023-09-03,5,29
16177p2_SNOW,SNOW,"NVDA is the shovel, SNOW(Snowflake) is the pick. My #1 pick.","I think the AI boom will come in two phases. 

Phase I - create the chips and the software/models for AI. NVDA can check that box

Phase II - mine, sift, store and analyze all the data. SNOW can check this box

&#x200B;

Data analysis is absolutely vital for the success of AI. AI heavily relies on high quality, well-organized/managed data for training the models. Snowflake's capabilities make it a necessity in accelerating AI development and deployment across all the industries it serves.(Financial Services, Healthcare, Retail, Entertainment, Tech, Government, Education)

&#x200B;

Training the AI Models: AI algorithms especially machine learning and deep learning models, learn patterns and connections from data. Snowflake's specializes in cloud data storage and analysis. The quality and quantity of the training data directly influences the performance of these models. Data analysis helps in understanding the characteristics of the data, identifying outliers, and preprocessing data to ensure that the AI model receives clean, relevant, and diverse inputs for effective learning. Effective data analysis helps in identifying the most informative features or variables that contribute to the AI model's performance. By analyzing data, we can determine which features are most relevant and impactful, leading to more efficient and accurate responses. Analysis helps in identifying potential biases and fairness issues, allowing developers to take corrective measures before these biases become ingrained in the AI's decision-making process. .Making SNOW a absolute necessity. 

Customization and Personalization: Data analysis enables AI systems to tailor their responses and recommendations to individual users or specific contexts. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, Organizations and individuals rely on AI to make important decisions.  Understanding these aspects instills confidence in the AI's recommendations and outputs. 

&#x200B;

In essence, the data analysis SNOW offers will become the foundation upon which successful AI systems are built. Companies like Oracle, AWS, AZURE are too big and are alot more complicated compared to what SNOW has to offer.  

Also once everyone has all the chips they need, how likely are they to keep buying more? Data management/analysis is a recurring income and growth business that now has ALOT more growth potential. 

Buffett has a billion dollar position in SNOW. 

Im expecting it to reach $250 by year end. They just beat earnings expectations this week, quarterly report had an earnings surprise of 144.44%. I believe they will grow double or triple digits for many years.

1313zp8_SNOW,SNOW,Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is Trading 140ish Now But the Fad Stock of 2020 is Still Being Chased by Retail Investors. You Cannot Outrun a Falling Star," Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) became a fad stock when it more than doubled its IPO offer price of $120 and closed at $245 in September 2020. Then, in mid-November 2021, SNOW rose to $390 -- that was an increase of 225% from the IPO offer price and made many investors giddy. One such investor was Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), which bought SNOW at the offer price and still holds $900 million worth of SNOW shares: as many realize, however, this is a tiny, tiny stake for BH and amounts to just 0.3% of the portfolio. It is believed that one of Buffett’s lieutenants, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, may be behind the selection and not Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger. The stock now trades 140ish, down 44% from the IPO closing price; those who bought in Nov. 2021 at $402 are down 65%. Only those who got in at the IPO offer price of $120, like BRK, are still in the money. Still, the company has a market cap of $44 billion and is considered among leaders in the crowded, cloud-based software space.

***Share-based Compensation is Out of Control***

SNOW commands very high valuation metrics. The company is not EBITDA-positive yet but expects to be for the fiscal year ending (FYE) January 31, 2025 (FY2). Now, it's trading at 184x FY2 EBITDA. It has been free cash flow (FCF)-positive the last 2 years but that is after adding back stock-based compensation (SBC), which amounted to $605mm in 2021and $862mm in 2022.

Without the add-back, FCF is negative. FCF is usually calculated from net income by adding back SBC just like you're adding back non-cash charges like depreciation and amortization. That's how you erase the impact of SBC from FCF, which is the equity level (i.e., levered) FCF, unlike enterprise-level earnings measures like EBITDA and EBIT that are calculated on an unadjusted basis. However, even though SBC has no impact on actual cash flow, it will bite your share price when these shares vest and dilution hits.

SNOW is just out of control with its SBC, doling out insane amounts of shares to management and employees. In 2022, the total SBC accounted for nearly half (47.4%) of net sales and 29.1% of its total costs (that is, cost of sales plus operating expenses). By contrast, among SNOW’s peers, the typical SBC accounts for 22-26% of net sales and 20-22% of total costs. Snowflake is certainly an outlier in this regard.

What jumps out from this table is the disparity in “% of Net Sales” (47.4%) vs. “% of Total Costs” (29.1%). This figure for SNOW is striking at 47.4% vs. 29.1%: the 18.3% disparity contrasts with the comparable companies that are much closer together. What this shows is the magnitude of the loss that SNOW is reporting and the resultant lack of cost discipline in awarding such large amounts of SBC to employees. SNOW is one of the largest cloud-based companies when measured in terms of equity market cap ($45 billion) and total revenues ($2.1 billion). Yet it is doling out nearly half of its total revenues to SBC for employees. SNOW’s cost structure still resembles an early-stage company funded via venture capital reporting very little revenues and burning through cash reserves in an out of control manner.

The company expects a small base of EBITDA in 2024 (FY2); therefore, any earnings metrics below EBITDA will be negative. Currently, SNOW trades at 22x its $2.1b in LTM net sales and 16x its expected FY1 net sales of $2.9b. These are among the highest revenue multiples even for a cloud-based software company. However, revenue growth is estimated at 35-40% year over year in FY1 (2023) and FY2 (2024).

Looking at the financials, SNOW has some impressive growth metrics: the aforementioned sales growth rate is impressive and it enjoys working capital benefits from having customers prepay for services with its software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model. There is very little capex and just a small amount of capitalized software; thus, depreciation and amortization are not material cash flow items.

***The Problem with SNOW’s Gross Margin and Scalability***

The issue, once again, is cost control, particularly SBC and the resulting dilution risk, and the growing concern about profitability and margins. While cloud-based software companies often enjoy 75%+ gross margins, SNOW is at 65%. To understand this, you need to look at the components of SNOW’s gross margin: aside from product sales which has a standalone gross margin of 65-72%, SNOW has a money-losing segment called “professional services and other” with a negative gross margin. Both margins are on an improving trend; however, when total revenues more than doubled as it did in FYE 2022, the gross margin for professional services worsened and only lessened losses a bit in the most recent fiscal year to -34%.

This is a labor-intensive business which helps customers migrate from legacy applications to SNOW’s platform. SNOW considers this type of customer care to be essential for customer retention. Indeed, even though this segment contributes to only 6.1-6.5% of net sales, it accounts for the majority of the revenue-generating employees at SNOW. These employees account for 55-59% of total such employees and the headcount for this business is 30% higher than those in the product segment.

The problem is that this particular segment does not seem to be very scalable: from 2021 to 2023, it has remained fairly stable at 6.1-6.5% of total revenues. In other words, while total net sales increased 249% from $554 million to $1.9 billion, the professional services segment still accounted for 6.1% of total revenues. Scalability seems to be somewhat limited for SNOW’s revenue-generating business model. While the overall gross margin could rise over time, it is questionable if it would ever rise to the level of its peers at 75%. Indeed, SNOW identifies the cost of this professional services segment as a significant risk factor in its 10-K:

*“If we are unable to successfully manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results … including our profit margins, will be harmed.”*

If the gross margin cannot go over 70% near-term, it could hinder SNOW from attaining sufficient profitability to grow its FCF meaningfully. In other words, SNOW’s growth strategy and the customer migration business model will hit the wall sooner or later without a meaningful increase in profitability.

***So How Much is SNOW Worth?***

Based on analyst projections and applying reasonable margins, SNOW could do about $700mm in unlevered FCF (sans SBC add back) in 2024. From this FCF base, we can estimate SNOW's FCF growing by 40% annually for the next 5 years using its discount rate of \~12-13%. The result is $80 in fair value for the stock; that's 43% below the 140ish stock price of recent days. This may seem harsh since the stock never traded that low in history (the lowest intraday recorded was $110.26 on June 14, 2022).

Well, those concerns were outlined above. If you consider other cloud-based software companies, the best positioned is Crowdstrike (CRWD), which has similar market cap, financials, growth rates and even stock price as SNOW: CRWD trades 130ish. I find its fair value to be \~$100, a discount of only \~20% from where it trades. CRWD has much better margins, has been growing quicker and is not hampered by SNOW’s the out-of-control and unwieldy cost structure: its gross margin averaged 74% the last 3 years and with the operating leverage accruing to its operating income and bottom line, the company seems to be ready to harvest meaningful inflow of FCF. Indeed, with a more disciplined cost structure, CRWD has been FCF-positive (without the SBC add back) since 2020. Financially, this is simply a much better-managed company than the fad stock of 2020 basking in its afterglow.

* **ADP's monthly payroll report showed private-sector jobs growing more slowly than expected.**
* **The ISM services report indicated a deceleration in service-sector growth.**
* **With high valuations and little profits, the software sector is particularly vulnerable to a recession.**

Shares of cloud software companies, including Appian (APPN -6.28%), Snowflake (SNOW -5.76%), and Shopify (SHOP -5.04%), were all moving lower today as downbeat economic data raised fears of a recession and sparked a sell-off in high-growth, tech stocks. The ADP monthly payrolls showed that just 145,000 private-sector jobs were added in March, lower than estimates of 210,000 and down from 261,000 in February. The ISM Services report also showed decelerating business activity, as the index declined from 55.1 in February to 51.2 in March. Both news items follow a downbeat report on job openings yesterday, painting a picture that the labor market is finally cracking after a year of aggressive interest-rate hikes by the Fed. The increased concerns about a recession hit the tech sector particularly hard, as much of the sector has already seen slowing growth amid other headwinds. At the end of today's session, Appian stock was down 6.3%, Snowflake had lost 5.8%, and Shopify finished the session down 5%. 

## So what   

All three of these software stocks either trade at high valuations, are unprofitable, or are barely profitable, making them particularly vulnerable to a recession. Appian, which provides a low-code software platform to enterprise-level customers, said it expected growth to slow this year, due to demand headwinds. 

After growing cloud subscription revenue by 32% in 2022, the company said growth in that category would slow to 24%-25% in 2023. It sees full-year revenue growth of just 13%-14%, compared to 27% growth in 2022.

Appian is focused on narrowing its losses, and CEO Matt Calkins has said the company is prepared for a recession. But the stock is still vulnerable to a downturn. 

Snowflake, which is known as a cloud infrastructure company that provides data warehousing services, is one of the fastest-growing and highest-valued stocks in the software sector. Product revenue jumped 54% in its fourth quarter, and the company expects it to slow to 40% in 2023.

While that's still a strong growth rate and Snowflake stock has fallen considerably from its peak, it still trades at a lofty price-to-sales ratio of 33. Since its business is consumption-based, it's likely to feel a direct impact from a slowdown in the economy.

Finally, Shopify is the leader in e-commerce software, and e-commerce is largely based on discretionary retail spending, which also makes it sensitive to a recession. While it's possible that a recession could encourage more entrepreneurs to start online retail businesses, it's likely to dampen spending on the platform, which is a key revenue driver for the company.

Shares of Snowflake Inc. fell more than 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the data-software company beat expectations with its latest quarterly results but forecast lower revenue for the full year than analysts had been anticipating.

The company generated a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss of $207 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a loss of $132 million, or 43 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. On an adjusted basis, Snowflake [**SNOW,** **+0.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/SNOW?mod=MW_story_quote) earned 14 cents a share, up from 10 cents a share a year before, whereas the FactSet consensus was for 4 cents a share.

Snowflake posted $589 million in revenue, up from $384 million a year before, while analysts were expecting $576 million. Product revenue rose to $555 million from $360 million and ahead of the FactSet consensus, which was for $542 million.

The company had a 158% net revenue retention rate in the quarter.

For the fiscal first quarter, Snowflake’s management expects $568 million to $573 million in product revenue, whereas the FactSet consensus was for $582 million.

For the full year, Snowflake executives expect $2.705 billion in product revenue, representing 40% growth from a year before. The FactSet consensus was for $2.826 billion. Snowflake gave an initial full-year product revenue forecast calling for 47% growth on its prior earnings call in late November.

The company also disclosed that it has received authorization for a share-repurchase program of up to $2 billion.

Shares of Snowflake have shed more than 40% over the past 12 months, as the S&P 500 index [**SPX,** **-0.47%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) has lost about 8%.",2023-03-01,155,74

**Last Week – Typical Holiday Trading**

SPY rose 1.6% last week, in line with the 1.5% move options were pricing. Retail stocks helped continue the recent rally and the FOMC meeting minutes confirmed some market assumptions on the Fed’s next moves. Day-to-day volatility was also subdued and volumes light. Implied volatility again fell. The VIX finished the week at 20.50, its lowest close since mid-August. VIX futures are now steeply in contango with Jan VIX futures above 25 and March above 26. SPY 30-day IV is just 19, 60-day is 20 and 90-day is just 21. So SPY options are near historical averages across the board while VIX futures continue to price high 20’s out a few months.

**This Week – Economic Calendar Picks Back Up, Culminates on Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are again pricing just a 1.5% move for the upcoming week, but option premium contracted a lot to account for no trading on Thursday and a half day on Friday to end last week. There’s nothing market makers hate more than getting plugged with premium into a quasi 4-day weekend and that explains a lot of the IV drop last week. IV typically reflexes the other way on a Monday open following a long weekend.

Last week we highlighted a possible phenomenon that falling IV after sustained high IV (like we just saw) can have a bit of a snowball effect on both option pricing and actual market movement as the selling loads the market with gamma:

>File this under a “way too early to know” category, but one thing traders should be aware of is that falling implied volatility can be a self-fulfilling prophecy on realized (actual) market volatility **The TLDR version is that it can load the market with gamma that may act as a governor on market moves as there are deltas to be bought lower and deltas to be sold higher.**

That’s something worth keeping an eye on but with the NFP Jobs number this week and the FOMC December meeting on the 14th, there are a few potential market-moving events that could keep options bid. In fact, the expected move chart shows higher volatility for this Friday and the FOMC week (note the FOMC week in particular as IV jumps from 15 to 20 and expected moves expand, it looks like a stock does into earnings):

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bk140ef9yk2a1.gif

What that means is that even if market moves stay muted for now, options will have to keep the some key upcoming dates on the radar and price an assumption of volatility those days. That effect on IV may be less noticeable in individual stocks but traders should apply the same assumptions, particularly in stocks with close ties to interest rates and currencies.

The economic calendar this week has the aforementioned Jobs Number, but some other important events like the GDP number and a Powell speech/ Beige Book.

**Last Week – Typical Holiday Trading**

SPY rose 1.6% last week, in line with the 1.5% move options were pricing. Retail stocks helped continue the recent rally and the FOMC meeting minutes confirmed some market assumptions on the Fed’s next moves. Day-to-day volatility was also subdued and volumes light. Implied volatility again fell. The VIX finished the week at 20.50, its lowest close since mid-August. VIX futures are now steeply in contango with Jan VIX futures above 25 and March above 26. SPY 30-day IV is just 19, 60-day is 20 and 90-day is just 21. So SPY options are near historical averages across the board while VIX futures continue to price high 20’s out a few months.

**This Week – Economic Calendar Picks Back Up, Culminates on Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are again pricing just a 1.5% move for the upcoming week, but option premium contracted a lot to account for no trading on Thursday and a half day on Friday to end last week. There’s nothing market makers hate more than getting plugged with premium into a quasi 4-day weekend and that explains a lot of the IV drop last week. IV typically reflexes the other way on a Monday open following a long weekend.

Last week we highlighted a possible phenomenon that falling IV after sustained high IV (like we just saw) can have a bit of a snowball effect on both option pricing and actual market movement as the selling loads the market with gamma:

>File this under a “way too early to know” category, but one thing traders should be aware of is that falling implied volatility can be a self-fulfilling prophecy on realized (actual) market volatility **The TLDR version is that it can load the market with gamma that may act as a governor on market moves as there are deltas to be bought lower and deltas to be sold higher.**

That’s something worth keeping an eye on but with the NFP Jobs number this week and the FOMC December meeting on the 14th, there are a few potential market-moving events that could keep options bid. In fact, the expected move chart shows higher volatility for this Friday and the FOMC week (note the FOMC week in particular as IV jumps from 15 to 20 and expected moves expand, it looks like a stock does into earnings):

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bk140ef9yk2a1.gif

What that means is that even if market moves stay muted for now, options will have to keep the some key upcoming dates on the radar and price an assumption of volatility those days. That effect on IV may be less noticeable in individual stocks but traders should apply the same assumptions, particularly in stocks with close ties to interest rates and currencies.

The economic calendar this week has the aforementioned Jobs Number, but some other important events like the GDP number and a Powell speech/ Beige Book.

Situation

New IPO, highly volatile, attractive segment, rapid growth, solid financials, extreme valuation, sign of a slowdown

•	IPO at $120 in Sept 2000, share price briefly traded above $400 before declining 67% to current level around $130

•	Selling analytics software (AS) and providing cloud data warehouse (CDW) services to enterprises

•	FY22 (end Jan 30 2021) revenue (REV) $1.2 bn (up 106% YOY), backlog $2.6 bn (up 98% YOY), gross margin (GM) 74%

•	Credible mgmt., solid balance sheet ($5.1 bn cash and $205 mm debt), cash flow positive, but not profitable yet

•	Market cap of $43 bn, at a price to sales ratio of 36, forward price to earnings over 1000, and PEG above 5

Analysis

Growth to slow, fierce competition, negative environment to get worse, valuation needs to further normalize 

•	Slowdown inevitable after explosive growth during the pandemic, and amid recent market turmoil

	Sector growth still healthy but moderated, as seen in recent AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL ERs before market turmoil

	SNOW relied on B2C businesses - financial, retail, advertising, health care, and tech accounts for 85% of REV

	In Q4 FY22 call, mgmt. noted REV headwind but attributed to software upgrade and new pricing model

	FY23 growth guided lower, distress in core verticals, and recent SNAP negative update all indicate a slowdown

•	Competition fierce and likely to intensify, SNOW’s growth profile cannot justify an excessive valuation premium 

	SNOW bundles its analytic software (AS) with CDW offerings from AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGLE to sell to its clients

	AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL bundle their own AS and CDW, compete directly with SNOW

	Players swiftly copy one another, making their offerings difficult to distinguish, it is a constant arms race

	SNOW has to compete with dominate players (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL) with much larger R&D budget and staff, with legacy players (IBM, ORCL, etc.) beefing up their cloud offerings, and with new entrants (DDOG, HPE, etc.) 

	At REV of $1.2 bn, SNOW is very small compared to the cloud businesses of the dominant players but traded at a huge premium.  However, competition quickly drives its growth toward sector mean (roughly 40-50% in 2021)

	As pandemic recedes and growth further slows, competition likely to intensify, given the enormous investment in the space with numerous players of little differentiation competing for a smaller pie 

•	Macro environment took a turn for the worse

	NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 dropped roughly 30% and 20% amid high inflation, rate hike and QT, war, lockdown

	Fed hiked rate twice, 75 bps total, far away from the 300 bps expected, and has not even begun QT

	Early signs of severe economic slowdown are everywhere, and inflation remains high with April CPI at 8.3%

a.	New home sales down 16.6% in April after a 10.5% decline in March, 30-year mortgage rate at 5.5%

b.	Retailer inventory to sales at 30-40% (WMT, TGT, HD, KSS, etc.), a ratio normally ranging at +/-10%

c.	Firms began hiring freeze or firing (FB, NFLX, etc.), and guided earnings drastically lower (SNAP, ANF, etc.)

	Pressure mounting on Fed. Some market commentators and noted investors call for “shock and awe” tightening to defeat the inflation

	No alternatives for the Fed other than at the minimum to follow through its own plan of rate hikes and QT, against backdrop of a rapidly decelerating economy, elevating risks of a recession in 2023 or sooner

	Macro uncertainties will suppress demand and thus the growth of SNOW, regardless if there will be a recession

•	SNOW’s extreme valuation is incompatible with its growth profile and the near term macro and market outlook

Conclusion

•	SNOW share price likely to decline significantly more near term, even if ER meets or marginally beats expectations

p9n21y_SNOW,SNOW,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD (or sell CSPs): DKNG, SNOW, DPZ, PYPL, TSM","# Last Week’s Review

The SPY and QQQ ended flat last week while IWM and small-caps closed down -1%. The market did not react well to the Fed hinting of a potential taper by the end of 2021 or early 2022. Growth names took a beating, but most of last week’s list performed relatively well being down only 2-3%.

Jackson hole Fed meeting, virtually, is taking place this Friday August 28 and will be a big tell in what’s to happen next for the market. They will discuss economic policies that, as we know, rule over the stock market and dictate where valuations should be. If you are an investor this will be a key event to keep an eye on. Due to the meeting I will be trading light this week, but I’ve still put together a few names on my watch-list down below.

&#x200B;

The market is in a peculiar place. We have:

* Retail sales lower than expected
* China retail sales lower than expected
* China stocks still in hot lava
* Fed saying it’s time to taper
* Inflation being transitory and also maybe not transitory
* Covid news flip-flopping daily between good and bad

&#x200B;

There is more information than the market can even digest, which is a possible factor for this increase in volatility and choppiness.

&#x200B;

I want to eventually get into all the details of how I find stocks to choose from. It’s really nothing fancy like boilinger bands or ichimoku clouds, but rather simple technicals such as support and resistance lines, moving averages, and trend channels.

&#x200B;

There will never be a clear leading indicator of when to buy or sell a stock for max profit. Most of it is knowing about the stock/company and finding a reasonable entry point for it, like we’ve been doing with out “Buy The Dip” charts. Next week I’ll cover some of these charting and technicals a bit more in-depth, but for now I’ll leave you with several questions I ask myself before entering the play.

&#x200B;

* Is the company fundamentally strong? If not, am I playing a bounce or what is my game-plan, aka how long will I hold the position?
* Is the stock in an up-trend? If yes, is it near the top of the channel, or at the lower trend-line and a decent entry?
* Is the stock in a down-trend? Has the stock price settled or bottomed? If yes a base might be forming. If not, am I catching this knife because I think the share price over-reacted to bad news? Is the company still trading at ridiculous PE or P/S? Did the company’s moat get threatened? Has growth slowed?
* Am I trading on stock hype? Has the hype died off and provided a potential entry, AKA my green/orange/red zones? Am I FOMOing into the trade or should I re-visit this stock in 7 days and see if it’s still something I want to buy.

&#x200B;

These are all important questions to ask yourself before you enter any position. Figure out your game-plan and strategy and fine-tune it into something that works for you.

&#x200B;

What do a pizza, gambling, and tech stock have in common? Nothing, but let’s buy the Fing dip.

&#x200B;

# The MEME List

**DraftKings (DKNG)**

https://preview.redd.it/8s5zajbrpzi71.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd20aed890bd535e8de05ed1fdd9dabd3cd27899

DKNG had a great run up to $70 earlier this year, but since then it saw a steady decline, with most other growth stocks, back to the $40 level. Looking at the 50 EMA line it was clear that it was in a downtrend, but it just recently crossed back over. I wouldn't say an uptrend is confirmed just yet, but we are almost there. This may prove to be a good entry and I'm willing to take the risk on this fairly risk-averse play.

There is potential it could drop back to $45 level, but IMO this could also be a $75 stock. I see 10-20% downside risk with 50% potential upside and that is a risk-reward I prefer.

&#x200B;

**Snowflake (SNOW)**

https://preview.redd.it/yqpiwkyrpzi71.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=566d8b20a657abf145c1b299142dfbb6fc1fca5d

The over-hyped IPO of SNOW that shot the stock up to over $400 per share and eventually into a quick reversal back to the high $200's. I added an orange zone box to show where the stock started to bottom out. SNOW has lost most of it’s volatility that surrounded the IPO and since May has been on a SLOW grind back up. SNOW is down 8% over the last 5-trading sessions and is sitting at the 50 EMA (orange line). I'll be looking for a bounce off this line.

&#x200B;

# The BTFD List

**Paypal (PYPL)**

https://preview.redd.it/9y31ffispzi71.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=7752d2fdaf2c6cb822a8b90a1684dddea361f93a

Paypal stock dropped recently on earnings after Ebay announced a transition to their own managed payments system. PYPL did post impressive earnings, but had soft guidance for Q4 and the stock tumbled.

Unlike meme stocks PYPL's trends have been steady and consistent. Looking at the chart it just recently dipped below the 50 EMA to potentially form a reversal (but not yet), and is sitting at the 100 EMA where I am looking for a bounce. Should we lose this level I might exit the position as the trend would be confirmed to the downside and potentially $240.

&#x200B;

**Dominoes Pizza (DPZ)**

https://preview.redd.it/oouz0k4tpzi71.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bf6d69ce71c1c22ac70f6683a482c4b0b41157

Led by international expansions and strong domestic growth Dominoes pizza has been one of the most out-performing stocks of 2021. Similar to PYPL above it has been on an extremely consistent uptrend. The recent 5% dip has given an entry point and IMO any dip to the 50 EMA can also provide an entry. The stock is also hitting some over-sold indicators which would agree with my bias.

**Taiwan Semis Manufacturing (TSM)**

The semi-shortage has been affecting many industries. With how cyclical production can be analysts are nervous about the over-production and over-supply that might eventually hit. However, I expect chip demand to remain robust for the foreseeable future. TSM was trading in a range for almost 6 months and oversold levels are starting to show, but IMO this is a value play. TSM trading at a much lower PE relative to their competitors of NVDA and AMD, and not getting much love. To be able to buy this name back at almost the same price as 9 months ago is a value entry.

**Last Week –** **SPY** was lower by about 0.5%, inside the 0.7% expected move options were pricing. However, the market was lower mid-week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $444 that corresponds to about **$439** as a *bearish expected move* and **$448** as a *bullish expected move*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was above 23 during the week, but closed around 18.50 on Friday following the market rally that ended the week. That is about in line with its historical average. The futures curve is upward sloping with December VIX futures around 23, up from 22 last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

The market ETFs are all pricing larger moves this week than last week:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.3%**
* IWM **2.1%**
* DIA **1.3%**

### In the News

The market’s move lower last week saw some demand for option volatility as the VIX quickly spiked towards the mid 20s. With the VIX now back in the teens and VIX December futures near 23, options are pricing about a 7% move by year end.

A Debit Put Spread to that level, buying the at-the-money 443 puts and selling a put at the Bearish Expected Move of 413 costs about 8.00 and breaks-even at about 435. It costs about 1.8% of the underlying but protects against about 5% of the 7% move options are currently pricing. For those looking for portfolio protection, those ratios and breakevens are one way to analyze potential hedges:

otkmgl_SNOW,SNOW,Let it SNOW,"Does anyone else watch or track SNOW. This is a name I continually watch daily along a few others, like S&P of course. This really helps me with FOMO and to avoid over trading. Anyways, imo, SNOW is bullish and looking like it might trade at 285 soon. 

There are a few reasons what line up with my bullish thesis:

1. Anchored VWAP - I have anchored VWAP from ATH, ATL, and from inception and they are all coming together in current price range. This could create a massive VWAP pinch, similiar to the VWAP NVDA had weeks ago
2. Gamma Exposure - We are currently sitting in positive gamma as long as we continue to close above 260
3. Weekly chart shows very bullish set up

&#x200B;

Depending on your option trading style, I'd prefer a call calendar spread.

nljpih_SNOW,SNOW,SNOW and NVDA earnings. Expected moves and a look at credit spreads.,"Nvidia and Snowflake report after the bell Wednesday. The options market is pricing just under a 4% move for Nvidia and just under a 7% move for Snowflake.

**Nvidia /** [Expected Move: **3.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NVDA)/ Recent earnings moves: -8%, 0%, 0%

**Snowflake** / [Expected Move: **6.6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SNOW) / Recent earnings moves: +1%, +16%  


I generally lean towards credit spreads into events where vol will fall after the fact. I wanted to lay out what I generally look at as far as credit spreads, using the expected move then comparing risk/reward and probability of profit.

### Snowflake

At the time of writing, SNOW stock is about $230. The 6.6% expected move corresponds to about $214 and $240 in the stock.  First I want to look at ""Selling the move” entirely via an Iron Condor, with a credit put spread placed at the bearish consensus and a credit call spread at the bullish consensus:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5pr1sseceh171.gif

An Iron Condor is a credit spread that looks to make money if the stock stays within the strikes In this case, the Condor risks around $140 to make up to $110 if the stock stays between $215 and $245 on Friday’s expiration. (the spreads are each 2.5 wide).

## NVIDIA

At the time of writing, NVIDIA is about $625. Its expected move of 3.7% corresponds to about $605 and $652.

Here’s a look at an Iron Condor with credit call and put spreads at those levels:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i7uml8xreh171.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=c182ffce439bfce299d33265e981e986b90ec89e

This one is 5 wide on each spread and decent risk/reward.

Of course Condors are entirely neutral, credit spreads can also be used directionally by ""selling the move"" in one direction. Here's a look at how the credit spreads based on the expected move look in NVDA, first bullish, showing both at ATM spread, and also an OTM example, down near the bearish expected move:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jej3xih8fh171.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0fd5c818d0ca4272091d1676c24ac9e52fa7e28

And the ""bearish"" credit call spreads:

https://preview.redd.it/ebwkmgy4fh171.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfc453c277d22beb70c5011ba93c6a09f3d1852

Credit spreads obviously risk more to make less. And the higher their probability of profit, the more that needs to be risked to make less. But for those curious about credit spreads, particularly into an event where vol typically falls afterwards.

The other trade I didn't mention is an Iron Butterfly which is similar to the Condor above but has such a specific target for max gain it's almost a better trade for those with a specific price target in mind. 

Or course, if a stock rips higher or crashes, credit spreads and falling vol don't matter! As a credit spread can become max loss. But defining risk via a spread rather than an outright short call or put gives a calculable risk/reward that can be easily compared to debit calls/puts or spreads to determine f the risk/reward is worth the higher probability of profit.",2021-05-26,34,18

Here’s an example of using the expected move to generate an Iron Condor that “sells the move” in CRM. The Condor looks to profit if CRM stays within its expected move following earnings. It is a max gain between 212.50 and 232.50. If the stock moves beyond what options are pricing, the Condor is a max loss (with defined risk):

lusjsz_SNOW,SNOW,"Expected moves for the week, SPY, Zoom, NIO, Snowflake, Slack and more.","A quick roundup of expected moves via the options market for this week. Expected moves are useful for spotting opportunity or managing risk but they are also important for trade strategies in options themselves, for instance with strike selection. I'll start with SPY, also check in on Gamestop, before looking at companies reporting earnings this week. With the earnings stocks, I've included their prior earnings actual moves for comparison. 

In case I missed something you're tracking, a searchable list with the expected move and prior earnings moves can be found on the Options AI calendar. Here's an example in [Zoom ZM](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ZM). Feel free to bookmark and use that, it's free. These moves are based on Friday's closing prices in options and will look slightly different on the open tomorrow.

**SPY** \- With the VIX around 28, SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move this week:

**Gamestop GME** is kind of wild (as you know), but what's really wild is that it reports earnings later this month and has a 75% expected move for the month, but it ain't because of earnings, no one cares about that. Its expected move for this week alone is 45%. In other words, it's all about the weekly options and retail demand for not so cheap upside calls:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zb5cdzqyjak61.gif

Speaking of Gamestop, I wrote again last week about how nuts the options are and that they're practically giving away call spreads when compared to out-of-the-money calls. Also, how directional butterflies can be used for bearish positioning, as implied volatility usually gets killed in these stocks as they go lower and out of the money puts can get crushed even while getting the direction right. Worth a read if you're involved in Gamestop or any similar stocks, the article is on LEARN [here](https://learn.optionsai.com/gamestop-and-high-volatility-options/) and is very similar to a post I wrote on r/options a few weeks ago. You heard it here first :)

 [Snowflake Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SNOW:US) rallied by the most in a month on Thursday despite the expiration of a second lockup freeing company insiders from selling restrictions on tens of millions of shares.

Snowflake shares rose as much as 12% and touched an intraday off about $301 amid a broad advance in technology and financial stocks. The gains were part of a broader rally led by technology and financial stocks as investors bet that Democratic control of Congress and the White House will usher in more economic stimulus.

 The cloud-computing company, which briefly [topped](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/snowflake-surges-past-ibm-with-market-value-at-120-billion) $110 billion in market value last month, said in a Dec. 29 [filing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QM4GDBGIPVYE) that an estimated 37.9 million shares would become eligible for sale at the open of trading Thursday.

  Investors have bid up Snowflake shares to gain exposure to the company’s rapid revenue growth, which is projected to exceed 80% in fiscal 2022. While the stock has more than doubled since debuting in September, it has fallen about 9% since the [first lockup expired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/snowflake-market-value-losses-top-20-billion-as-lockup-expires) on Dec. 15.

 \------

 Cloud-based data warehousing company Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) saw its stock decline by almost 30% over the last month. While not much really changed on the ground for Snowflake, which is on track to more than double revenues this fiscal year, there are a couple of factors that have likely driven the sell-off. Firstly, Snowflake stock remains very richly valued trading at over 130x consensus FY’21 Revenues and is up by about 130% from its IPO price. Considering these big gains, investors are likely booking some profits. Secondly, in mid-December Snowflake saw its first lockup release post its IPO, allowing employees to sell 25% of their vested options. While this only had a limited impact, investors are likely concerned that the full lock-up expiration, which happens this March, will put a lot more pressure on the stock. Snowflake’s float, or the shares available to investors for trading, stands at just about 18% of its total shares outstanding currently. Thirdly, with Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out globally, investors could be rethinking their allocation to cloud computing stocks which were a hot theme through the pandemic, while shifting to more value bets. This could also be a factor hurting Snowflake stock. 

\----

what do people think, will there be a large sell off tomorrow? Is it currently overvalued? Will it sell off when it unlocks in March? Does it have a fighting chance against big tech? Is their low float (10% of outstanding shares) causing the high valuation and run up?",2021-01-07,13,15

klhgh8_SNOW,SNOW,The 'Tutes' vs PLTR compared to SNOW and AI... and why PLTR is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for retail investors (until now... ),"It should surprise no one that Institutional Investors and Hedge Funds love the traditional IPO process: a company wants to raise money and provide liquidity for their stock, so they engage the entrenched financial industry in a process of listing shares on a public exchange to raise capital to fund growth.

The underwriters organize a horse show to hype the stock to the Tutes, whonunderstand that a similar barrage of media hype will be produced to stoke the fires of retail demand. The company gets funded, often above their initially defined goals, and the Tutes get in at a price that leaves plenty of room for a 'pop' on the debut of the stock's trading: when retail investors hungry for the opportunity to own the stock pay market value at whatever price shares start trading, the Tutes make instant profits.

SNOW and AI both conformed to the industry paradigm, performed traditional IPOs, and despite being egregiously overvalued,  have continued to rise from even their debut prices to push the limits of valuation to absurd levels (I'm not talking about IPO prices, but the prices at which they started trading).

I have no problem with the 'forward looking growth'' theory behind the valuation of these stocks, but the more I research and understand the business models behind SNOW, Ai, and PLTR, the more I feel the IPO industry is simply punishing PLTR for doing a direct listing rather than performing an IPO that would have given the Tutes their presumably entitled benefits.

Let's pause for moment to explain this to anyone who doesn't understand the traditional IPO process vs direct listings.

SNOW and AI both entered public trading on the stock market through the traditional IPO process. Both companies are burning through cash faster than they are earning it, and opted to raise their next round of financing by engaging with a group of underwriters (Goldman, Merril, etc) to create a bunch of new shares and sell them - generally these shares are sold to institutional investors: hedge funds, pension funds, high net worth individuals,  and other 'smart money' pools of significant capital. Retail investors (you and me) are left out. 

For weeks, the company, with the guidance (connections provided by) their underwriters, pitch their company to these Tutes, and the Tutes have decades long relationships with these underwriters upon which they understand that this process is designed to ensure their mutual profit.  There is an entire indistry built around launching these IPOs to ensure that the Tutes make an instant profit by allowing them to purchase shares at a price that meets the debuting company's financial goals, while a parallel media mechanism is deployed that hypes and justifies relatively absurd valuations to retail investors. The end result being a process where Tutes are able to buy a stock at an IPO price that is significantly less than the price at which retail investors can buy it later in the day.

SNOW IPO price: $120.
SNOW debut trading price: $245

AI IPO price: $42
AI debut trading price: $101

Ok, crazy, right?
But here's the thing, the 'analysts' and major publications that influence retail investment behaviour all supported these valuations as though they were justified by future growth expectations! All they talked about was the importance of data analytics and artificial intelligence. No hesitation, no doubt, no talk about risk or downside, just pure unadulterated pump and hype.

Funny thing is, SNOW and AI seem to be as closely aligned in terms of business model to PLTR as any other products/services I have researched. All 3 provide software services that allow large organizations to more effectively aggregate, visualize, and apply AI to large data sets for the ultimate purpose of making critical business decisions. 

But here's the thing... when PLTR decided to float their stock on the public exchange via a direct listing, rather than through a typical IPO process, the Tutes got left out... and they were clearly pissed.

The number of disinformation articles I read that tried to paint Palantir as just a consultancy, with too much exposure to a particular political party or government contracts in general, or lack of profitability (despite being cash flow positive), was a clear relflection of the industry's attempt to punish and apply downward pressure on the PLTR share price.

Funny thing is, we now know that many hedge funds have been loading up on PLTR while their media counterparts were depressing the share price. I expect we'll learn that more have been doing the same since then, and I suspect that many have been hoping to keep the share price as low as possible until the lockup period expires sometime in Feb/March.

It's pretty ridiculous when an analyst like Barron's downgrades the stock rating while simultaneously increasing their price target from just a month previous by nearly 50%.

It seems that almost everyday I read an article that chastises the retail investment market for pumping PLTR to a share price that equates to a 50x revenue multiple, yet they are ok with SNOW trading at a revenue multiple of over 175x, AI trading at over 90x. Meanwhile SNOW and AI generated revenue in the $250M ballpark in the last year, while PLTR posted over $1B.

PLTR direct listed their shares on Sept 30, 2020 at $10/share, and unlike SNOW and AI, did not feel the need to raise amy funds in the process. You would think that indicated financial strength for a company.

Had PLTR gone public via a traditional IPO and followed the trend of every other tech related stock to IPO this year, the IPO price may have started at $10 and inflated to an IPO price in the $20-30 range before debuting for retail trading in the $50-60 range.

With the IPO industry's promotional hype and backing, the stock likely goes up from there, or at least holds and pops on every new government contract headline.

Instead, the Tutes played a game of disinformation - holding the price down below $10 for the first month of trading while quietly building their positions. But then the silent period expired, earnings were released, the cat got out of the bag, and even Shitron Tweets could only temporarily subdue the rally.

It seems like the only headwind in site is the lockup period. And with plenty of involvement with Covid vaccine rollout, seemingly weekly new government contracts, upcoming promotional events, and a lilely stellar ER, there's no reason not to expect PLTR to soon join the lofty valuations of SNOW and AI in the upcoming months.

+++

... and here's why this opportunity to buy in alongside, instead of after, the Tutes take their positions.

This past week, the NYSE approved the decision to allow companies to do a direct listing WHILE raising additional capital for their company in the process (PLTR did a direct listing without raising additional funds).
The incentive for companies to pursue the traditional IPO process, which has proven to leave substantial funds on the table, while primarily benefitting the underwriters and their clients (the Tutes), may be significantly disrupted. 

And similarly to the way in which SPACs have provided more parity for retail investors to buy into stocks before Tutes have taken their pound of flesh, the next round of direct listings should provide previously unavailable opportunities for retail investors to take positions in newly traded companies at levels alongside, rather than underneath, those of institutional investors. 

Am praying that Roblox and a few other upcoming debuts decide to follow this path as well.

Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a tremendous Put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.

&#x200B;

* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:

1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.
2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct.
3. The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.

* The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales.
   * Snow CEO makes $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can't imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this
* Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book.
   * Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market
* Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially.
* The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.
* Since my balls don't drag on the ground when I walk, I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. Positions below, $10k in each.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts.

Snowflake shares surged more than 150% in its market debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, in the largest ever software IPO. 

Stock began trading at $245 per share before being halted due to volatility. Snowflake on Tuesday priced shares at $120, higher than the $100 to $110 range it estimated on Monday, and a huge bump from the $75 to $85 range it proposed in a filing last week.

The company is on track to book $500M revenue for 2020, implies a 67 multiple in valuation, one of the highest (if not the highest) among public SAAS companies by quite a bit. 


>Snowflake, a provider of cloud-based data storage and analysis software, priced its IPO above its increased range in an offering that values the company at $33.3 billion.

>	Snowflake is selling 28 million shares at $120 a piece, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the pricing hasn’t been made public. The company, which is poised to debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol “SNOW,” is the first of several technology companies to go public this week in one of the busiest stretches of the year. Snowflake will raise approximately $3.4 billion from the offering.

>	Investors are bidding up Snowflake’s ahead of the offering as they anticipate a blockbuster opening for a company that’s generating over $500 million in annualized revenue and grew over 130% in the first half of the year. The company had already raised its anticipated debut price range from a maximum of $85 to a max of $110 in the space of less than a week. Snowflake is growing alongside the major public cloud vendors by providing technology that allows clients to quickly analyze and share vast amounts of data and increase capacity as needed, rather than relying on databases that are tied to hardware.

>	Last week, Snowflake revealed in a filing that Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce each agreed to buy $250 million of stock at the IPO price in a concurrent private placement. Berkshire Hathaway also agreed to buy 4.04 million shares in a secondary transaction from former CEO Bob Muglia. Based on the IPO price, Berkshire will be paying $484.8 million for those shares. 

>	Snowflake is entering a market that’s hungry for high-growth cloud software makers, particularly those that have shown an ability to continue expanding through the coronavirus pandemic. Even after pulling back this month, the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index, consisting of over 50 publicly traded companies, is up about 55% this year, compared to a 25% gain for the Nasdaq and 5.3% advance in the S&P 500.

>	Zoom’s stock is up over 500% in 2020, and Fastly has jumped more than 300%. DocuSign, Shopify and Datadog have more than doubled.

**Edit** As of right now $SNOW is trading at $240, that’s 130x multiple, or 50% higher than even the crazily valued Zoom.

It’s currently the 3rd highest valued SAAS company at a valuation of close to $70B, with multiple thats 6x higher than ServiceNow, 10 times higher than Salesforce.
