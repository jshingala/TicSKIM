1j91ojf_PATH,PATH,Investing thesis: SoFi (SOFI),"**SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI)**¬†is no longer just a student loan lender. It has evolved into a full-fledged financial powerhouse, seamlessly integrating lending, banking, and fintech infrastructure. The company has spent the past few years building an ecosystem designed to capture customers early and keep them engaged across multiple financial products. The result? A business model that scales, a growing base of high-value customers, and a path to long-term profitability that is finally materializing. The stock has been volatile, but for long-term investors, SoFi presents a compelling story of transformation, execution, and untapped potential.

SoFi‚Äôs ambition is straightforward‚Äîbecome the¬†**single destination for financial needs**. It started with student loans but quickly expanded into¬†**personal loans, mortgages,**¬†and¬†**credit cards**. Then came¬†**SoFi Bank**, which allows it to take deposits and fund loans internally, giving it a¬†**significant cost advantage over fintech competitors**¬†that rely on partner banks. On top of that, SoFi operates¬†**Galileo and Technisys**, technology platforms that¬†**provide banking infrastructure to other companies**. This three-pronged approach‚Äî**lending, financial services,**¬†and¬†**technology**‚Äîcreates a powerful ecosystem where customers can move seamlessly between products, increasing their lifetime value while keeping acquisition costs in check.

Owning its bank gives SoFi a strategic edge. Most fintechs don‚Äôt have access to customer deposits and must rely on external funding sources, which can become expensive or unstable in volatile markets.¬†**SoFi‚Äôs deposits‚Äînow around $25 billion‚Äîserve as a low-cost funding base for its loans**, strengthening its competitive positioning. The company has also leaned into cross-selling, leveraging its expanding customer base to introduce new services and deepen engagement.¬†**The end goal is clear: keep customers within the SoFi ecosystem for life**.

SoFi‚Äôs greatest strength is its integration of financial services under one roof. Traditional banks offer breadth but often lack the technology-driven, user-friendly experience that defines modern fintech. On the other hand, most fintech startups specialize in one area‚Äîeither banking, lending, or investing‚Äîwithout the ability to cross-sell effectively. SoFi sits in the middle, with both breadth and digital agility, giving it a distinct edge.

**The company‚Äôs national brand awareness**, aided by high-profile marketing campaigns like¬†**SoFi Stadium**, adds another layer of strength. This recognition helps it attract high-income, tech-savvy customers‚Äîthose who are more likely to¬†**take out larger loans**,¬†**keep higher deposit balances**, and¬†**adopt multiple financial products**. Customer stickiness is further reinforced by SoFi‚Äôs aggressive cross-selling strategy, where a personal loan customer is nudged toward a checking account, then a credit card, then an investment portfolio.

The biggest challenge is competition from legacy banks and emerging fintechs. Large banks still have scale, regulatory advantages, and deeply entrenched customer bases, while fintech startups continue innovating on user experience and pricing. But SoFi‚Äôs ability to blend fintech innovation with banking infrastructure gives it a fighting chance to carve out a durable moat.

SoFi‚Äôs numbers tell a story of rapid expansion and a long-awaited shift toward profitability.¬†**Revenue has skyrocketed from $565 million in 2020 to $2.64 billion in 2024, representing a blistering \~70% CAGR**. Even as the base grows, SoFi continues to post strong growth, with¬†**2024 revenue increasing 26% year-over-year**.¬†**The company has finally turned GAAP profitable, reporting $499 million in net income for 2024**, though this figure includes tax benefits. Adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded to 26%, demonstrating operating leverage as revenue scales.

Loan originations continue to drive growth, with SoFi issuing $23.3 billion in loans in 2024, particularly fueled by personal loans and a revival in student loan refinancing. Meanwhile,¬†**customer deposits have grown to \~$25 billion**, providing stable, low-cost funding that enhances SoFi‚Äôs margins.

SoFi‚Äôs growth story is far from over. Personal loans and student loan refinancing continue to expand, but the real upside lies in its banking and technology segments. As deposits grow, SoFi can generate more interest income, improving profitability. Galileo and Technisys, its banking technology platforms, provide another lever for growth‚Äîif SoFi can scale these businesses by signing more enterprise clients, they could become high-margin revenue streams that complement its consumer banking arm.

New products will also play a role. SoFi has already entered wealth management, credit cards, and insurance, and it may push into small business banking in the future. The company has the ability to experiment quickly, leveraging its bank infrastructure to test and deploy new offerings with minimal friction.

Macroeconomic factors remain a wildcard. Interest rates impact borrowing demand, and a broader economic slowdown could weigh on loan growth. But SoFi has positioned itself well, building a diversified business that isn‚Äôt overly reliant on any single revenue stream.

**SoFi‚Äôs valuation looks attractive at \~$12-13 per share**, and its trajectory will depend on execution.

* **Base Case (\~$15-16, \~20% upside)**: If SoFi maintains \~20% revenue growth and expands net margins to 10%+, the stock could command a price-to-sales multiple of \~4√ó, making the current valuation reasonable with moderate upside.
* **Bull Case (\~$20-22, \~60% upside)**: If financial services and Galileo scale faster than expected, with net margins reaching 15%+, SoFi could see a re-rating toward a P/S of \~5√ó, pushing the stock into the $20+ range.
* **Bear Case (\~$6-8, \~40% downside)**: If macro headwinds slow growth, credit performance deteriorates, or regulatory pressures mount, SoFi could be valued more like a traditional bank at \~2√ó sales, leading to significant downside.

At current prices,¬†**SoFi offers an attractive long-term opportunity for investors willing to tolerate volatility**. The company is executing well, turning profitable, and expanding into new areas, but the stock will likely remain choppy in the short term.

SoFi isn‚Äôt a moonshot anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs a real, growing, profitable financial company with a clear vision. It has spent years building out its ecosystem, and now it‚Äôs beginning to reap the rewards. The bank charter, the cross-selling strategy, the technology infrastructure‚Äîthese are real, durable advantages that should continue compounding over time.

**Closing Remarks:**

**""Anthony Noto**¬†\--¬†*Chief Executive Officer*

Thank you. And thank you for everyone for joining the call today. Over the past seven years, we faced challenge after challenge in external environment impacting our business, our members, and our team. In each time, through our innovation and tenacity, we were able to run to daylight and come out even stronger than before.

The result is a more diversified, resilient, battle-tested business, and, most critically, a gritty team that finds a way to win. As I've said before, we love hard. Hard is the path to durability. Hard is the path to differentiation.

And hard is the path of being the absolute best.¬†**We entered 2025 with the best business environment we've had in my time at SoFi.**¬†But regardless of that outlook, rest assured, we are battle ready. And while I'm confident our best days are yet to come, you should rest assured we will work harder and smarter than ever before to be the best in everything we do and to continue to build the SoFi way.

Thank you for your interest and support in our great company.""",2025-01-28,47,2

1ib7lm2_SOFI,SOFI,Sofi earnings - beats on top and bottom lines but a large drop premarket,"Sofi announced their 4th quarter 2024 earnings and their ceo declared 2024 as their best year ever. Reaching profitability and continue to grow customer base, AUM and revenues, the ceo indicated that for 2025 they would shift some focus to investments in the business and the long term strategy. 


This may be another case of buy the rumor, sell the news. Sofi had a banner year and people flooded into the stock raising is from around the $6 mark to $18. But after going 3x in a year it seems like investors may be ready to sell off some of those huge gains having seen the growth materialize and a potential shift in focus for 2025, and beyond. 



Some key 2024 numbers:



Record Adjusted Net Revenue Grew 24% Driven by 52% Combined Growth in Financial Services and Tech Platform Segments, Representing 49% of Total Adjusted Net Revenue

34% Growth in Members and 32% Growth in Products in 2024 Remain Key Drivers of Growth

Record Fee Based Revenue of $289 Million Increased 63%, Reinforcing Strength of Increased Mix of Higher ROE Revenue


2025 guidance remakes:



For the full year 2025, management expects to deliver adjusted net revenue of $3.200 to $3.275 billion, which equates to approximately 23 to 26% year-over-year growth. Management expects adjusted EBITDA of $845 to $865 million, which equates to an incremental EBITDA margin of 30%, in line with our long term investment philosophy. We expect GAAP net income of $285 to $305 million, with an incremental margin of 20% when excluding 2024 non-recurring income tax benefits and gains on convertible notes. Lastly, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.25 to $0.27 cents per share. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 26%, which we currently believe to be our effective tax rate in 2025.",2025-01-27,93,32

I thought Robinhood would actively try to get people to transfer in but I see little support. With Robinhood Gold and an IRA transfer, they give you a 3% match and refund up to $75 of any transfer fees from the originating bank. In my case, I just get $75 of a $100 fee reimbursed. Robinhood‚Äôs help desk recommended that I just wait until they offer a match promotion for transfers, which happens ‚Äúoften.‚Äù

My questions are about how I should proceed. I could just liquidate all my holdings and transfer cash to Robinhood. I could also just do a standard ACAT transfer and eat the fees. Or I could stick with SoFi until I figure out an advantageous way of doing the transfer.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has other ideas or things I should watch out for. For example, do i unnecessarily accrue an extra tax burden by liquidating positions and moving them through a bank account? Is there a better way to do this that hasn‚Äôt occurred to me?

Plus the following:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* As of June 2024, Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loans, 42% more than they owed a decade earlier.  SoFi has approximately 60% of the private student loan refinancing market.
* SoFi has reached 1 year of full profitability after Q3 2024.
* Institutional ownership is the highest it has ever been at 45.6% (Probably even higher when the new number comes out)
* SoFi wants to get loans from high-quality borrowers with high FICO scores. They were rejecting about 80% of the applicants.  They can easily raise that risk and jump their business as long as it stays within the default margin for profitability.   Their large increase in customers every quarter allows them to get low-cost funding for lending out money given their bank charter status, unlike many other Fintechs that don't have a bank charter.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing¬†SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely abandon the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price jumps.

Almost all of them come to the conclusion that the future of SoFi looks solid and are expecting consistent growth especially after recent earnings and guidance for the upcoming years. 

IMO - If you think about it, there are so many reasons why SoFi is a company that could continue to thrive in the future even after the massive 50% increase in october.

Besides reasons like ‚Äúanalyst manipulation‚Äù or ‚Äúbig bank manipulation‚Äù that I have heard from a few folks, are there any further reasons I'm missing that lead to these bad analyst forecasts?

CEO: ""This is why you often hear me say, it's a matter of when, but not if we'll become a Top 10 institution""

* I could not be prouder of how we've scaled this segment over the past five years since launching these products through a tumultuous and unpredictable environment to now be a $1 billion annualized revenue business growing over 100% with strong and improving profitability. And frankly, it's still day one.
* We continue to see a strong pipeline of potential partners that are striving to modernize their platforms.
* Our one-stop shop continues to attract great cross-buying behavior by our members. In fact, 32% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members and 20% of our new members opened a second product in their first 30 days. This is the power of the flywheel we have developed.
* Overall, we're making incredible progress in our shift towards more fee-based, capital-light and lower-risk revenue sources. Combined, fee-based revenue made up $174 million or a quarter of our adjusted net revenue in Q3. This revenue grew by 65% year-over-year. On an annualized basis, that's nearly $700 million in revenue.

* In credit cards, we officially launched the everyday cash rewards and the essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people spending and borrowing needs,
* We shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue.
* We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years.
* Home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022.
* In our tech platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks in Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyber Bancorp for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsored bank program.
* We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galileo instant verification engine, which we call GIVE as well as transaction risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency. Our new secured credit with dynamic funding offering promotes greater financial inclusion and enables clients to help their customers build stronger credit.
* We launched programs with clients signed in prior quarters, spanning cross-border payments, global payouts, financial literacy, and scalable payment solutions.
* Delinquencies peaked in March of 2024. Since then, we've continued to see improvements quarter-over-quarter.
* In closing, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished not just for Q3, but for delivering a steady and consistent record of durable growth, incredible brand building and product innovation that help our members and clients and strong improving returns for our shareholders. The future is bright, and I am fired up for what in store.
* We reduced our brokered deposits by $445 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher cost parts of the funding stack.
* SoFi Money continues to resonate well, maintaining market share and ranking in API. We saw over $2 billion in member deposit growth in the quarter, with spending levels on par or better than historical levels. Direct deposit customers are more engaged, with higher product adoption, contributing to our competitive advantage.
* We declined between 70% and 80% of the personal loan applicants to SoFi. And so there's a lot of potential
* His closing statement: We now face hopefully, the most advantageous environment that we've seen since I joined the company, and we began the relentless march to be a one-stop shop. Today, we are no longer just a lending company. Today, we are a force to be reckoned with. It is truly our time as we have more products, more members, more capital and more diverse revenue streams than ever before. We are undeniably the absolute best patient company to capture the massive opportunities still ahead of us because of the same thing that got us here, our people. Our people are great at heart. Thank you, everyone, for your time today, and we hope you have a great end to 2024.

CFO:

* Loan Platform Deals: CFO: This is a fee-based and capital-light revenue source for us. We generate cash fees upfront at the time of transfer or referral without taking balance sheet risk.¬†Importantly, there are no financing commitments or loss share agreements associated with these deals.
* There is a 220 basis points difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base.
* We expect modest growth in balance sheet originations year-over-year. We are happy with the current size of our balance sheet and the net interest income generated. Excess demand from borrowers and loan investors is being fulfilled through our loan platform business. We expect growth in student loan refinancing and home loans in a lower rate environment.
* Recent (loan) vintages are projected to produce higher returns, with ROEs above 30%. This is driven by lower expected life of loan loss rates, higher pricing beta, funding cost efficiencies, and origination fees.
* We expect continued strong growth in the loan platform business, with commitments from Fortress and other partners. Demand is strong, and we are fulfilling it through the loan platform business.
* For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels.
* Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and tech platform will grow low to upper teens percent year-over-year.
* GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share.

Looking at SOFI they have increased income year over year, and it looks like they may become profitable these earnings. 

  
They have some of the best APY for holding money in their account. Seeing as other banks($JPM) want to start charging for accounts this could be something that sets them apart. Alot of the younger generation are looking to be more financially smart and put money somewhere that makes them money. 

  
Looking at their stock, they look undervalued and look like they will start making a profit this earnings report if not next. 

  
Looking at the next two weeks an in the money call looks strong with a lowish IV at 32% for 7/19 and 42 for 7/26. This week will be filled with many chances of black swan events so the IV could dramatically increase. 

  
Saying this I really like the call prices for 7.5c but if you are not as regarded and want to be risk adverse stocks look super strong.

The company has been punished by shorts since its IPO with a nearly 19% short float. I believe that Noto will punish the shorts and we'll see a large move in SOFI incoming with CPI numbers coming in cool again.

1bk2e8q_SOFI,SOFI,"Is SOFI oversold, discussion also on what's going on as it is one of my investments and I'd like an outside opinion","So, about mid feb-march sofi announced its first quarterly profit, resulting in the stock price shooting up to 9 dollars from the 7-8 range. Not long after that, however, the company announced a capital raise of 600$ million that would potentially be financed by the sale of shares in 2029. However, at current prices after the huge drop the valuation is still over 6$ billion so this still would be less than 10% of the companys valuation. (Note the stock is also currently trading at under 7$ at time of posting). Here's the part on my thesis:  
  
Although the company is now profitable, and will probably continue to be, the board was aware that the announcement of raising this capital had the potential to drop the price a lot. They knew this, and instead of doing the proper thing of explaining what the capital raising was for, decided to publish no info on that and profit off of the share price dropping so massively as a result of no real announcement about what this huge amount of funding was for. They also have made no efforts to reassure investors about why this is good for the company (which is very easy for them to do even if they just said the money was for a big expansion and didn't specify what to keep their plans safe). They probably sold a lot of shares prior to this announcement or profited off the information some other way by letting others sell before hand. It has been a few weeks now since this announcement and there has been complete silence from the board. Also, since a lot of banks and finance companies are starting to notice SOFI as a competitor the stock is probably very oversold as well since these competitors also will publish bad news and give poorer ratings to the stock (a lot of the older banks and such have their own stock analysts, etc that would be able to do this).  
  
In short, I think the stock is currently very oversold, the management are allowing this to happen for some reason, but at some point in the near future, possibly next earnings if it is also profitable, this will have to end. So, the shorts will probably be squeezed out before the next quarter report unless the management have found a way to make it slightly unprofitable through some one off investments/expenditures or accounting that shifts the profit to the quarter after that. Still, I'd rate this stock as a very good long term gamble at current prices that are somehow lower than the price before the company became profitable last quarter.

I truly resonate with the wise words of Kevin O‚ÄôLeary who stated it‚Äôs simply not a good choice to buy into something that dose not pay out  a form of interest for your investments (this being dividends).

In the case of SoFi‚Ä¶ and long term investing, based on the years I would hold the shares‚Ä¶. I feel like it would dumb not to acquire a stake while it‚Äôs where it is now instead of regretting it later.

How do you all feel about a long term 20+ year investment into a company that  pays out %0.00 dividen yield, but it‚Äôs trading under $10 bucks a share with the potential to flourish in my lifetime.",2023-12-14,0,10

Higher loan balances and net interest margin expansion drove strong growth in net interest income, which significantly exceeded directly attributable expenses of $138.5 million.

**Financial Services Segment Results:**

"" Financial Services segment record net revenue increased 142% in the third quarter of 2023 to $118.2 million from the prior year period's total of $49.0 million, helped by 43% growth in segment interchange revenue and 231% growth in net interest income. Notably, the company exceeded $1.2 billion in point of sale debit transaction volume in the quarter, representing an annualized $5 billion run-rate. Strength in the segment results was driven by SoFi Money along with contributions from SoFi Invest and SoFi Credit Card.

As the company moves toward ***expected GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter***, management expects depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expenses to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percentage range in the fourth quarter relative to third quarter results.""

**Noto's Statements:**

""Noto continued: ‚ÄúOur ***record number of member and product additions, along with improving operating efficiency, reflects the benefits of our broad product suite and unique Financial Services Productivity Loop (FSPL) strategy***\*\*.\*\*""

For new direct deposit accounts opened in the third quarter, the ***median FICO score was 743. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30***, and this has had a significant impact on ***debit spending, which exceeded $1 billion in quarterly debit transaction volume and was up 3.2x year-over-year, representing more than $5 billion of annualized debit transaction volume. We continue to see strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch in the first quarter of 2023 of enhanced FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter-end.***""

**SoFi's ranking:**

***SoFi was ranked 90 in large commercial banks as of June 30th, 2023***. This continued increase in assets and taking chunks out of the bigger banks is propelling SoFi up the rank at a quick swift pace and SoFi's ranking is going to be up another notch with this quarter's results. Making Noto's goal of becoming the top 10 banks closer and closer to reality.

16j2j8f_SOFI,SOFI,Thoughts on SOFI agressive automated investment account for divs,"So I was checking out the automated investment accounts and the agressive one peaked my interest, especially for dividends and growth. It invests your money into 5 different etfs: 

-58% SFY @ 1.43 yield - 0% expense ratio

-24% VEA @ 2.62 yield - 0.05% expense ratio

-8% VWO @ 3.48 yield - 0.08% expense ratio

-7% SFYX @ 2.62% yield - 0% expense ratio

-3% VB @ 1.61% yield - 0.05% expense ratio

I know a lot of people are pretty against auto accounts but honestly I think this could become a great set it and forget account and dollar cost averaging farm with the added benefits of decent div yield & growth. 

I‚Äôm 23 and still early in my investing career but I really like this automated account compared to a chase one I got when I first started getting interested in investing that invested in a variety of stocks, bond and etfs I had never heard of and have closed since then. 

I have now pivoted more into growth rather than dividends since I‚Äôm so young but after noticing these decent div yields, I though I‚Äôde share in this subreddit :) 

Idk, I‚Äôde love to hear what you folks think of this. 

Thanks!",2023-09-15,8,2

Been having issues with webull and dividend payments lately and their customer support is non-existent. They pay out dividend at random dates after the ex-div-date and sometimes it just disappears from receivables and casually apears in my account a few days later. Can be a little frustrating. It also sometimes takes days before appearing on receivables after ex-div-date and is always payed out late. I've heard good things from SoFi but still deciding whether I want to move my account there or not. I'm mostly looking for a good app since I prefer running everything from my phone.

Even before the bank turmoil hit, Young said she had anticipated some form of stress to show up in the economy, given the amount of liquidity that the had Fed drained and the increase in borrowing costs. The ensuing bank failures marked a symptom of the Fed's policy choices.¬†

""I think we're in a situation right now where we plugged the hole that was discovered sufficiently for the near-term, in the sense that depositors were covered,"" Young said, adding that the contagion appears to have been contained.

108w32j_SOFI,SOFI,1000 investors' were surveyed in the SoFi Investors Study and their plan on how they invest in 2023.,"93% of respondents continue to invest in 2022 despite the high market volatility.

85% of investors wanted to make changes to how they invest in 2023 with the following being the most commonly reported:

1. Increasing investments (21%)
2. Conducting more research (19%)
3. Working with a financial advisor (14%)

Other significant statistics from the article:

* 3/4 of investors regret how they invested in 2022
* 39% want to invest more (mostly Gen Z), 33% want to leave their investment alone, and 28% want to invest less during the high inflation in 2022.
* 33% cancel or delay plans or purchases because of money lost on 2022 investments.

Other key findings are nearly 90% of investors have non-stock market-related assets due to stock market volatility; men continue to out-invest women; and more impulsive portfolio changes especially with Gen Z during the 2022 high market volatility.

The most common regrets for investors in 2022 were not buying more crypto at lower prices, not buying more stock when the market started to decline, and not selling stock before the market started to decline.

yehduf_SOFI,SOFI,"I think I have a replacement for FAANG and it is STARS (Sofi, Tesla, Alphabet, Roblox, Salesforce)","FAANG (Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, Netflix and Google) may be good if you were in 2012 but you are not. I will say I am a believer in the Metaverse, but I do not think it is going to take over the globe like a lot of other people who are younger think. So just to clarify, will the Metaverse be profitable? Yes. Will it be as profitable as Mark Zuckerberg wants it to be? No. 

Here is a breakdown of why I think each company in STARS will be winners over the next decade: 

Sofi: Millennials like me do not like banks. We like using online only platforms. I have not been inside a bank in, tbh, probably a decade. This is not even touching on the fact that most large banks, whom do not even need to be mentioned by name, were involved in the 2008-2009 sub prime mortgage crisis. Why would anyone with a brain use these shitty companies? 

Tesla: Think Tesla is just vehicles? Think again. I see Tesla continuing to dominate the EV market over the next decade and beyond but also see them helping to invent some outstanding products that are not vehicle related at all. 

Alphabet: Today (10/26/2022) was a bad day for Alphabet (missed earnings). Don't let this fool you. Once the recession is over (I know I am just another internet stranger but I would say the recession is over in mid 2024) Alphabet will begin to soar and will as always be in almost every crevice of our lives like it has been the past 2 decades. 

Roblox: I think of all 5 stocks listed in STARS this one is the most undervalued at the moment. If you believe even a little in the Metaverse then Roblox should be your pick, in my opinion over Meta in fact. 

Salesforce: Tbh I think Salesforce when looking at everything (P/E ratio, earnings, etc) is a little overvalued. Long term this stock is a winner. This company does excellent work, I use them for my workplace all the time and no complaints. 

I was going to type a very long detailed explanation and include every single detail and every single thing possible for each. However this is r/stocks not a board of directors meeting so I trimmed it way down to just give my general thoughts. Take the advice above and tweak it. Let me know if STARS is a good investment or if it should be altered somehow.",2022-10-27,0,30

I bought 100 $10c expiring Sept 2. Premium $0.04. I believe risk is asymmetric. Market appears to be pricing that student loans will be paused again. Which means I would lose at most $400 USD. If it is not, or if just $10,000 USD are forgiven. That will create a large number of high net worth individuals wanting to refinance at a lower rate. Being said bet.

If he is going to forgive student loans the announcement has to be prior to the August 31st resume date so I can exit my position at not a complete loss.

uybz7a_SOFI,SOFI,Tell me why SOFI is a great stock," I personally do not live in the US so have no chance to try out the app myself. Back then I bought some shares of this company because of the interesting growth story and the hype(was naive). I know there are many Sofi bulls out here, but mine was just a starter position.  

The recent market downturn forces me to relook at my investments, and Sofi is one stock that I hesitate to buy more even at these prices. The more I study it, the more it looks like a bank, which means what they're doing can easily be replicated if legacy banks decide to invest in it. They seems to burn a lot of cash just to get people on board, and loans get approved much more easily which isn't necessarily a good thing imo especially in times like these. 

So what exactly is the value proposition here? Is there anything so special about it over legacy banks that will make you want to use it besides all the freebies they give to hook you in? And do consumers really feel that their money is safe with them? Yes they have a lot of products, but any banks can create these products too. Moreover, traditional banks have much solid balance sheet which to me is still a much safer option.

Please enlighten me as I really wanna understand the company. And perhaps share with me their path to profitability too if you can project it. 

Thanks a bunchüôå


EDIT: wow never expect so many replies thanks guys!! Seems like there are more bears than bulls here but both have valid points. After some thinking I will probably not buy more yet until they prove their unit economics to be profitable. Of course by then I won't be able to buy at the bottom but the risk reward as a minority shareholder will only become more favourable by then.

uvaeew_SOFI,SOFI,Why I‚Äôm still bullish on $SOFI,"Yes - the macro is terrible. Yes - student loan payments being suspended means their revenues face headwinds. Yes - rising interest rates.

But - have you actually used their app? It is one of the cleanest UIs I‚Äôve seen next to Robinhood (boooooooo). Once you get in to their app, the focus on cross-sell is nothing short of impressive.

Only wanted SoFi for their stocks? Too bad, you‚Äôre going to be incentivized with points to open a checking account. You thought that was it? Open credit card and get even more points. All points are redeemable for cash. They have one of the lowest cost of acquisitions in the industry and I can see why. The app is built absolutely beautifully.

I encourage you - give their app a shot. It just flat out works. I‚Äôm planning on refinancing a loan with them here soon. Because? Their stupid app and I get money back.

u023yv_SOFI,SOFI,SoFi company analysis and valuation - Big story and many risks ($SOFI),"SoFi has been a very popular retail stock and I underestimated the amount of information that was available for it. It took me quite some time to differentiate what is important and what isn't and this post is a summary of my findings and it includes valuation at the very end.

As always, the video is available for those who prefer to watch: [https://youtu.be/YkeEydywiiQ](https://youtu.be/YkeEydywiiQ)

**What is SoFi?**

SoFi is a Fintech company that aspires to be a one-stop-shop for financial services, that allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money.

Now, the main question is, well, **how is this different than a bank?** The management provides 4 differentiation points:

1. Speed - being faster than the competitors when it comes to approval of loans, opening accounts, buying/selling stock through their platform, payments, etc. - In my opinion, although this industry has been around for hundreds of years, there's no doubt that certain parts of it have to be disrupted. However, my question is, assuming this is an advantage that SoFi has, is it sustainable for the next 5, 10, or 15 years? I don't think so.

2. Selection of products - More products related to borrowing, saving, investing, and protecting money. I personally don't buy this differentiation point. I do believe cost-cutting is possible, but coming up with something new and innovative that's significantly different than the current offerings, I doubt it.

3. Content - Financial education, research, insights - Even if SoFi has a platform that offers more financial education and research, this is something that is easily replicable. I don't see this as a huge long-term advantage.

4. Convenience - Instead of having opening times between 9 and 5 from Monday to Friday, they want to offer the services 24/7. The company has an only online presence so they can cut some costs as they don't have to lease buildings for this purpose.

&#x200B;

**The 3 segments**

The company has 3 segments and it is worth spending time understanding each one:

1. The lending segment - self-explanatory - accounts for 75% of the total revenue
2. The technology segment - which is related to Galileo - accounts for 19% of the total revenue
3. The financial services segment - is related to all the products such as debit/credit cards, budgeting tools, investing, etc. - accounts for 6% of the total revenue

All 3 sectors have been growing fast, but we need more information to understand the second one.

The technology segment is related to an acquisition the company made back in 2020 (Galileo) and the purchase price was roughly $1.2b. At the time, that was almost 15% of the company's market cap. What SoFi got from the acquisition was a payment processing platform that uses AI for fraud detection, which is more efficient than the industry average. On top of that, it has an API that allows for app development. The revenue for SoFi will come in the form of platform fees and program management fees. This is one of their big bets and the management refers to this segment as the AWS of Fintech. The same way a business can be started on Amazon within a day, well, that's what they're aiming for, except for companies in the financial industry.

&#x200B;

**The growth story, the metrics, and the confusion**

The company provides two key metrics for its growth in its annual report.

1. The # of users - This has significantly grown from 1m back in 2019, to almost 2m in 2020 to almost 3.5m in 2021. However, it is worth mentioning that every one that is registered on the platform is a member and remains one unless the terms of service are violated. So, if there's an inactive member for 3 years, it doesn't matter, that person will be considered a member. However, what I'm missing here is the revenue per user. Having users is good, but if they're not being monetized, the metric is useless.
2. The # of products - If the first metric is not that useful, maybe this one serves a better job. If you as a member have a personal loan, well, that's one product. If you have a credit card, that's another one. If you are using their platform to invest, that's another one. The idea of the company to build a good relationship with its members and sell many of its products is great. Well, the number of products reported in 2021 was 5m. That translates to roughly 1.5 products per person. It did increase from 1.21 in 2019, but it isn't that impressive (yet). Although it sounds as if this could be a great metric, well, there's another trap here, not every product has the same value. 1m of these 5m products are related to the lending segment, which as mentioned above, accounts for 75% of the total revenue! The remaining 4m products bring in only 6% of the revenue as they're related to the financial services.

So, we have metrics that are not that reliable. What's next?

&#x200B;

**The company's performance and what can we expect?**

If we look at the company's performance, it is a money-losing company with a negative net margin of -48% for 2021 on its roughly $1b in revenue.

A **mature** company in this industry has:

\- a net margin that's between 10-15% 

\- high leverage (debt on the balance sheet being over 80% of the total passive)

\- RoE around 16%

Currently, the debt is around 50% of the balance sheet, so there's still a lot of room to grow.

These numbers should serve as a sanity check later on for my valuation as if I forecast anything that's significantly above that, it might be unreasonable.

&#x200B;

**What's next?**

The company made one large acquisition (Galileo) in 2020 for $1.2b. At the beginning of 2022, they announced the large acquisition of Technisys for $1.1b, which is a company that will serve as their core banking system. Both of these acquired companies have some presence in LATAM, so SoFi is acquiring new companies that have a presence in other geographical regions as well.

The analysts forecast about 50% revenue growth in 2022, followed by 41% revenue growth in 2023. Great growth, but slightly declining. At the same time, the net margin is expected to improve, from -48% in 2021, to :

\-21% in 2022

\-6% in 2023

\+5% in 2024

&#x200B;

**The risks**

Due to the actions being taken, there are two large risks that I see:

1. **Execution** risk - Their big bet (The technology segment), currently accounts for less than 20% of the revenue and hasn't yet proven as successful.
2. **Integration** risk - Combining SoFi with Galileo and Technisys might sound great and there's always the amazing word synergy being used, but that's yet to be seen in the financials. There's an integration risk here that needs to be addressed.

&#x200B;

**The valuation**

Taking into account all the information above, I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value.

**Revenue growth** \- 898% in the next 10 years (following analysts' estimates for the next 2 years, then slowly declining). From $1b in 2020 to $10b in 2030.

**Net margin** \- From -48% in 2021 to 13.5% in 2030 - Close to industry average

**Discount rate** \- 12.8% (Based on cost of equity)

**RoE** \- Based on the assumptions above and the development of equity, the RoE is roughly 15%, which is close to the industry's average.

&#x200B;

Putting all the numbers together, and adjusting for the equity options and the preferred shares, the value of the company is **$8.8b** (almost $8/share). The current market cap is $6.5b.

It is worth mentioning that at the moment, I am looking at SoFi as a company that's not significantly different than the current ones in this industry.  I am aware that I could be significantly wrong in my assumptions and if I see a better performance from their technology segment, my storyline would significantly change.

I'd like to get your view on the company and I am sure there are plenty of pieces in this puzzle that I have to learn more about.",2022-04-09,13,17

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF. ‚Äì January 18, 2022 ‚Äì SoFi Technologies, Inc. (‚ÄúSoFi‚Äù), the digital personal finance company, today announced that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve have approved its applications to become a Bank Holding Company through its proposed acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp, Inc., and operate its bank subsidiary as SoFi Bank, National Association. SoFi expects the acquisition to close in February, subject to completion or waiver of the remaining customary closing conditions.

‚ÄúThis incredible milestone elevates our ability to help even more people get their money right and realize their ambitions,‚Äù said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi. ‚ÄúWith a national bank charter, not only will we be able to lend at even more competitive interest rates and provide our members with high-yielding interest in checking and savings, it will also enhance our financial products and services to ensure they efficiently meet the needs of our members, business partners, and communities across the country, while continuing to uphold a high bar of regulatory standards and compliance. This important step allows us to add to our broad suite of financial products and services to better be there for our members during the major financial moments in their lives and all of the moments in between. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of our team and excited about the opportunities ahead to help even more people achieve financial independence.‚Äù 

Last year, in a key strategic step in SoFi‚Äôs path to obtaining a national bank charter, the company announced a definitive agreement by its subsidiary Social Finance, Inc. to acquire Golden Pacific Bancorp, Inc. (OTCPK: GPBI) and its wholly owned subsidiary Golden Pacific Bank, N.A. (together, ‚ÄúGPB‚Äù). SoFi plans to contribute $750 million in capital and pursue its national, digital business plan while maintaining GPB‚Äôs community bank business and footprint, including GPB‚Äôs current three physical branches. At the time of the announcement, SoFi submitted a revised business plan for GPB to the OCC and an application to become a bank holding company and for a change of control to the Federal Reserve for approval.

What are you thoughts? Which stock is the buy? 

Upstart who performed amazingly well in Q2? SoFi who posted a loss but has the broadest line of lending products, seemingly giving it the best overall potential for growth? OR LendingClub which appears to be a touch undervalued trading somewhere near 3.5-4.5% full year revenue as compared to roughly 16 and 12 respectfully.

Does LendingClubs acquisition earlier in the year give it the leg up it needs to be the Bull? 

Can Upstart who has insane valuation yet incredible performance thus far have the umph to stay at the top of the heap?

&#x200B;

* SOFI mentions soared today after the stock price provided solid returns to shareholders today, up 11% for the day.
* SDC momentum is carrying over from the last couple weeks. This seems to be the next ""short-squeeze"" stock you folks like.
* BB took off after-hours and was up 11% at one point, but is now up 6%.
* FB stock slid down 4%, which is unusual for a blue chip operated by none other than Mr Zuckerberg. As the WSB saying goes ""you cant cuck the zuck"" and so WSBers were buying the dip.
* LCID slid 7% down today, but that's okay because the stock went up 10% the day before.

Here's the data of ticker mentions throughout the day, visualized. We can see the exact moment BB took off after-hours and when SOFI reall started to pick up momentum.

prlvio_SOFI,SOFI,Thoughts on SoFi and their stock,I have very high hopes for SoFi as a company. Bank charter is coming very soon. Possibly in November. They have the SoFi Stadium that‚Äôs hosting multiple big sports events such as the the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games in 2028. Concerts coming from some big artists in the next few years. I‚Äôm sure that doing this will get their name out substantially! They are a one stop shop with possibly bigger plans in the future. Is thinking their stock will hit $100 in the next 5 years a stretch or am I not alone in believing this? Does anyone else have bullish theories on this company and their stock?

*---Promise or non-sense?---*

This is a digital finance company that offers you everything you need but not free real estate. The main feature of Sofi is that all of the financial management can be done on your mobile such as loans, investment and insurances, etc.  
Recently, they just IPOed through SPAC.   
Here are some of the recent highlights of the company. 

\-

# SoFi CEO Anthony Noto bought some stocks himself 

Anthony bought 7150 shares for two consecutive days on August 17 and 18.  
That‚Äôs 14300 shares in two days‚Ä¶ Noto owns in total over 2 million shares of SoFi. I‚Äôm just saying, not worth the hype at all. I don‚Äôt see any reason to feel bullish because of this. Realistically, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything AT ALL. 

\-

# Were Q2 earnings THAT bad?

It might seem to be bad, but they are actually EARNING! If you check the statements carefully, the losses were caused by a few large no-recurring expenses: value adjustment and stock compensation. These are all one-time spending.   
Their core is still profitable as the user base is showing rapid growth, which Q2 user counts grew 113% compared to last year. In addition, members are starting to use all other products on the app beside loans. 

\-

# Bad technical 

It‚Äôs currently below its 50MA, and a really ugly looking down trend which I think is kind of an overreaction. RSI is still dropping, meaning more people are selling it.  I usually do not stress on technicals, but this is actually so bad that I think it can't be ignored. 

\-

# Thoughts

The reason for this current bearish is temporary so as the technical and the lower-than-expected earnings report. I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend day trade or swing trade on SOFI. However, it‚Äôs a great stock if you‚Äôre value investing. üì∑

What do you guys think? Is this a stock worth buying? I‚Äôd like to know your thoughts on this.

Here‚Äôs Why:

1. Members growth 110% YOY (now at 2.3M). SOFI rolled out a ton of credit card promotions and new account bonuses. If just 10% of wsb users sign up for the free money alone, that‚Äôs a 43% increase in their membership base, which would blow their quarterly metrics and analyst expectations out of the water.
2. App store Top #4 app: SoFi app was #122 May, #102 in June, #5 yesterday, and now #4.
3. Their Galileo platform services 70 million accounts (130% YOY growth) and is used by many major Fintech companies (Samsung, MoneyLion, Monzo, SoFi, Vala, Wise etc). Galileo is used by RobinHood and nearly all their transactions are processed through it.
4. So, if RobinHood does well, then SOFI should do equally well. HOOD is valued at 45 Billion, while SOFI is way undervalued at 13 Billion. With higher annual revenue and growth, SOFI should be near 25 Billion in my opinion; once people learn more about the company.
5. A friend of a friend who knows a friend that works at the company who‚Äôs also my friend, says they are actively working on options trading platform.
6. Bank charter status:  this is jet fuel to SOFI‚Äôs business allowing them to out compete and out tech anyone.  Expected by end of year or early next. Just a matter of time.
7. Cathie Wood will likely add SOFI to ARKK or ARKF in the near future. We know how much she loves SQ. SOFI should fit her funds perfectly; both high tech and high growth.  SoftBank is already a major investor in SOFI.
8. Stock took a beating past couple months due to lock up expiration. By now, those who wanted to sell already sold. Only way is up.

I will make sure to only summarize and include some parts of those DD's that were not meant for pump & dump. This is a NON BIASED SOFI DD & Analysis. Let's get started -**

&#x200B;

***What is SOFI?***

**Social Finance, Inc aka SoFi** is an American online personal finance company. A mobile-first service based in San Francisco, SoFi provides a suite of financial products that includes student loan refinancing, checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, stock investing and banking through both their mobile app and desktop interfaces. It is an ALL in one app for all your financial and investing needs.

Look at the products sofi has to offer. The company has an amazing easy to use user interface and very smooth app.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# What separates SOFI from other competitors?

The one single factor that gains Sofi a lot of revenue and sales is **""Convenience"".** Because they provide a lot of services, they are able to attract their customers to get different products.

Let's say you decide to buy a car and go to Sofi for a car loan. The Sofi team asks you to provide your Social security, pay stubs, previous bills, etc. and then finally grants you a car loan. Now, let's say after 3 months your friend who has been making a bank trading AMC and GME tells you to invest and you don't have a brokerage account. You eventually would end up knocking SOFI's door and ask them to let you invest because why the fuck would you want to fill out forms and apply at other brokerages. Now, let's say after couple of months of trading, you end up losing all your money because you're an APE who yolo'ed entire savings into 1st ever options play. Now, you need money for that business degree because you suck at investing. What would you do here? Would you go to some student loan company and fill out all the forms, provide credit history, etc. or would you just call up SOFI and ask them to loan you some tendies? The simple answer is **""Call up SOFI"" because it's convenient.**

&#x200B;

# SOFI also came up with IPO investing.

You can now invest in IPO's even before they're traded on an exchange. Cool, innit?Unlike Robinhood, SOFI would never restrict the sale of the securities to the members in secondary markets. However, if you invest in an IPO and sell within 30 days then you might be restricted from IPO purchase for next 30 days or so. More details can be found on their website -

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# History of SOFI & how did it become such a big company

SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested about $2 million in approximately 100 students, for an average of $20,000 per student.

The founders were soon able to raise $1billion from softbank few years ago. The company is very successful and trading way below their valuation price.

&#x200B;

# Let's have a look at the SOFI's chart this year

This is 1 year chart for Sofi, it has a very very strong support at 15$. The stock has gone below 15$ only twice in 2021 and then rallied the following 2 weeks. The movement of this stock is like a spring, a huge dip is followed by an insane highs. The earnings are due 8/12 and I strongly believe that this stock will run before the earnings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Price Targets

Michael Miller, an equity analyst at morning star said that $20.50 is a Fair Value for this stock. It's currently trading at $15.10 at the time of writing this DD. That's an upside of 25%.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Summary of why is SOFI a good play?***

&#x200B;

* A very strong support at 15$ price, in the last 7-8 months, this stock has rallied after a huge dip. With the earnings coming up for this company, I am positive that there will be a rally.

&#x200B;

* Sofi is positioned to be a #1 leader in the fintech sector. They are jacks of all trades and offering different products to their customers all within one app or website.

&#x200B;

* Convenience of being able to apply for student loans, investing, mortgages will attract consumers because who wants to end up applying at different companies for different needs.

&#x200B;

* Sofi acquired GALILEO which is a very big company. You haven't heard of this company yet because it's a B2B company. Sofi paid about 1.2B$ for it. They're basically a payment processing platform like stripe, square, paypal etc which is used by all top fintech companies around the globe.

&#x200B;

* The main goal of SOFI is to be able to provide as many products and services they can to their consumers. They are soon going to be a OneStopShop. Their goal is to basically become an amazon of FinTech and provide all the services in one place. By acting as a one-stop shop for its customer‚Äôs finances, SoFi intends to create powerful cross-selling advantages that will reduce its cost of acquisition and give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

&#x200B;

* SOFI has acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp and applying to become a national bank in the US.

&#x200B;

* The company saw its client growth accelerate in 2020, with more than 2.2 million members on its platform by the end of the first quarter of 2021.

&#x200B;

* The company‚Äôs expanded product lineup along with increased adoption of digital banking during the pandemic has helped accelerate SoFi‚Äôs growth, with the number of members increasing by nearly 80-90% in 2020. Rapid growth has continued into 2021, and SoFi remains the only company utilizing a digital full-service model, giving it a clear product niche. Source - morningstar

&#x200B;

* It is projected that SOFI would get an approval to become a bank in late 2021 or early 2022.

&#x200B;

* It is projected that revenue will increase at a 43% CAGR over the next five years as the company benefits from its unique product offering as well as the revenue contributed by its 2020 acquisition of Galileo, which is only the one section of SOFI.

&#x200B;

* During the company‚Äôs SPAC merger, the company issued equity to PIPE investors to raise more than $1.2 billion in capital, on top of the $800 million that was generated by the SPAC merger itself. This along with debt paydown that occurred both immediately prior and during the SPAC merger has left the company in a good financial position.

&#x200B;

* SoFi has more than $2 billion in cash and over $4 billion in debt, but that entire debt money is used to finance its lending activities. I believe that there is only little financial risk for SoFi, and incase company decides to re strategize their investment decisions then they would have plenty of money to do so.

&#x200B;

* The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YOY respectively and the total products used by members has grown by 121% YOY and financial products has grown 273% YOY.

oivgw4_SOFI,SOFI,"Avoid FOMO - Here are tickers on my radar that have meme'd before, but are currently beaten-up: SOFI, RKT, CRSR","We all know buying into the FOMO on stocks that are super hot can be extremely risky. 100% gains are enticing and the result in anxiety from trades that ‚Äúcould have been‚Äù can hurt. However, losing 40% on a FOMO trade hurts MUCH WORSE. Remember, the goal is protect your capital at all costs, a 50% decline in portfolio requires 100% gain to make up for it.

When I look for these setups I always ask myself ‚ÄúHow much do I stand to lose? How much do I stand to gain?‚Äù. If my reward outweighs my risk then I‚Äôll open a position.

&#x200B;

I want to talk a little about FOMO and actually more on avoiding it. Here‚Äôs the monthly chart for NEGG that squeezed HARD last week going up almost 400% in 7 trading days. The idea is to emphasize the high-risk red zones on the chart and look for setups that are in the green and orange zones. Of course, hindsight is 20/20 and it‚Äôs more difficult to find these setups looking into the future, but investing is all about managing risk and protecting capital while not over-leveraging yourself with options or margin. Here‚Äôs the NEGG chart and I‚Äôll break it down below.

https://preview.redd.it/0cv0k5tqbta71.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0fc960e33a3e122c8ec0497dc024f5b8d363731

The green zone is essentially where you want to have bought in -people who own it here are not expecting a 400% move, rather they own it because they like the stock. The orange zone is where traders picked up on the social media hype early and start to get in. By the time it‚Äôs in the red zone and social media hype has taken over it becomes a lotto play. Sure in this zone the ticker could go up another 50%, it could also go down 75%. The red zone doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean I think the stock is a sell (if you owned from a green or orange zone), but entering a new position is incredibly risky. Remember, this isn‚Äôt a stock picking service, but what we are looking for are potential setups.

&#x200B;

Here‚Äôs another example from WISH that has been trending over the last several weeks.

https://preview.redd.it/c05jkm5sbta71.png?width=2374&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc7f9ced263c9207da1f861312d8d252b1680838

WISH has been in a slow bleed since February, looking back you might think that any period between April and May could have been a buying opportunity, which is true. However, the base really did end up forming early June at around $8-9.

At the June lows the risk was what, another $2 and a drop in stock price to $6-7? At some point in time there would be value dip buyers coming in. Before you go on and say WISH is a garbage company I want you to remember they are currently doing approximately 2.9 billion in annual sales and their market cap is only 7.25 billion giving them a price to sales ratio of only 2.5x.

&#x200B;

How does that compare to a company like SNOW? SNOW obviously has higher margins than the e-commerce company, but SNOW trades at a price-to-sales of 110x, their market cap = 80 BILLION, revenues = 700 MILLION. What makes them different? Mainly their expected growth and gross margin, but also the perceived value, SNOW was once $450 per share, surely it‚Äôs current price of $269 (nice) is somewhat cheap ;)

Let‚Äôs move along to this week‚Äôs setups that I am looking at (these are in no particular order or preference).

&#x200B;

**#1: SoFi (SOFI)**

https://preview.redd.it/tmbp6t6vbta71.png?width=2580&format=png&auto=webp&s=5086a8c1a53e36e43cc1d067c42666c9c21bc6dd

SOFI was trending on WallStreetBets and Twitter last week. When I look at social trends, this is usually the kind I like to see -when bullish social sentiment picks up after a stock price dips. Preferably I try to avoid stocks that received a lot of hype build-up after the stock goes up 100% in 2 days (refer to NEGG above for the example).

SoFi is a FinTech company that is gaining popularity with the millennial generation. The stock is down 40% from the recent high over the last 2 months and could find some support at the blue line ($15 area). This has been on my list for long-term holds for a while (they did a SPAC merger with ticker IPOE). The company currently does $560 million revenues TTM and has a market cap of $13 billion, trading at roughly 24x price-to-sales.

&#x200B;

**#2: Rocket Companies (RKT)**

https://preview.redd.it/pi3sp3ywbta71.png?width=2590&format=png&auto=webp&s=4473089aed44e4293925fbd08e9c0321c6965d94

The year is 2069, RKT is still trading at $20, or is it? RKT has always been one of social media‚Äôs popular stocks. We can see back in March it squeezed HARD, and yet here it is trading at the same levels. Here‚Äôs why I like Rocket Companies:

They are doing 19 billion revenues TTM (trailing twelve months) and only valued at 38 billion. They are trading at less than 2x price-to-sales and a PE of only 7.5 (crazy low valuation).

The risks include a slow in the growth of mortgages and the idea that the mortgage ‚Äúboom‚Äù they saw was not sustainable. However, they are proving to become a more recognizable brand nationwide (domestic U.S).

&#x200B;

In my opinion, the downside is limited (it can only drop so far before it becomes incredible value). Upside is potentially another squeeze back into the $40‚Äôs.

From a risk-to-reward point of view I like this ticker. One issue, which is visible from the chart, is the fact that it may just stay at $20 for eternity. Only time will tell.

&#x200B;

**#3: Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

https://preview.redd.it/prohnapybta71.png?width=2584&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffaab6f7cad6dd063effd3f1629335ab8330f58b

This is another ‚Äúretail‚Äù favorite that seems to get picked up a lot on social sentiment. As you can see, the last 8 months have been rather disappointing for the stock. It hit over $50 per share around ThanksGiving time last November and has been stagnant since. CRSR is doing almost 2 billion in revenues and valued at only 3 billion market cap, trading at P/S of only 1.5x.

&#x200B;

**Closing Thoughts**

That‚Äôs all for today‚Äôs letter. As you can see, I like to focus on tickers that have the POTENTIAL to gain momentum with the social sentiment crew, but are currently in a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù period or have been beat up so much that retail loses interest in them. In my opinion a good entry point could be when a quality stock has been beaten-down, not after they‚Äôve shot up 50% day after day.",2021-07-12,48,19
ogdlsw_SOFI,SOFI,"Calling SoFi bulls, can you tell me why SoFi isn't just a regular bank dressed up for millennials?","Been reading SoFi DD's on here and WSB and, unless i'm missing something, SoFi just seems like a run-of-the-mill bank targeted for people 20-35. I personally use SoFi because at the time they had the best APR and access to all ATM for free (they don't have this policy anymore).

I don't know much about their home, college and auto loan business but i cant imagine people taking out a loan with SoFi just because they have a checking account. When i take out a loan, I'm looking at the rates first and everything else second. Convenience is nice but I'd suck it up if Chase is offering me a used car loan for 4% vs some other bank for 8%.

There are people that say Galileo is the key to SoFi, and this justifies people lumping SoFi into the fin-tech industry. But investing in SoFi because of Galileo is another issue all together, and right now, Galileo is about 1/8 of SoFi's business.

I should also say that I haven't dug deep into SoFi, but everything i've looked at so far has told me it's a bank trading like a tech company.",2021-07-08,60,48

Cramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). 


And with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future.

All the deals are similar. SoFi is buying
capabilities from small players it can roll into a
full-service bank-and-brokerage offering for a
national audience, running off a mobile app.
SoFi is the ultimate expression of this
change and, in Anthony Noto, it has a leader

banker who helped take Twitter public and

A specific example I am looking into is to sell SOFI $15 puts for January 21, 2022. The put is currently trading at about $2.80. I would make immediately $280 on the sell, with only having the risk of paying $1500 for 100 shares of SOFI, if the stock price is below $15 on January 21.

Basically that means I would only have an actual loss if the stock price is below $12.20. This seems very low risk to me, while still giving a very good return of 18,6% on a 6-month period, should the option expire worthless. Also, should the stock price go lower, I wouldn‚Äôt mind holding this one for the longer term as I believe in their fundamental business. Is there anything I‚Äôm missing?

SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi#:~:text=SoFi%20was%20founded%20in%202011,debt%20to%20fund%20their%20education.

I am just a big believer in bringing personal finances to the masses and to teach people about personal finance and how to accumulate and build wealth, most parents and schools don‚Äôt teach shit on the subject matter. I absolutely love SoFi's statements/mantras:

- Our number one goal is helping our members get their money right. 

- SoFi's mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions.

Let's go over some #s.  SoFi has been around and growing as a private company for some time now and has seen seven consecutive quarters of YoY growth w Q1 2021 producing 110% growth and ending w 2.281M members.  This is exponential to say the very least.

I will be linking the data and numbers, but that is all readily available for all the see and find.  The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YoY respectively.  The biggest factors to me are they are scaling and accumulating data.  These 2 things are what are going to set companies apart to not only produce growth but obtain profitability to the bottom line. 

The goal of SoFi is to be the one-stop shop for everything a person would need for finance.  Checking/savings accounts, personal loans, home loans, student loans, car loans, budgeting, investing in the markets, and on and on.  The total products used by members has grown by 121% YoY and financial products has grown 273% YoY.  It appears to this layman that they are figuring out to how grow members as well as total products used by member.  https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sofis-q1-earnings-beat-managements-guidance-as-company-prepares-to-trade-on-nasdaq-2021-05

SoFi acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc in its quest to get a federal bank charter, which is cumbersome and tedious process.  This would be an upcoming catalyst for sure if/when this happens https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sofi-s-bank-buy-presents-blueprint-for-more-fintech-bank-deals-63129976

The Galileo acquisition was a game changer and covered well by u/havocs2 in his DD, I would just add that this has seen 130% YoY (everything seems to be growing triple digits) growth as well. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/ 

$SoFi was brought to market under the SPAC model and coverage of the stonk has just began.  Coverage was initiated by Oppenheimer w an outperform and was also initiated by Rosenblatt w a buy.  TipRanks has it rated as moderate buy and a price target of $27.50, about a 40% premium to today's closing price.  https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast

I am not a bot, nor am I a shill.  I am very active (to fucking active to be honest) in the daily and I post almost all my plays in real time.  Check my post history and you can see that I have been in this play for some time and believe in the company.

Current positions: 5 $12.50 2023 LEAPS, 2 $20.00 2023 LEAPS, and 155 shares and no intention of dumping or selling short term.

Is there a high SI? is the borrow rate high? Was this targeted because it was a Chamath SPAC?  Probably, i don't know for sure and honestly don't give 2 shits if it is or it is not, I like the company and the stonk and think it is undervalued and will only grow in the future.  That is what the hell I think.  

To be a FinTech disrupter, you obviously need an app and great user-friendly UI and SoFi has a 4.8 rating w over 48K reviews on the $AAPL app store.

TL;DR There is no industry/s that need more disruption than banks and brokerages.  For far too long the poors and working class have been hit w hidden fees, outrageous fees, shit even made-up accounts.  SoFi is the just the company to do this disrupting all in one beautiful app!

First off here's YOLO Proof: https://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp - the total gains reflected is not accurate as I rolled a lot of my July contracts to October for similar pricing.
Onto the DD:

-	GALILEO, the B2B Monster - This company you probably never heard of got acquired by Sofi last year. They are a payment processing platform that financial tech companies use to process payments, issue company branded debit cards. A similar company Marqeta $MQ which powers $SQ debit cards is valued at 15 Billion ALONE. Galileo is only one subdivision of the SOFI conglomerate, as of this writing $SOFI is valued 16.83 Billion. Over 90% of all digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 Fintech companies use Galileo, it speaks for itself. https://imgur.com/a/slEyUSe

-	The shorts and Goliath - This stock has been shorted with an insane borrow fee of 222.82%. Shortable stocks shows 'Zero Borrow', but still lists 45000 shares available. Fintel shows on 06/24 there are '0' SOFI short shares available. I don't see why this stock is so shorted, but it is a company that went public via Chamath Palihapitiya via IPOE. Just like CLOV and SPCE before this. - forewarning, a lockup period expires for  shareholders today. Trying to find exact number. Do research on exact number of shares being unlocked but something to be aware of. I believe a lot of people sold in anticipation of insiders selling, but I'm a firm believer in the company nonetheless.

-	SOFI is applying to become a national bank to get their cost of money down, and they have attempted to speed that process up by acquiring a small bank and infusing cash into it:
https://imgur.com/a/SEeFYKm
The one stop shop -
SOFI's goal is to become a one stop shop for consumers. Banking, lending, credit cards, trade stocks, provides insurance, everything. This is the one thing I have yet to see any FinTech attempt. Most FinTech's stick to a singular product but SOFI is seeking to service everyone's financial needs in one app. SOFI's revenue will only continue to grow as if a new member joins they'll likely use more than just the initial service they got on board with.

A lot of people went to Fidelity, a lot stayed, and a few went to SOFI, this is SOFI's short fall. They do not have margin yet and no options currently, but Anthony Noto, the CEO of SOFI announced that it's on their road map: https://imgur.com/a/apMyXXD

I believe they're aware of of the importance of adding options and margin and I'm hoping itll be soon as they're 100% getting my business after they do so. SOFI Hong Kong already has margin as well.

>SoFi filed paperwork Friday with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to launch the SoFi Weekly Dividend ETF (WKLY), a new stock-based exchange traded fund that will pay dividends every seven days.

>The ETF will be similar to SoFi Weekly Income ETF TGIF, a bond ETF that also pays out dividends every seven days.

>WKLY will use a passive management/indexing approach and track the performance of the SoFi Sustainable Dividend Index. In a fund summary filed with the SEC, the company wrote that the new ETF will aim to put at least 80% its net assets (plus any borrowing made for investment purposes) into dividend paying securities.

>The SoFi Sustainable Dividend Index includes companies that meet the following criteria:

>Liquidity: Companies must have a minimum average daily value traded of $5M over the previous one- and six-month periods, or $3.75M for companies already included in the index.

>Market Capitalization: Companies must have a minimum free-float market capitalization of $1B (or $750M for companies already included in the Index). Free float market capitalization measures a company‚Äôs market capitalization based on the number of outstanding shares for trading by the general public, rather than the total value of all of the company‚Äôs shares of stock.

>Dividend Growth: Companies must have paid regular dividends during the previous 12 months and be forecasted to pay regular dividends during the next 12 months. Companies must also have dividends per share over the previous 12 months that are higher or equal to 90% of the annual dividends per share paid out one year ago and five years ago.

>Payout Ratio: Companies must have a payout ratio between 0% and 100%. (Companies already in the index that fall outside of that range for two consecutive index reconstitutions with be removed.) The payout ratio is defined as dividends paid per share during the last 12 months divided by the latest reported earnings per share over the same period.

lbz13j_SOFI,SOFI,Disappointed with Robinhood and moving to another broker? Here's a recent DD I did on SoFi,"**If you are moving your brokerage account to SoFi then it is definitely worth considering an investment.**

**Note:** *Valuation figures are slightly off as the DD is a couple of weeks old.*

**TLDR: SoFi has a big opportunity to disrupt the US banking industry and be the category leader in consumer fintech. At the current price, they are undervalued relative to future projections.**

Hi,

A small bit late to the party but I wrote up some key takeaways from SoFi's recent announcement to go public via SPAC. ($IPOE)

The investor presentation and webinar that I mention throughout can be found here: [https://www.sofi.com/investors/](https://www.sofi.com/investors/)

Let me know if you find this post valuable :)

SoFi

SoFi is an online personal finance company that offers a suit of consumer financial products including personal loans, mortgages, investing and insurance.

SoFi is planning to go public in the first quarter of 2021 via a SPAC merger with Chamath Palihapitiya‚Äôs $IPOE SPAC. Palihapitiya has an impressive track record when it comes to SPACS, he recently helped both Virgin Galactic & Opendoor to go public via SPAC. In fact IPOE has already gone up by close to 100% since the SoFi merger announcement in early January.

He had this to say about SoFi:

\>\*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at a point where banking isn‚Äôt meeting the needs of US consumers‚Ä¶ people want low to no fees, fair and transparent lending & a full suite of products so you can have a one-stop shop‚Ä¶ SoFi was top of the list when I looked at all of the companies across those dimensions.‚Äù\*

In this post, I‚Äôll do a deep-dive on SoFi. I‚Äôll cover their market opportunity, product offerings, unique business model, growth/performance, future projections and more!

SoFi‚Äôs Opportunity

SoFi‚Äôs opportunity is simple yet staggering. They have the opportunity to disrupt the entire US banking industry. The slide below from a SoFi investor presentation illustrates just how big the opportunity is; SoFi‚Äôs goal is to dismantle companies such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America with a combined market cap of ***$2 trillion.*** (see investor webinar).

Another (slightly more useful) way to look at SoFi‚Äôs total addressable market is to look at the total number of bank accounts up for grabs in the US. Slide 8 from the investor presentation shows that there are over 500 million accounts, with 50% of US consumers having more than one bank account.

It‚Äôs difficult to put a monetary value on those 500 million accounts, but even a conservative estimate of their average value would put SoFi‚Äôs TAM (total addressable market) into the trillions of dollars. A massive opportunity.

Make no mistake, the US banking industry is ripe for disruption. They have legacy technology. They are hampered by regulation. Customer satisfaction is at an all time low with most banks having very restrictive lending practices while making most of their money through hidden/high fees. Palihapitiya outlines the state of US banking very well below:

\>\*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs interesting about financial services is that, since 2010, coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, we have seen what can probably be described as a stagnation in the product: these large financial institutions, through a combination of very strict regulation as well as extremely old legacy technology, has been very much handcuffed. In so doing, consumer dissatisfaction has continued to go up, NPS has continued to go down, and in some cases have gone negative. In many ways, what‚Äôs happened is that these companies have stopped giving consumers the value that they need.‚Äù\*

The next decade will bring massive changes in banking. There is a huge amount of money chasing this Fintech opportunity with over $500 billion dollars of venture capital money invested into fintech startups over the last decade. Let‚Äôs take a look at why SoFi is so well placed to be the category leader and take advantage of this huge opportunity.

SoFi‚Äôs strategy

SoFi highlights 4 differentiators as key to their business strategy; Speed (Fast), Selection, Content & Convenience. These are expanded upon in slide 5 of the investor presentation.

The core aspect of SoFi‚Äôs strategy is its ***member-centric approach***. We saw earlier how fragmented the US banking market is, with 50% of US consumers using more than one bank. In contrast, SoFi‚Äôs goal is to be a one-stop shop for its members, providing access to all of the financial services they need under one roof.

This multi-product membership strategy creates a powerful flywheel effect of product adoption for SoFi. They acquire a customer for one product who then goes on to adopt more and more products in the product suite. What‚Äôs so powerful about this is that each new product that that customer adopts essentially has a ***zero marginal cost of acquisition***. These customers are already in the SoFi ecosystem. This leads to very strong unit economics with low overall CAC (cost of customer acquisition) and high LTV (lifetime value). (see slide 6 of the investor presentation for more detail on this strategy)

There is strong evidence that this multi-product strategy is working for SoFi.

SoFi is on track to hit 3 million members by 2021 end, resulting in an impressive 75% yoy (year-over-year) membership growth. In the same time period, S***oFi expects their multi-product membership to almost double, growing 95% yoy.*** The fact that multi-product growth is exceeding total membership growth is a clear indication that the flywheel has started turning.

And SoFi has the results to prove it! 2 statistics really stand out:

1. 65% of SoFi‚Äôs home loans come from existing customers. This has driven $30 million in quarterly revenue on just $1 million in acquisition marketing. This is impressive. ***SoFi‚Äôs marketing expenditure for home loans is just 3.33% of revenue.***
2. SoFi looked at the scenario where a current account and a loan were held by 2 separate customers and compared it to the multi-product scenario whereby the products were held by one member. They found that the multi-product scenario ***increased variable profit per customer by $825 (180%)*** due to the zero cost of acquisition for the second product.

Customers also seem to be very satisfied with the SoFi approach. SoFi has a 4.8 star rating in the Apple app store with almost 60k ratings. They have a 4.4 star rating in the Google play store with almost 7K ratings.

Diversification & Data

In April 2020, SoFi made (what was in my opinion) a genius move - they acquired the banking infrastructure company Galileo for $1.2 billion.

Galileo is a platform which powers payments, debit cards, bank accounts and other financial services for many of the biggest companies in fintech such as TransferWise, Robinhood and Revolut.

Many of these companies are arguably SoFi‚Äôs competitors. In fact, through Galileo, SoFi is now responsible for 90% of all new ‚Äòneobank‚Äô accounts created in the US.

SoFi sees Galileo as an opportunity to become the AWS of fintech. They look to be heading in the right direction with Galileo seeing 131% yoy growth in Q3 of 2020. Slide 22 from the investor presentation goes into more detail on the benefits of the Galileo acquisition.

Galileo helps SoFi to accelerate its multi-product flywheel and expand SoFi products to Galileo partners while also being an amazing diversified line of revenue in its own right.

What I find most exciting about the Galileo acquisition is that it provides SoFi with the opportunity to build a very strong data moat around its business that their competitors will have difficulty recreating. From Chamath:

\>\*‚ÄúNow, you can see what is building here: millions of members at the top of the funnel consuming millions of products starts to create what we think is the real competitive moat to this business, because when you have these millions of people giving SoFi their personal, financial and behavioural data, what it allows SoFi to do is to build better risk models. Why that‚Äôs so important is that, then it allows them to better price risk; that‚Äôs how you lend money without losing money in fintech.‚Äù\*

Financials

SoFi‚Äôs revenue growth is accelerating and their projections through to 2025 are impressive. They expect to **grow revenue 6X with an average growth rate of 43% per year.** They also expect to be profitable (EBITDA) by next year and expect an **adjusted EBIDTA profit margin of 32% by 2025.** This level of profitability is impressive for a tech company that is growing so aggressively. (See slide 26)

Another really positive projection is the expected diversification of SoFi‚Äôs revenue line. SoFi expects both Galileo and its financial services products to significantly increase their share of revenue by 2025. **Financial services is expected to grow from 2% of revenue to 32% of revenue, while Galileo is expected to grow from 17% to 25%**. This will make SoFi a far more robust business both in terms of competition and any future economic downturns.

It‚Äôs important to look at any projected revenue with a degree of skepticism. As we all know from the Covid pandemic, things can change very fast. However if SoFi‚Äôs current performance is anything to go by, they should definitely have the ability to hit their projections.

Valuation

From the investor presentation, we know that post-merger, 9.3% of SoFi will be owned by current IPOE shareholders. The current market cap of IPOE (on Friday Jan 22nd) is $2.26 billion. This gives SoFi a current valuation of $24.3 billion (based on IPOE price).

SOFi‚Äôs 2020 revenue was $621 million. Dividing price by revenue gives us a **2020 P/S of 39.** This is undoubtedly high. Compared to Square which has a current P/S of 15 doesn‚Äôt make SoFi look like the most attractive investment. However when compared to Visa, which currently has a P/S of 22 and has negative 16% growth rate for the last year, SoFi starts to look more attractive.

Investing in a company like SoFi means investing based on future growth. Investing in projected growth definitely involves some speculation. If current valuation is based on future targets and the company doesn‚Äôt meet those targets, then the price will drop.

However if they do meet their targets, I believe S***oFi is undervalued at its current price:***

* SoFi‚Äôs projected revenue for 2025 is $3.7 billion. Based on the current price, this gives us a **2025 P/S ratio of 6.62.** Again, **comparing to Visa‚Äôs current P/S of 22, SoFi looks very attractive at current prices.**
* SoFi will also still be growing revenue 31% yoy in ‚Äò25. Visa has had negative revenue growth this year. Even discounting the pandemic, Visa‚Äôs average revenue growth over the previous 3 years has been \~11%.
* Comparing P/E ratios also looks favourable for SoFi. SoFi‚Äôs **P/E ratio in 2025 is expected to be 38**. While **Visa‚Äôs current P/E ratio is 42.** Focusing on net income for a tech company that will only be 4 years public in 2025 is misguided in my opinion. And Visa is definitely not the perfect comparison. But i do believe that these relative P/E ratios show some margin of safety for investors who buy in at today‚Äôs price.

Conclusion

In summary, SoFi passes all of my criteria for an incredible **long-term** investment:

* Their TAM is huge.
* They are in a slow moving, fragmented industry that is ripe for innovation.
* I didn‚Äôt touch on this in the post but they have a very strong management team. Look up CEO Anthony Noto‚Äôs track record.
* Their multi-product business strategy is a winner. It has led to high customer satisfaction and very strong unit economics.
* Their acquisition of Galileo gives them diversified revenue lines and the ability to build a strong data moat around their business.
* They are undervalued based on future projections.

Based an all of this, I strongly believe that SoFi has the opportunity to be a 10X investment.

*(Please note, that the above is not investment advice and just a conclusion I‚Äôve made for my personal portfolio)*",2021-02-03,20,0

Hi my fellow green astronauts. 

Many people are searching for the next trading platform they can call home. I‚Äôm here to give you some reasons why SoFi will be the new tendie machine. üßê 

Introducing: SoFi

Few Big Reasons:

- All in one platform. Sofi intentionally created an ecosystem so you‚Äôd never have to leave their app.
You can do banking, refinance loans, buy crypto/ STONKS, etc all on one app. No need to hop from app to app anymore.

- The only brokerage with a modern UI. 
The exodus of R.H. users aren‚Äôt going to stay on Fidelity‚Äôs boomer platform for long - think of it as a temporary bandaid until they find a more visually appealing app 

- SOFI‚Äôs CEO has confirmed via Twitter they‚Äôre in works of adding Option chain / and extended market hours

- Backed by Chamath Chamath Chamath.

- Huge positive/free publicity due to Vlad‚Äôs trade restrictions

Since the R.H. restrictions/backlash, SoFi has risen 28%. I except massive adoption/download as people move away from R.H. to the next shiny app.

No! Don‚Äôt do it. You need to switch to an established broker that has in-house clearing. 

Here is a list of which brokers use which clearing houses. 

https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/

If it says ‚ÄúApex‚Äù - stay the hell away. If it says Self clearing: No - stay the hell away. 

__*I know Rh is now self-clearing, but they do not have anywhere close to the required liquidity to handle the current volumes - so stay the hell away.__

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are GME or AMC gang or if you don‚Äôt plan on owning any of the meme stocks. Liquidity issues will effect other stocks too. Robinhood had to limit stocks like AMD, GM and even Starbucks. They can not keep up. Most of those other brokers also use the same clearing house - Apex Clearing. That‚Äôs a lot of volume to handle. They will be the weak link in the chain that causes the whole system to fail. They already did on Thursday. All the sketchy  shit pulled by various brokers was a direct result of Apex‚Äôs inability to keep up with demand. 

TLDR - find your broker on [this list](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/) and if they say ‚Äúself clearing -no‚Äù then you really should switch to a broker that is self-clearing

ktt0fs_SOFI,SOFI,What headwinds does SoFi face over the next 5 years?,"After Chamath Palihapitiya announced on Thursday that his fifth SPAC would be taking SoFi public, I began researching/skimming the investor presentation and really liked what I saw. SoFi is expecting unique members to grow 75% in 2021 to 3mm, which based on the last three quarters is a reasonable assumption. Additionally, they are projecting $1bn in revenue for 2021 with a note that if they receive a bank charter revenues could potentially hit close to $4bn by 2025.

One of my initial concerns is the bloated valuation of ~$16bn based on the current price of $IPOE, PIPE shares, founder shares, and warrants. When looking at multiples, it is definitely a premium vs. similar competitors such as LendingClub / LendingTree. However SoFi is unique as it has other revenue streams outside of lending so it is hard to find a perfect competitor. 

Overall I think SoFi is a solid company when you combine all 3 business segments - however I am not sure what‚Äôs stopping other banks from eventually building out their own 1 stop shop for all personal finance needs. What do you guys think?

hdburq_SOFI,SOFI,"SOFI wouldnt allow me to sell a stock, lost $15k","I bought $24k worth of JFIN at $19, tried to sell for $28 a few minutes later. SOFI had an error saying I couldn't sell. I called and the first lady I talked to looked over my transactions and said it was a mistake and transferred me to a broker. The broker told me it was all automated and wouldn't rest until next day. He said I was flagged a PDT back in April. I went back and read the email and I got a warning but never went above 3 trades in a 5 day period. They reset it and I was able to sell the next day for a $15k loss. I was able to buy and sell stocks up until that day but it was the first I tried to day trade. Is this legal? Do I have any recourse against them?",2020-06-21,10,16
