I have no idea how to do proper DD I just pick stocks that I like and think will do well. Has anybody else invested in this stock and if so, do you plan to hold or sell? Any information would be appreciated üëç

DILUTION INCOMING!,"As others have warned, although Virgin Galactic had a successful launch this week, there is no cause to celebrate.

What does this mean for shareholders? Dilution of your interest. Virgin is following the same path as prior meme stocks to sell sell sell to retail traders until it can do so no more. Expect the stock price to steadily decline as Virgin Galactic keeps pumping out offering after offering.[Anyone expecting moon money will be sorely mistaken as the stock plumets down into oblivion and goes into full meltdown mode.](https://youtu.be/MC0K3muUJp0?t=550)

Oh what about the backlog of customers you might say? Virgin currently has only 1 ""spacecraft"" capable of flying the 800 or so customers who purchased tickets in advance. Many of these tickets were purchased years ago for a fraction of the price that Virgin is currently selling them today and any money they've received in advance has already been spent. Meanwhile, Virgin's costs have gone up and the company is hemorrhaging cash faster than a drunken groomsman at a bachelor party. [They posted a $93 million loss in their last quarterly report.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/virgin-galactic-q1-earnings-report.html)

Are you bullish or bearish? 

Whatever your sentiment, be sure to load up on shares and/or options this month! After years of waiting, they finally begin commercial service this month with a flight to record data for the Italian Air Force after last month's successful test flight. This means we'll probably see a nice run all month long, then lots of volatility right around the flight. This means opportunity, possibly both ways, just don't get caught in a trap either direction!

This month is make it or break it for Virgin Galactic. A failure could mean bankruptcy. A success could mean 200%+ gains. I'm not telling you how to play it, I'm just saying that it's got some of the most potential, possibly both ways, this month.

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **There aren‚Äôt many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isn‚Äôt any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, you‚Äôll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that. I‚Äôll likely let Hungry Bot take the reigns this week since it‚Äôs the easier solution and has been extremely accurate this earnings season, generating [back to back 30 baggers](https://imgur.com/a/v5NLArJ) just last week.

&nbsp;

- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since it‚Äôs inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesn‚Äôt indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning we‚Äôve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so you‚Äôve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.

&nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There‚Äôs no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and you‚Äôre just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that they‚Äôre buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesn‚Äôt go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

There‚Äôs no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and you‚Äôre just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that they‚Äôre buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesn‚Äôt go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

For those that have been following on my journey I've posted all my plays over the last 2 months. Here are this week's picks and the reasons behind the trade.

# What am I selling this week?

I've looked at IV lists and charts and here are some plays that offer returns of my liking this week. Remember, I am not interested in ""getting rich quick"" through the market. This is a place where patience is rewarded and I am happy with a 10% quarterly gain. Those who seek fast returns are usually humbled by the market through a swift loss of capital.

&#x200B;

**Marathon (MARA)**

https://preview.redd.it/cax9jjp2oar71.png?width=2510&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb337af5738f4c180670e594d6be6eb1479dd9ba

Est. IV: 80%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $32, Nov 5th, 2021.

Return: $3 for $300 premium, 9% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $29, full profit above $32.

Details: If MARA stays above $29 in 5 weeks, the position remains profitable. MARA already in over-sold category as a proxy for crypto. Next support is around the $23 level. Keep an eye on crypto as this crypto miner will follow prices accordingly.

&#x200B;

**Palantir (PLTR)**

https://preview.redd.it/hb95fu23oar71.png?width=2522&format=png&auto=webp&s=19827708ec654c4980d5519e59e72754ae8d9c81

Est. IV: 55-60%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $24 strike, Nov 5th 2021

Return: $1.35 for $135 premium, 5.6% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $22.65, full profit above $24.

Details: Palantir almost broke out past $30 two weeks ago. The stock price has dropped nearly 20% just last week. IMO good risk-reward at these levels. If I get assigned I would have a cost-basis of $22.65 which would still be a solid entry.

&#x200B;

**Cloudfare (NET)**

https://preview.redd.it/rfa23je3oar71.png?width=2532&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfeee807a2b8b1d2ead7339f458f31487fc87b3d

Est. IV: 50%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $110, Nov 5 2021

Return: $5.25 for $525 in premium, 4.8% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $104.75, full profit above $110.

Details: NET was on a solid uptrend until last week where it broke through the 50 EMA. I am looking for a bounce off the 200 EMA (current level). To be safe I might sell the $110 strike for a bit more cushion. Stock price is $115 and should I get assigned my cost basis will be \~$105.

&#x200B;

**Virgin Galactic (SPCE)**

https://preview.redd.it/m7z8vzt3oar71.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6596bf2fa442d6adbfe4d387c7e9d19dbf3c3d

Est. IV: 50%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $22 strike, Nov 5 2021

Return: $1.55 for $155 in premium, 7% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $20.45, full profit above $22.

Details: The SPCE chart is something else and seem to be a repeating pattern. In my opinion we could be at the lows with the potential for a squeeze to the upside. This stock seems to take off on social sentiment often and as the option is short-dated and rip to the upside will allow us to maximize profit quickly.",2021-10-03,33,8

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you‚Äôre looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we‚Äôll experience. Since they‚Äôre reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What‚Äôs there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I‚Äôll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they‚Äôre Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven‚Äôt had much time to review any extra trades given that I‚Äôve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We‚Äôve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we‚Äôve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha. If you see any appealing plays I‚Äôve missed, feel free to let me know!

Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they‚Äôre Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.

All that being said, I haven‚Äôt had much time to review any extra trades given that I‚Äôve been extremely busy this weekend.

#Summary and Conclusion

We‚Äôve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we‚Äôve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha. If you see any appealing plays I‚Äôve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-08-01,373,143

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you‚Äôre looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we‚Äôll experience. Since they‚Äôre reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What‚Äôs there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I‚Äôll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

ole9oe_SPCE,SPCE,I made a mistake of YOLOing SPCE SP on 28/6,"I have 30/7 46.5P x 4 and 30/7 47P x 8. Those are CSP but I did not intend to take assignment. I thought with Branson on a successful flight I could have closed early when price soars, or just to scalp as it was trending up when I wrote the puts.

There were times when even if the price went higher than when I sold my puts, the premium just kept going up. I did not BTC early as it's then costing me twice as much to close, even when the price went up which is supposed to be favourable. Is it because of IV drastically rising?

Now I‚Äôm left with these options. A lot can happen in 2 weeks but just wanna see what your experience / advice is:

&#x200B;

1. BTC at a loss at about $12680 now in case it keeps going down. Premium I earned from selling CSP was $7205 so the real loss here is $5475
2. Wait till expiration for theta decay and hopefully can BTC at a lower cost, if it doesn‚Äôt keep going down
3. Take assignment and sell CC
4. Edit: Someone suggested rolling out and down, which I did forget.. I mostly sell CC and only swing trade CSP. Totally forget it can work the same way

Any opinion is appreciated. Thanks and have a good weekend!",2021-07-16,0,3
ojnpu9_SPCE,SPCE,"Daily Option Statistics for AMC, CLOV, GME, NOK, SPCE, AAPL, BB, TSLA, SOFI, WISH and others.","Hey everyone,

Good afternoon. As usual here is the daily option statistics for the most talked about stocks on WSB.

The biggest news of the day was NOK. A massive 10% on a large float stock. Great job to anyone who bought into the DD a month or so ago on NOK and made profit.

Other then that just a normal day. AMC(-7.65%), GME(-4.86%), and SPCE(-7.20%) were the biggest losers today. Everyone else kind of just slid around.

Below are the statistics for today.

ojnpu9_SOFI,SOFI,"Daily Option Statistics for AMC, CLOV, GME, NOK, SPCE, AAPL, BB, TSLA, SOFI, WISH and others.","Hey everyone,

Good afternoon. As usual here is the daily option statistics for the most talked about stocks on WSB.

The biggest news of the day was NOK. A massive 10% on a large float stock. Great job to anyone who bought into the DD a month or so ago on NOK and made profit.

Other then that just a normal day. AMC(-7.65%), GME(-4.86%), and SPCE(-7.20%) were the biggest losers today. Everyone else kind of just slid around.

Below are the statistics for today.

oibls8_UNH,UNH,"Expected moves. SPCE, TSLA JPM, GS, BAC, WFC and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** finished last week inside its expected move, up 0.5% vs the 0.7% options were pricing. However, markets moved lower Thursday before a rally to end the week. That move lower briefly took options implied volatility higher.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$431** as a *bearish consensus* and **$440** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** ‚Äì The VIX was slightly higher on the week closing above 16. That was lower than the levels above 20 it saw Thursday morning.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22.5. Near-term options remain compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.8%**
* DIA **1.2%**

&#x200B;

### In the News

The Virgin Galactic flight with Richard Branson went off successfully. **SPCE** options are pricing about a **22%** move for this week.

There was a lot of attention paid to **Tesla TSLA** chart technicals and momentum last week. Here‚Äôs how the options market is pricing TSLA, with a one week expected move of more than **4%** and a one month expected move (that includes earnings) of about **12%.**

ON FAA News stock went up about 40%

On SRB Flight news stock went up about 25% early morning and ended with about 4% up

Tomorrow is big day, they successfully completed a crewed flight and i hope looking at trend this goes to Moon.

Let me know your thoughts. It's not a MEME stock.

I'm not trying to pump it and trying to do a healthy discussion.

Adding Below:

Forgot to mention landing was so smooth and it's a flight, not a rocket, which makes a lot of difference IMHO. Imagine if you can fly to Australia in couple of hours (Not saying they have said that, just wildly thinking). It's 1.3 T industry by 2040 and not much player so far.

oibdub_V,V,"Branson Completes Virgin Galactic Flight, Aiming to Open Up Space Tourism","https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share

SPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. ‚Äî Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.

On Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.

More than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. ‚ÄúThe whole thing was magical,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Branson‚Äôs flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company ‚Äî Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon ‚Äî has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.

In each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations ‚Äî and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre putting their money where their mouth is, and they‚Äôre putting their body where their money is,‚Äù said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive, frankly.‚Äù

At 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.

Although Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots ‚Äî David Mackay and Michael Masucci ‚Äî and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.

This flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.

Stephen Colbert of the CBS program ‚ÄúThe Late Show‚Äù introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.

When the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.

Mr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company‚Äôs chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.

As the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.

For well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson‚Äôs company.

After years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.

Founding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career ‚Äî and a fortune estimated at $6 billion ‚Äî building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman‚Äôs flair.

What became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.

The Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.

The spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson‚Äôs penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group‚Äôs businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson‚Äôs.

Virgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors ‚Äî and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company‚Äôs flight suits.

The Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic‚Äôs space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.

Mr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.

The first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.

In 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.
The mishap was revealed this year in the book ‚ÄúTest Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut‚Äù by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how we didn‚Äôt lose the vehicle and kill three people.‚Äù

Mr. Bezos‚Äô flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.

Although Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.

He will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.

Neither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.

Mr. Bezos‚Äô company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic‚Äôs SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.

The company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule‚Äôs windows, and called Virgin Galactic‚Äôs Unity ‚Äúa high-altitude plane‚Äù in contrast to New Shepard‚Äôs rocket.
Mr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait to join the club!‚Äù he added in an Instagram post.

Blue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic‚Äôs earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.

Joy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.

The era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.

In December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.

Another company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.

The orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy ‚Äî Axiom‚Äôs three customers are paying $55 million each ‚Äî while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.

But how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?

Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. ‚ÄúBased on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,‚Äù she said in an email, ‚Äúwe see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.‚Äù

Mr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.

‚ÄúPer minute, it‚Äôs like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Two decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. ‚ÄúWally Funk was one of our first customers,‚Äù Mr. Anderson said. ‚ÄúThat would have been like 1998.‚Äù

The ticket price then was $98,000.

At one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.

Now this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires ‚Äî Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.

‚ÄúIf anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it‚Äôs Branson and Bezos,‚Äù Mr. Anderson said. ‚ÄúThey have the reach and the cachet.‚Äù",2021-07-11,2284,468

Mr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.

The first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.

In 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.
The mishap was revealed this year in the book ‚ÄúTest Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut‚Äù by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how we didn‚Äôt lose the vehicle and kill three people.‚Äù

Mr. Bezos‚Äô flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.

Although Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.

He will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.

Neither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.

Mr. Bezos‚Äô company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic‚Äôs SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.

The company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule‚Äôs windows, and called Virgin Galactic‚Äôs Unity ‚Äúa high-altitude plane‚Äù in contrast to New Shepard‚Äôs rocket.
Mr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait to join the club!‚Äù he added in an Instagram post.

Blue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic‚Äôs earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.

Joy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.

The era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.

In December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.

Another company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.

The orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy ‚Äî Axiom‚Äôs three customers are paying $55 million each ‚Äî while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.

But how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?

Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. ‚ÄúBased on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,‚Äù she said in an email, ‚Äúwe see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.‚Äù

Mr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.

‚ÄúPer minute, it‚Äôs like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Two decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. ‚ÄúWally Funk was one of our first customers,‚Äù Mr. Anderson said. ‚ÄúThat would have been like 1998.‚Äù

The ticket price then was $98,000.

At one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.

Now this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires ‚Äî Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.

‚ÄúIf anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it‚Äôs Branson and Bezos,‚Äù Mr. Anderson said. ‚ÄúThey have the reach and the cachet.‚Äù",2021-07-11,2281,468

SPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. ‚Äî Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.

On Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.

More than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. ‚ÄúThe whole thing was magical,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Branson‚Äôs flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company ‚Äî Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon ‚Äî has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.

In each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations ‚Äî and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre putting their money where their mouth is, and they‚Äôre putting their body where their money is,‚Äù said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive, frankly.‚Äù

At 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.

Although Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots ‚Äî David Mackay and Michael Masucci ‚Äî and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.

This flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.

Stephen Colbert of the CBS program ‚ÄúThe Late Show‚Äù introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.

When the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.

Mr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company‚Äôs chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.

As the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.

For well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson‚Äôs company.

After years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.

Founding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career ‚Äî and a fortune estimated at $6 billion ‚Äî building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman‚Äôs flair.

What became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.

The Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.

The spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson‚Äôs penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group‚Äôs businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson‚Äôs.

Virgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors ‚Äî and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company‚Äôs flight suits.

The Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic‚Äôs space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.

Mr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.

The first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.

In 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.
The mishap was revealed this year in the book ‚ÄúTest Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut‚Äù by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how we didn‚Äôt lose the vehicle and kill three people.‚Äù

Mr. Bezos‚Äô flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.

Although Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.

1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

‚Äúto be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience‚Äù

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn‚Äôt give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market‚Äôs value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn‚Äôt be a big player, as it‚Äôs entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve guessed by now, this isn‚Äôt hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it‚Äôs valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it‚Äôs rational, but it‚Äôs safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector‚Äôs projected growth and the company‚Äôs own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic‚Äôs exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What‚Äôs stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push‚Äôs to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday‚Äôs flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday‚Äôs price.

The main determinant in Monday‚Äôs price action will be how Virgin Galactic‚Äôs flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

ogj8jk_SPCE,SPCE,SPCE IV Crash,"SPCE is not like AMC or GME where unexpected happened. Everyone knows about SPCE weekend event for weeks so IV crash for those calls and puts will be really brutal tomorrow and Monday. 50$ strangle for next week was selling today for 16$. Anything b/w 34 and 66, you will make money. 

Also Stock went up today 15% and puts did not go much down. 

Let's see what next week brings for SPCE. I am expecting to close next Friday around 45 and kill and calls and put. 

And we will have secondary around 40 by the end of the month. They have just 3 months of cash left and their commercials flights won't go in the air for the next 18 months. They will definitely need a lot of cash 

Chamath sold his personal SPCE stake in March at 27 for 221m. Who needs that much cash anyway? Given he is the biggest pumper and insider for SPCE, I cant expect secondary offered at more than 40.

And if somehow the flight gets delayed, it will open below 40 on Monday.",2021-07-08,22,42
of1dnd_SPCE,SPCE,Virgin Galactic (SPCE) Space Flight play,"Hello together,

I don't care about opinions on the company, it's future or value, but only about the flight it's taking on the 11th of July. I've stumbled upon this so often recently, and volume reaches more peaks than ever.

I will do what I mention regardless, but I might adjust how, so I would appreciate your input.

SPCE has been jumping up and down like crazy, as far up as $55 and down to below $44 (in the last 5 days only).

Looking at volume, social media sentiment and increasing news on outlets, media and investment pages of all kinds, I bet on it continuing an insanely wild ride that might bounce even more than it did so far the closer it gets to the flight date.

I have 2 options on how I want to do this, using leverage:

A) sell on Friday right before closing hours. Usually events like these ramp up insanely in the last couple of minutes because some people couldn't decide to join or not and do it last second at any price

B) sell on Monday and hoping for a success and hoping the good old ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" does not hit too heavy

Since it's bouncing up and down so much (today in a range from $44 to $49) I want to aim at a price of 44-46$ today or latest tomorrow. The media battle of Bezos vs Branson is a great title to draw people in regardless of how it continues.

How would you do it if you had no position as of this very moment? I'll be very interested to see what your opinions are and hope it drops to $44 today, otherwise I have to see tomorrow and hope it goes down again.",2021-07-06,5,11

SPCE's IV is very high right now and I believe it will increase up to the launch like earnings momentum. I saw someone talking strategies for this earlier in a post and decided to make a dedicated post. My plan is to wait for the large run up and sell a short call vertical with short strike about 10% out from the first consolidation. I'm thinking my long strike about 15% out from first consolidation. I'm thinking Aug. 20 expiration is the perfect theta value but close enough that they don't release new news.

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** finished the week above its bullish expected move, up 1.5% vs the 0.8% options were pricing. The SPY has moved more than its expected move and established new highs over the past few weeks, while its implied volatility (and expected move) has compressed as moves have mostly been in one direction to the upside.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a **0.7%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. That corresponds to about **$429** as a *bearish consensus* and **$437** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** ‚Äì The VIX was lower into the holiday weekend, closing at around 15. That‚Äôs the lowest levels of market implied volatility since pre-pandemic. In January 2020, before the Covid sell-off, the VIX was as low as 12. Its historical mean is near 19 but that incorporates long periods of time of low volatility (and the VIX in the low teens) with occasional bouts of extreme volatility and spikes in the VIX.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22. In other words, near-term options are compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

nk3oo0_SPCE,SPCE,Follow up to my SPCE strangle,"Follow up on my SPCE strangle play from Friday.


Background;
SPCE has a lot of social media and financial news chatter recently.  It‚Äôs on Reddit and Bloomberg all day.

So I examined volatility, option pricing, stock trading volume, and history.

SPCE had over 45 million trading volume Friday.  The ten day average was 23.5 million and the 90 day average was 17.8 million.

Stock was trading at $21.61.  It closed Thursday at $19.81.  It was as low as $15.79 five days ago.  Over the past month it had been as low as $13.87 and as high as $24.29.  

The news cycle and tech rotation seem to impact SPCE frequently.

IV was over 100 for 30, 60, and 90 days.

So I examined a strangle at 716 expiry for p21/c22 strikes.

716 p21;

IV 106%,

Delta -0.39,

Gamma 0.04,

Theta -0.03,

Vega 0.03.


716 c22;

IV 108%,

Delta 0.56,

Gamma 0.04,

Theta -0.03,

Vega 0.03.



Open interest was over 1000 for each.  Volume was over 900 for put and over 400 for call.

I fundamentally believed that this company would have swings in price both up and down over the next few months.  This seemed a good play to take advantage of ongoing high volatility.


So I bought one‚Ä¶
SPCE 716 strangle p21/c22 for a total premium of $676.36.


UPDATE for Monday;
SPCE surged premarket.

At open, my 50% profit limit order was exceeded for the call leg and closed.

Later in the day, when there was not immediate rebound noted, I closed the put leg for a loss.

So the call leg closed for $514.31 and the put for $191.31 for a total yield of $705.62.

Net profit of $29.26.  ROI of 4.3%.  Not bad for a Friday to Monday play.

One note, unlike my TSLA strangle, I did not close the put leg at open with a market order.  I believe based on the daily chart that if I would have done so, my profit margin would have been closer to 6% similar to the TSLA play last week.  I probably will start converting the losing leg to a market order premarket in the future if the winning leg is going to be in the money at open.

njgd4e_SPCE,SPCE,The case for SPCE short: Fading the positive news.,"Taking a lot of effort to not make cheesy puns about a potential sell setup on SPCE.  Here's the bear case;

&#x200B;

Quick fire points;

&#x200B;

* There's been highly positive news. We commonly find highly positive news in highs. An example of this is the move on PLTR on demo day into 26 and from there a hard downtrend began.
* SPCE has been in a downtrend for a long time and is retesting a breakout.
* In this rally SPCE has still made no higher high.

&#x200B;

Details.

&#x200B;

SPCE broke the low of the rally from the start of 2021. This seems like a significant break and now we're only retesting that level.  If we break above here it's very likely a retest would happen and a ""Safer"" buy could be made.  At this point the more obvious trade seems to be to sell into the resistance retest.

https://preview.redd.it/waascvriix071.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a06bfe417055efcf4be98988da4e338dd23bbd5

The trend remains down and this move up has only taken us to the 76 retracement of the last swing down. This is the most famous of the fib retracement levels for the high/low being made.  These are very low probability spots to buy and that usually makes them high probability spots to sell.

https://preview.redd.it/t73qktgsix071.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=0285bc660b7fec6262aef7664a7bd1bc70947013

All good trades start with defining a good area to trade off, one letting you establish a clear stop loss. Here the stop is above the swing high at 26.  If that hits, this is no longer holding the lower lows and lower highs trend this trades attempts to profit from.  After a good level, comes a good entry signal. And here we have a butterfly pattern give us that.

https://preview.redd.it/ahf4k3w9jx071.png?width=1367&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeef791042e6c0a58b80ba2134c0969a0a699e14

Buy the strangle now and close when it‚Äôs at a decent profit as a whole‚Ä¶ or maybe even close each limb independently on green and red days as appropriate for profit.


So I bought one‚Ä¶
SPCE 716 strangle p21/c22 for a total premium of $676.36 (minus fees).

The company recently announced there is a issue with its carrier plane called the Whiteknight2.  So now they cannot fly to space as originally planned.  

The maintenance issue was detected moments before they were planning to have a test flight this month.   We don‚Äôt yet know the issue but could add months to the delay.

n9b8y5_SPCE,SPCE,VIRGIN GALACTIC CATALYST," Lets start with this...

94.2% of the shares available to short have been shorted. (Borrowed & sold at market)

34.2 million shares are estimated to be our shorted shares.

We know 161 million shares available to trade publicly. We also know 70% of the shares are held by insiders & hedge funds. This leaves 30% of 161 million = 48.3 million shares available for shorts to buy back.

So the ""actual"" short interest is 34.2 million / 48.3 million = 71%.

This will likely get higher as the flight is announced, more shorts will pile up.

Additionally, as we've seen during GME/AMC, during the squeezes, hedge funds & day traders buy in to hold more shares hostage for quick cash at the expense of shorts.

This will go very very bad for shorts if a flight is announced and executed properly. Which is a pretty good chance, as the engineers had more then enough time to fix the problem and likely add improvements to SS2 that were implemented on SS3.",2021-05-10,27,32

lktgg1_MAR,MAR,SPCE DD - Test Flight Delay,"Hello all!

Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. 

Let's talk most recent timeline:

**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.

Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. 

**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. 

**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.

**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:

1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements.
2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. 
3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)

Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. 

**Surviving to 2025:**

This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. 

Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.

There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. 

Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

**Beyond 2025:**

[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:

Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M

Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN

Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share
2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share
3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share

What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.

Let's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. 

If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. 

**Beyond 2030:**

**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**

The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.

1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.
2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.
3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.
4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.
5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.

**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**

While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.

**Let's Talk Technology:**

[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. [Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s)

Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. 

The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. 

In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

**Bear Case:**

1. What if it explodes?
   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies.

Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.
2. SpaceX:
   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.
3. It is a hype driven stock:
   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**.

Didn't see this although it was announced earlier today. It explains the dip that occurred today for Virgin Galactic which is surprising as I didn't realize why it wouldn't have gone up a lot a day before their test flight but now it makes sense since there will be no test flight tomorrow.

This is nice in that it will allow people more time to decide what they want to do before the flight, but also really sucks for those who held through yesterday's 60+ gains when it could've been amazing time to sell high and buy back in on a dip.",2021-02-12,7,14

lgb6x1_SPCE,SPCE,SPCE DD - Major catalyst makes for major fork in the road,"I've [written](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPCE/comments/l3qzt5/ultimate_spce_dd_3rd_grade_reading_level_post/) [extensively](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginGalactic/comments/l8yvgj/test_flight_announcement_megathread/) [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginGalactic/comments/l6kw8g/spce_dd_i_like_the_stock_but_also_its_crazy/) Virgin Galactic (SPCE) over the last year. It's my favorite stock - I moderate the subreddit and discord, I've held 1000 shares since $9. I like this stock, I like this company. That said, I'm not going to rehash the stuff I've said a million times here, read the previous linked DDs for that, but I do want to provide an update in terms of where we're at, short term catalysts, what comes next, and why this could be a smart short term or long term play with both bull and bear options.

If you've been on Reddit for long you may remember the ""Pleas fly again"" meme from mid-December. For those unaware , the story is this: someone bet their life savings on call options ahead of the last Virgin Galactic test flight, the flight aborted, and they probably wound up losing all of their money. They tweeted the company immediately after asking them to ""Pleas fly again"" to save their calls. Was sad. But a little funny let's be honest.

Anyway, two months have passed and boys, it's time to fly again. Last week Virgin Galactic announced a new flight window that opens on February 12th, in line with my long-form DD's projection that it would be announced soon. To be clear, this is a flight \*window\* in that the flight could occur from February 12th onward, but is not guaranteed to occur on the 12th. It's worth noting their last flight occurred one day after the beginning of the flight window.

That said, the test flight \*is\* happening. You know what else is happening? The stock is $55 a share. If you haven't followed SPCE closely this may surprise you. It has traditionally bounced around in the low 20s to low 30s, getting more into the 30s on good news and heading back to the 20s on bad news or in sympathy with market downturns.

So why does it matter that the stock is at $55 a share? Because it's on a real ripper of an uptrend right now. I'm too lazy to screenshot the chart and do fancy squiggly lines but google ""SPCE"" and tell me if the line is going up or down. It's going up. And so we're quickly approaching what could be a dramatic catalyst for the stock -- its first trip to space as a publicly traded company -- while also in a very bullish uptrend, and with retail attention in investing at an all time high. Sounds like a pretty good set-up to me.

But wait, there's more.

On the subreddit, we knew about the test flight a full two days before it was announced because one of their test pilots went on an Italian Space Podcast and said to expect it Monday. The podcast was translated by someone out there and I had it confirmed with a translator and just like that, the company announced it just as he said. Another thing that was said was in that podcast was that in the month of Februrary we should expect an announcement that their \*second\* spaceship is complete. No specific timeline here but SPCE's earnings call is on the 25th. That'll be another nice catalyst on top of the flight.

But wait, there's even more.

[https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

Click that link, and look three rows down. That's our boy. Sitting at 71.95% short interest is Virgin Galactic. Is this a GME situation? No, nothing ever will be. But did most of these shorts probably enter their positions in the 30s and 40s? That would be my bet. And so we have a stock trading near its all time highs, sitting on top of 72% short interest with two near term catalysts, in an environment with unprecedented retail interest and hype around the industry. Could it squeeze? Maybe. I'm done trying to understand the mechanics of short squeezes.

And so really what we're on the cusp of here is a pretty classic bet. Many of you have bemoaned that this sub is no longer about making bets on companies, well here's a great set-up. This goes one of two ways, really:

1. The flight is a success - stock goes up a lot - long bet here is calls or shares. I'm long 1000 shares
2. The flight fails - stock goes down a lot - bear bet here is puts or shorting but the risk here for shorting is big if the flight succeeds

The last time the flight failed it dropped like 20%. At its current levels I wouldn't be surprised for a failure to bring us back into the 20s.

The really exciting part though, is what happens if the flight is a \*success\* because the answer is - we don't know.

When Virgin Orbit's (sister company, not related to the stock) launch was successful, Richard Branson was ALL over CNBC, Yahoo Finance, everywhere and anywhere talking about it. SPCE traded up in sympathy with the good news.

When they simply announced the flight date the stock went up like 15% that day.

Other than that, we simply don't know what will happen if the flight succeeds, especially in this ridiculous bull market. We could very well see some proper moon action. The stock's up over 100% YTD. Could it double again? I don't know. But I'm pretty sure a successful flight here would be at least 15% if not 20%. Add in the short interest and other factors mentioned above and I don't know what to tell ya.

Again, this is not investment advice and you should not just trade based on stuff people on the internet say, but this is my personal thought process as to what could play out over the next few weeks that I'm sharing with you all.",2021-02-09,43,15

They shot up recently on news of a test flight this month along with the ARKX announcement. Their 5-10 year plan with hypersonic point to point travel is quite intriguing.

leqej4_MAR,MAR,"Best Call Play? $SPCE, $APHA, $CRSR, or $MVIS","New to Reddit. Thanks in advance!

As we know, for options we need two things: timing and direction. 

With that timing, I like playing around events. This usually eliminates one variable. Now, just need direction (call or put). 

Across several threads, I‚Äôve seen multiple posts on these four. 

CRSR: Pre-market earnings 2/9. 

SPCE: Test fight 2/13 and likely inclusion in new ETF ARKX. 

APHA: Merger and implied discount on calls 

MVIS: r/MVIS

Curious on your, of course non-financial advice, thoughts. 

Thanks!

Right now, I only have 1 APHA $15C 2022

Due to earnings, 2/9, was leaning towards CRSR first for quick play around earnings.

Edit: Fix typo

Edit 2 09FEB2021: 
Learning:

This has been great leaning. My fundamental initially strategy is a great way to lose money in options, and after reading many threads (which I should have done before posting...sorry), the very common mistake new option traders make. Thank you for saving me money on CRSR. Hopefully, this will educate others. 

I‚Äôve also learned about applying credit/debit spreads to reduce downside risk, but capping profits. I also didn‚Äôt fully appreciate how this allows you to buy a significant number of contracts with your money. In my case with my funds and a debit spread, I could get approximately 4x the buy contracts by selling the calls, which is a nice multiplier for the max profit (if it works out). I‚Äôll need to map it out in excel to exactly see the break even price equivalent of just buying calls and not selling the spread calls. 

Again, thanks! I‚Äôm in APHA 2022, MVIS 2022, and PSTH Mar 2021.

Edit 3: If I did my math right, my head just exploded with the power of the spreads. 

$1350 spending power

Debit Spread
Buy MAR $35 Calls @ $3.70
Sell MAR $40 Calls @ $2.80
Results in 15 contracts spread. Is there a ratio of strike price spread to contract price spread that is an ideal minimum?

Just buying MAR $35 Calls would be equivalent of 3.65 contracts. 

The stock would have to get beyond $51.85 (from ~$32) by MAR to make calls only the better strategy. 

Did I do that right? Crazy.",2021-02-07,264,236

This is literally bulls panic selling because their isn‚Äôt a test flight announcement yet.

First of all, the NM lockdown doesn‚Äôt end until WEDNESDAY. That‚Äôs when tiered opening begins and that‚Äôs when we can start looking for updates. They can update us right now cause they don‚Äôt know what color their county will be on Wednesday.

Even if the flight is pushed to January who literally gives a fuck? It‚Äôll be up to 40-50 by February then boo hoo.

k3zh7x_SPCE,SPCE,Thoughts on Virgin Galactic Holdings ($SPCE)?,"I'm feeling pretty bullish on this one.   


Commercial flights were supposed to start this year, but delayed into 2021 because of Covid and other factors. Ticket price seems to be at least $250.000, but if you can afford that for a ticket, you are probably already rich as fuck, and willing to spend that and hell of a lot more on a trip to space.   
If I was rich, I'd want to visit space at least once in my lifetime.  


To my knowledge, there is no other public company offering this kind of service any time soon (correct me if I'm wrong), since SpaceX is not public, and Blue Origin is not public.  


Obviously a long hold, but as soon as flights start taking off (and passengers doesn't come back dead), buying before the space-flight hype is probably a smart choice if you are interested in this type of stock.  


I have a feeling, buying some for the long haul is the right play.

Edit: Apparently NASA just signed a contract with SPCE that runs until 2023

Don‚Äôt get me wrong there are risks, but rescheduling the flight because of Covid is different then rescheduling because of engineering issues.

Also this is not a pump and dump, selling after the test flight won‚Äôt make sense.  As even after the test flight who would want to sell with so many more positive catalysts coming up that I mentioned above.

k0mth2_SPCE,SPCE,"SPCE is far more than Space Tourism, allow me to shed some light","Hello, World!

The moment is finally upon us for SPCE to start making serious moves and this is pre-revenue, pre-flight, and pre-publicity. So what is all the hype, why are people confident in its future, and why are they right? One this is for certain this is NOT, I repeat NOT, just a space tourism company.

Let me first introduce you to the staff and some key players:

Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  
CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  
CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  
CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.

Noteworthy Investors:  
Vanguard  
Bank of America  
Morgan Stanley  
ARK  
Boeing  
Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  
Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)

Partners:  
Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  
NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  
Under Armour (suits)

Timeline of events:

1. Q4 2020 - Q1 2021: A final round of test flights which were supposed to occur during the window of November 19-23. This was delayed due to the New Mexico lockdown. COVID depending this test flight could still possibly happen before the end of 2020, if not very early 2021. This test flight will mark FAA approval and will be carrying a revenue generating payload, being the first revenue to be generated by the company...well...ever.
2. Q1 2021: Sir Richard Branson himself will take a flight up marking the start of commercial operations, the start of publicity and marketing, and the re-launch of ticket sales. So far roughly 600+ tickets have been sold and these will be the first clients to go up. Notable clients include: Leonardo DiCaprio,¬†Tom Hanks,¬†Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie,¬†Russell Brand, Lady Gaga,¬†Katy Perry,¬†Justin Bieber,¬†and Ashton Kutcher. The interior of SpaceShipTwo has 16 cameras which will be engaged during the duration of the flight and will capture these stars, quite literally in the stars as they float around in microgravity for several minutes. This will be recorded and surely uploaded to their social media. I imagine some of these individuals like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga will attempt to shoot a music video using this footage. Ticket sales will also resume again at this point.
3. 2021: For the rest of 2021 Virgin Galactic will be sending clients to space all the while they will be pushing profits in R&D for future endeavors, such as the hypersonic point-to-point travel which will be discussed later. They will also be building out more Spaceports and ships in order to conduct more flights. According to the last investors meeting, each spaceport is predicted to generate $1B/year.
4. Around 2025: The hypersonic point-to-point ship will be complete and ready for commercial operation. This will revolutionize human travel. To put it into perspective, the International Space Station circles the globe in 90 minutes, and when this plane is complete, so will we. Preliminary indicators suggest that a trip from NYC to Sydney, Australia would take roughly 30 minutes.
5. The possibilities are as limited as space and I won't make your eyes bleed as we talk hypotheticals. I do however want to address highly likely revenue streams we could expect.

Revenue Streams:

1. Space Tourism
2. Hypersonic point-to-point travel
3. Space Force [https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/](https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/)
4. NASA Contracts ( astronaut training, payloads, taxi services, etc)
5. Booster Services 
   1. Now, there is no news on this, but this is my prediction and what I would attempt to achieve. As hypersonic travel becomes the standard way for humans to traverse the globe there will need to be a way to make it possible and affordable for the general public. Virgin Galactic cannot achieve this on their own and current airlines (Delta, Southwest, etc.) cannot convert to Spaceship companies either. With Virgin Galactics unique approach and design, they could  become a booster service for airlines. Airlines will need to design a space plane that is capable of hypersonic travel and Virgin Galactic will use their mothership to carry these planes to sub-orbit.
6. While Virgin Galactic is currently operating in the sub-orbital space, I am sure they will begin working on deeper space projects for asteroid mining, moon operations, etc.

Common Objections and Rebuttals:

1. Who would be able to afford this and even if they could, why would they?
   1. There are around 42 million people in the world with a net worth of $5 million where $250k is extremely affordable. The price of the ticket is the same price of chartering a yacht for the weekend. Except instead of playing on a boat for two days, you go to space for a few minutes. Yes, the complete trip lasts around 90 minutes, but we are talking about going to Space. Virtually anyone would say that's something they long to do because that is human nature, if you look at people with high net worth they spend their money on much more ridiculous things. Not only is it human desire to want to go, it has the ""Johnson's effect"" as well. The Johnson's effect is an old sales analogy, where someone in your neighborhood would say ""Oh did you see the Johnson's got a new Porsche?"" Inclining you the observer who has the capital to feel the competitive nature and want to also have said clout. So yes, there is very much latent demand on this service. As explained earlier there are already 600+ pre-sold tickets including highly renown individuals and 900+ who have reserved a slot for a future ticket purchase. Note that these ticket sales only stopped because Virgin Galactic stopped them and will resume ticket sales Q1 2021. Virgin Galactic could currently handle 50 flights per year per plane and has recently finished their second plane, meaning they can handle 100 of the 1400 pre-purchased flights over 2021. So, even as Virgin Galactic scales, there is enough customers already to cover operating costs and the development of new planes for several years.
2. Wow so you get to go to space for all of two minutes?
   1. People who say this are people who can't afford it. That might sound harsh, but it is that simple. Very few humans would pass up on this opportunity for such a magical thing if they could actually afford it. 
3. It's not really ""space""
   1. Who cares? You get to experience microgravity and float around. You get to see the curvature of the Earth. You get to officially be called an astronaut. The media will not be attempting to point out this very minute, arrogant point. Again, only people who can't afford it will be pointing it out purely out of jealously or disbelief in the Space Age that is upon us.
4. People only invest in this because they can't invest in SpaceX.
   1. Not true. First off, they are completely different markets. SpaceX is orbital, Virgin Galactic is sub-orbital. A SpaceX tour would take you into deeper space for around a week and costs somewhere around $52 million. Secondly, even if SpaceX is a direct competitor I hardly see how that's a bad thing. Competition drives commerce, and to have Elon Musk being your direct competitor, that would only bolster Virgin Galactic. Thirdly, there is potential for partnership between these two companies in the future. A collaboration of completely different and unique technologies to overcome the challenges of the Space Age. Finally, SpaceX news and Elon Musk hype will mean space news and space hype, also helping Virgin Galactic.

What I imagine by 2035:

Spaceports all across the globe, connected by the Virgin Hyperloop (for those who don't know it's another Virgin project that allows humans to travel faster than the speed of sound through tunnels). At this point, Virgin Galactic will already be partnered with other major airlines who have created space planes, very much reducing the cost and barrier to entry. Meaning any human who would have normally have flown ""first-class"" will now have the ability to end up anywhere on the planet in under an hour. Virgin Galactic will also partner with shipping companies and if you're impressed with 2 day delivery, how does 2-hour delivery sound? Packages moved via space plane, then into a hyper loop to your distribution center, and finally automatically driven to your home via autonomous AI. All the while Virgin Galactic is innovating new technologies for deeper space missions, working with the Space Force, and continuing space tourism.  


This is not some flashy new technology, this is the revolution of human travel.  
This is not sci-fi, it is simply sci.  
The future truly is now and we all have an opportunity to be a part of it. Thanks for listening and big disclaimer, I clearly own SPCE shares, because at this point, it doesn't make sense not to.",2020-11-25,94,100

The company is on the verge of a test flight that will lead to FAA certification if successful.  Which after they will do one more test flight then start commercial operations with Richard Branson being on the first flight followed by many Hollywood actors this spring.

The test flight was going to be this week, but ultimately got rescheduled due to the state of New Mexico outing restrictions on people and businesses to slow the coronavirus down.  The new flight shout be within a few weeks.

Anyways, the stock has risen rapidly as of lately with options traders betting on a huge uptick soon.  Likely a successful test flight in the coming weeks.

I agree that Virgin Galactic has no revenue ... yet and has a lot to prove.  Specifically finishing up final testing this fall and launch of commercial operations in Q1 2021 with the first flight being with Richard Branson.   

The business of space tourism is very profitable and if they can deliver and scale the business with 5 spaceships by 2023 as planed they will be flying 1590 people a year making over $400 million of gross profit per year.  This includes projected revenue from training NASA astronauts and the Mach 3 sonic plane.

Tesla back then was a hope or a dream... not too many people believed in them.  Same with virgin Galactic now.  

So why did Tesla jump ?

They started bringing in REVENUE... even though the company was at a profit loss for years, that didn‚Äôt matter because bringing in revenue shows that people will pay you for their product.  

What about Virgin 

Virgin Galactic is right on the cusp of that now, they are transitioning from engineering to commercial operations.  If they can do that - which will be proven by full FAA certification and flying Richard Branson the stock and the value of the company will jump ... likely to a 25 billion market cap.  

Once they start bringing in paying customers (already lined up now). This will start bringing in significant revenue for the company.  

If they can on top of that show a business plan that shows they can scale the business through multiple spaceports and spaceships and theme parks let‚Äôs say.  Likely to happen with ex Disney CEO Micheal Coliglazier... this company will explode just on forward earnings.  This is easily a 50 billion market cap company !  Or share price of $250/share.

The tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes. Happy to talk more about how the tool works.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the  current  close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means  the stock is expected to stay the same or go low in the next few  days. The definitions are a bit loose but the stock usually makes a decent amount in reality.

# Bullish Alerts

**$BABA**   \- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving   average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).

**$CHWY**   \- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if   it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))

**$MSFT** \- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.

**$TWLO**   \- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it  stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool  is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$SPCE**   \- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a   week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can   break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**   with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it   breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance   level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))

**$SRNE**   \- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool   and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to   follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down   at some time.

**$JPM** \- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))

**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.**

**$MSFT** \- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.

# Bearish Alerts

**$SPCE**   \- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a   week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can   break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**   with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it   breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance   level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))

**$SRNE**   \- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool   and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to   follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down   at some time.

**$JPM** \- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))

Recently developed a tool that analyzes options flow from the entire day to make short term predictions of 1-5 days. Wanted to share some of the alerts for the next week with you folks. Please let me know if this is something that everyone likes here and if I should continue it.

The tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes. Happy to talk more about how the tool works.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the  current  close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means  the stock is expected to stay the same or go low in the next few  days. The definitions are a bit loose but the stock usually makes a decent amount in reality.

I wasn‚Äôt aware that there was a mandatory redemption. Only saw one day that the warrant ticker wasn‚Äôt trading before I looked into.

I knew when I bought the warrants that it didn‚Äôt expire until 2024 and that there‚Äôs a possibility for early redemption. I would expect that if there‚Äôs a mandatory redemption that I would get notification and/or get the favorable default option. In this case, i can‚Äôt come up with a scenario where someone would rather take $.01 per warrant as opposed to taking half share of a stock trading at $17.

I reached out to my broker (top well-known broker) they told me they didn‚Äôt get redemption terms and therefore did not send notifications to their warrant shareholders (I find this to be surprising). They directed me to the Warrant Agent so I reached out to them. WA say they don‚Äôt send notices to the shareholders because they don‚Äôt know who the shareholders are. It‚Äôs the broker‚Äôs job to notify their own clients, which I agree with. I use another broker also and I always get notifications on corporate events and option exercise/assign, etc. In addition, the WA said they have gotten several calls this week on this same issue, all clients of this same broker.

Title says it all, I realized I missed out on the power weaponized autism & meme stocks have on the markets. So when I first heard rumbles about SPCE I decided to jump in with calls - confident it would tank on earnings, which is why I then switched to puts near the top. My puts are still open, and they were worth a good amount more before Friday. We'll see how that plays out, I expect it to hit $10 in the next few weeks as the normies and boomers realize they've been memed.


I'm not positive but I'm pretty sure that if I had sold my $22 strike 2/21 calls on Feb 19 instead of Feb 14 they would have been worth ~$15k instead of the $2k I got (sold when share price was at $28, then it hit $37 the next week) But I'm not smarticle enough to understand IV crush.

Short interest rate is 19%, about 1.15 days to cover, and about 37% of total available float is shorted.** SPCE is currently considered ‚Äúhard to borrow‚Äù, putting pressure and fees on short sellers. **19% institutional ownership = much more sentiment and retail driven.**

**Sentimental**: There are several key factors at play for SPCE‚Äôs earnings this quarter. The first factor is the updated timetable regarding commercial flights. Previously, SPCE stated that first commercial flights will begin Q1/Q2 2020. **If the flight timetable is reinforced or even confirmed, it can be a very strong catalyst to keep the stock up.** Second factor at play is the revenue accrued from reservation deposits. **In September 2019, SPCE annouced they have 600 tickets sold, amounting to about 80M in revenue. As of 2/24/2020, SPCE‚Äôs website noted that all tickets have been sold out.** While a 750k revenue on 7.3B market cap seems dumb, the accrued revenue from reservations would be the biggest factor in the operational performance area. The last factor at play is the **potential for SPCE to announce an equity raise given the stock‚Äôs current high price.** **Depending on the price and shares released, it can materially affect the stock‚Äôs price downwards**. A 4th issue was concluded merely yesterday, as **SPCE finally registered its warrants.** This prevents a cashless exercise scenario, which would hurt the stock price due to a brief, but massive influx of shares. While total dilution would be smaller by 12 million or about 60%, a cashless exercise will wreck the short-term float. 31 million shares over the course of 5 years is much more manageable. One last factor is the current macro psychology**. Because we are near the tail end of the longest bull run in American history, traders are looking for even more aggressive trades to pull even higher returns.**

The question for this earnings is entirely a retail fueled sentiment show. If SPCE can keep up the retail hype through news and announcements, it can lead retail to stay stubborn with price action. In addition, since most of the price is driven by retail purchases, price action will reflect much more of the sentiments, rather than anything logical. Chance of a sustained short squeeze is almost nothing due to 1.15 SI Ratio.

**ROI : 31%, 98%**

TLDR long call $SPCE leaps for free money. 

Let‚Äôs take a stroll down memory lane. Famed fake meat purveyor and beloved meme stonk of 2019, $BYND, experienced massive moves from May through July over two ERs then proceeded to cuck everyone after announcing a secondary. 

This no moat nothingburger ran up to $14 billion market cap on the $1T worldwide meat TAM and a hail marry partnership from $MCD. If this $TSN assassin can pump 14B market cap then truly anything is possible. Buffet like moat. No one got a moat bigger than $SPCE. (Yes, I‚Äôm all in SpaceX and Blue Origin whenever they list - but they probably gonna IPO via Wall Street and those bastards will suck up all the tendies.)

Even if you don‚Äôt believe in the $SPCE story recognize that $SPCE is the meme stonk of 2020. It doesn‚Äôt even matter if you buy the story. By the time Sir BDB is done pumping his first flight we all gonna be eating space ship Cheerios. The noise has not even begun. Branson is the undisputed master showman of his generation. He‚Äôs neck deep in aviation and knows exactly how to print money in that industry, not to mention virtually everyone he‚Äôs been in. 

Chamath, who is sitting on a cool $1B in $SPCE tendoids, is about to roll up to a 1 hr free HSN advertisement on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk day after earnings. If you think this king maker gonna volunteer to take fire for an hr on live tv while his stonk crashes 20% you‚Äôre already in space cause you ain‚Äôt living on this planet. He knows the news is gonna be stellar. That‚Äôs why he agreed to show up. He‚Äôs gonna pump his bottom line another cool billion. I expect an announcement on first flight timeline and opening up reservations including a price hike auction system for first movers. 

https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1230182805541466113?s=21

Institutional investors. Take a look at the millions of shares folks like Vanguard are buying up. These people have teams of PhD number monkeys figuring out whether or not they should get into something and put those somethings in their portfolios. Your (and my) baby DD ain‚Äôt even in the same airspace. Just follow their money. 

Why 50? Market cap. For those of you who can‚Äôt math you take the shares outstanding and multiply by price per share. If you‚Äôre like me you think of companies in terms of market cap. If you stick your finger in your mouth and hold it up in the air that feeling you‚Äôre feeling is all the negative interest rate free central bank money sloshing around the world looking for a home. Hence 10B market cap for Virgin Galactic easier than your sister on prom night. Ergo 50 per share. 

Media blitz. Just getting warmed up:

https://www.instagram.com/tv/B83pn1-F4El/?igshid=wahwj4qsgjg7

And finally, $BA needs a win. They already in for $20m which is basically toilet paper money for these aviation monopolists. These guys are chomping at the bit to own commercial space. Expect an announcement where $BA is contracted to builds a fleet of next gen $SPCE ships. 

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm in for about 5m+ in 2021 and 2022 leaps so my money is where my mouth is. Check my post history.

ps. If I‚Äôm wrong it‚Äôs just money. No $ROPE , all good. 

pps. I‚Äôm not wrong.

Hey gang. I called this double pump move last week. It was fairly obvious. Usually a pull back follows the 3rd day but what makes this tricky is there is big news coming this week and next. 

What‚Äôs less obvious is my move. Do I sell all and go puts? Do I sell some and hedge with puts? Do I let it ride because I‚Äôm all in leaps and my thesis still holds - 50 this year, aka 10B market cap minimum. I‚Äôm leaning towards letting it ride. Then again, this is life changing loot. IV is in the stratosphere. 

Also, please don‚Äôt dm me asking my opinion on your moves. Just read my posts and you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôve done and what I‚Äôm thinking. 

Listen, by the time I post this it may be up even further. Hard to keep up with this rocket ship. Needless to say, I‚Äôm feeling blessed, grateful and humbled by this move and my good fortune to have been in for the ride. Peace and love to all. I‚Äôm feeling the love right now.

Update: taxes
Yes, I‚Äôve calculated very carefully how much I‚Äôll pay in taxes with a withdrawal. This is a 401k. 10% penalty plus Highest fed bracket. Thank gd I live in a no income tax state - as you all should be. 

Update: peak
I was up like 2.1m at peak - when spce was up over 30%. It‚Äôs backed off and as of 12:19p est I am up 1.85m.

f3xq7e_SPCE,SPCE,PSA: Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is ONLY a sub-orbital flight company,"The take off in price of SPCE this week prompted me to do some research, and I believe there is some misinformation circulating on this company. 

Virgin Orbit is a separate spin off that is developing orbital launch capability. Any talks of launch contracts for satellites would fall under them, and not Virgin Galactic. 

SPCE is, at this point, purely for space tourism and some scientific contracts for sub-orbital flight work. The technologies and capabilities are much different here, like a couple hundred kN of thrust on the Virgin Galactic spaceshiptwo vs multiple stages with thousands of kN thrust required for orbit (that‚Äôs the stuff being done by Virgin Orbit, SpaceX, and Blue Origin).

If you‚Äôre investing in SPCE please be aware of what they are and what they aren‚Äôt. If you think they are a viable business for sub-orbital tourist flights and research contracts for flying things up to that altitude, then go for it, but be aware they aren‚Äôt putting satellites into orbit, sending people to the moon, mining asteroids, etc.",2020-02-14,306,217

f3zwac_SPCE,SPCE,SPCE - It's just math,"I've been reading all these SPCE bullish posts and it seems like no one has figured out the math behind this company. I'm hearing valuations of 50B, 100B, etc. Currently it is valued at 5B per the ticker value. 

So lets do some math here.

5B valuation - company has 120M in potential revenue for the 600 customers (250k per ticket).

They will probably begin flying something after July since they are trying to reserve the first flight for Sir Richard for his 70th birthday, so I'd imagine the 600 pre-ordered customers will have to fly thereafter which should take up the rest of the year. 

At 5B, they are valued at almost 42x their revenue. That's at roughly $30 per share.

Then there's raging bull over there with 750k in options talking about seeing $50 end of this year, that's 8.3B valuation. only 69x their revenue. YEAH 69.

Then we have retard analyst over there telling his relatives to buy up those calls to make them proud on television talking about $60PT. Which is an 82x revenue.

Just think about it. Space tourism is big and all, but SPCE cannot scale like BlueOrigins or SpaceX. The moment these guys IPO, these analysts and fake bulls gonna hop right over like a gold digger.

And, even at 5B valuation, let's say a reasonable revenue forward is 20x. That's still 500M in revenue that it has to do. Do the math again, based on the 250k pricetag, that's about 2000 passengers a year. 

How many millionaires you think gonna drop 250k on a couple minute trip in space each year? 2000?",2020-02-14,160,228
f3z1fo_SPCE,SPCE,Let's talk about SPCE,"I was fortunate enough to put in 20k yesterday and wake up to a nice $3500 profit. Bought in again at end of day for 50k at 27 and now its up to 29 after hours.

Everybody has different ideas of what this stock *should* be worth, but as we've seen with TSLA the market is irrational and FOMO is a very powerful thing. Unless some bad news happens with SPCE I don't see it crashing down any time soon. 

Some people are saying they have 5 employees but from my quick Googling they have 280 employees so there is some misinformation being spread around. It's a risky stock for sure, but for me the potential gains of it shooting up to 50+, maybe even 100+ by end of year outweigh the risks of it going back down to 20. 

What do you all think of this stock?",2020-02-14,87,93
f2jet2_BIIB,BIIB,"$TMUS, $S, $SPCE and on and on gains for the day","A bunch of people have been messaging me about my gains from the $S and $TMUS merger I had posted about so I am making this post lazily to show.  Don't really feel like summarizing it all perfectly accurately so i'll post general summary and screenshots and y'all can see.  All-in-all was up $81k end of day max intraday was around $94k in the morning.  Not my best day ever but not going to complain either.

It is kind of hard to give all the exact numbers because I don't sell things all at once... but i will break down the summary for the day below.

Best gain was as much as 12,500% on the option i screen shotted below.  I sold most between 11,600-12,000% and only one contract at 12,500% :(

I messed up as I had $5,500 in calls that I had sold the day before on accident right at market close and couldn't correct it which would have netted around $12,000 extra profit.

* **$TMUS -** $280 --> $16-17k
* **$S** \- $5,500 --> $68,000+-

I have a lot of positions and make a lot of trades so it is hard to indicate the rest of the day, lol but needless to say I am not upset with where I landed.  Sold most of the $S and $TMUS - opened some shorts on $S even though prob not a good idea, etc.  Opened a bunch of new hedges and explored some new potential positions with some initial calls. Blah blah blah who cares.

I always expect some loss throughout day as I am hedging various positions and do not go all in and YOLO like y'all love.  However, through a bit more modest gains held down by my hedges I have protected myself from losing everything and instead come out on top on multiple occasions.

Posting my daily/weekly/monthly below as well.  Needless to say, it has been a decent 2020.  Started essentially trading using RH full time around Nov/December.

As of now this position is around 2mil. My buy in was just under 500k. This is a real money account for all you poor autists out there. Mod want to confirm, dm me we‚Äôll work it out. I‚Äôve been in since Dec 02 2019 , when this stonk was at 7 and change. Built position for next few weeks through 11 , 12ish. For those of you who are worried sell before first launch. Until then this only trades up as we get set for first launch sometime this summer. Free money. Most likely July 18th for Sir Brandaddys 70th bday. 

Been trading 20+ yrs never seen more free money than this.

UPDATE: know your Greeks. Delta and Gamma for my $SPCE positions. I‚Äôm already over the Gamma hurdle. As the stonk goes up, gamma goes down as delta asymptotically reaches its theoretical maximum - number of contracts x 100. I have 2800 contracts so my theoretical max delta is 280000. Aka at max theoretical delta, for every +1 dollar move in the stock I would make $280k. 

The only way to change this is to get more contracts. I once had a 1m delta on $X because the contracts were so cheap.

f18oud_SPCE,SPCE,SPCE is going parabolic very soon and this week is the best time to get in.,"SPCE has been consolidating for the past couple of weeks since the last time it went to the moon. It will do so again in the next week, if not the one after according to the charts and upcoming catalysts. Get in now if you don't want to miss out as I did last month! Some DD I've done on Virgin Galactic... Don't think it will go tits up.

The company

1. New Technologies and has successfully sent humans to space, twice. The second time [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPG0Hqhay8). The tech is working.
2. Boeing will invest $20 million in Virgin galactic for hypersonic planes [link](https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-investing-20m-in-virgin-galactic-to-design-supersonic-vessel-2019-10)
3. Many catalysts in the coming months. Conference presentation at [Barclay industrial select conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200121005626/en/) by the CEO, the [last time he spoke](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106006011/en/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Participation-Bank-America-Merrill) the stock rose 60% from Jan 9. ER a few days later on Feb 25. Richard Branson going on the flight himself. Risk of him dying is minimal because of point 1 above. Lastly, they are planning to send first customer to space later this summer in 2020.
4. They just  [opened registration](https://www.virgingalactic.com/join-us/) for commercial flights!  

Technicals

1. SPCE has been trading near the top of the last parabolic move since a couple of weeks ago. It pulled back a little and formed two new support levels. It has formed bullish patterns in multiple time frames - a bullish flag, ascending triangle, and a upward trend that hasn't been broken since the last parabolic move.
2. This stock is strong as fuck, the recent economic turmoil hasn't affected it a bit, it is still following the trend line and continues to consolidate at the top while slowly creeping up along the upward trend line while consolidating.
3. Last Friday it has just formed a higher low in the consolidation - a buy set up and it is safe to buy!
4. 25% of the stocks are shorts. When it breaks out of $20, they will get squeezed along with all the catalysts in the coming months.
5. Morgon Stanley has a target price of 60.  They say hypersonic travel  will have an $800 billion dollar total addressable market by 2040. SPCE  is at the head of the pack in developing the technology to enable  hypersonic point to point travel, so they could very well be a  disruptive force in this future industry.",2020-02-09,315,325

Considerations:

\-Given the genesis of US space-faring, almost all US companies involved in space travel have extensive operations in defense or weapons manufacturing. This presents certain ethical questions that an investor must consider.

\-Space travel is not profitable. Nearly all profits generated by these companies for their efforts in space came directly from government contracts. There are at present very few profit-motivations in outer space. An investor should be aware that the companies above act very differently from the widget manufacturers of Economics 101.

\-The allocation weightings above are based on my own inferences. I considered each company's market cap, as well as the proportion of space-related revenues to all revenues, but ultimately the allocations above are totally made up.

Considerations:

\-Given the genesis of US space-faring, almost all US companies involved in space travel have extensive operations in defense or weapons manufacturing. This presents certain ethical questions that an investor must consider.

\-Space travel is not profitable. Nearly all profits generated by these companies for their efforts in space came directly from government contracts. There are at present very few profit-motivations in outer space. An investor should be aware that the companies above act very differently from the widget manufacturers of Economics 101.

\-The allocation weightings above are based on my own inferences. I considered each company's market cap, as well as the proportion of space-related revenues to all revenues, but ultimately the allocations above are totally made up.

Considerations:

\-Given the genesis of US space-faring, almost all US companies involved in space travel have extensive operations in defense or weapons manufacturing. This presents certain ethical questions that an investor must consider.

\-Space travel is not profitable. Nearly all profits generated by these companies for their efforts in space came directly from government contracts. There are at present very few profit-motivations in outer space. An investor should be aware that the companies above act very differently from the widget manufacturers of Economics 101.

\-The allocation weightings above are based on my own inferences. I considered each company's market cap, as well as the proportion of space-related revenues to all revenues, but ultimately the allocations above are totally made up.
