I’m sad to say I expected much more positivity from SPG. The earnings look good to me and the guidance doesn’t look bad but I’d love to hear from others. I know many expected the dividend to get a raise which it did not but posting these numbers with covid still dogging the business seems impressive to me

pta59n_SPG,SPG,Simon Property Group (SPG),"Alright you retail obsessed retards it's time to throw away your pull ups and get a pair of whitey tighties because it's time we learn to whipe all by ourselves and invest in a stock that does all the work behind the scenes.

Simon Property Group owns mall properties and made a sexy comeback after covid so I'm here to give you some seriously juicy information about the stocks future here in the next coming months.

&#x200B;

One thing I've noticed is the sentiment around malls is that they have down syndrome and no one goes to them anymore.

You don't know what you have until it's gone.

Thanks to COVID everyone realized the mall is actually fun place to go hand out in air conditioning and shop at a Gamestop with a bubble tea.

The mall has been packed.

I am a small business owner, I own a ride and a business in a mall that is owned by SPG. I am going to give you some good information for you to read while your wife gets air tighted by not one but three men that are your better in every way, partly because they invest in SPG.

Yes there is a Gamestop in the mall I work in.

I am not putting in graphs or rocket ships BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT TURKEY TENDIES FOR BLACK FRIDAY AND HAM TENDIES FOR CHRISTMAS. HAM TENDERS!!! also because I assume the moderators are going to make this a bitch to post anyway but here it goes.

&#x200B;

Right now, September and October are the slowest months for malls. This won't effect the stock price in a negative fashion because we will still have to pay rent. Why does this matter for the next coming months?

I'll tell you why.

The mall charges all the stores more rent during November and December. This is perfect for a holiday stock buy because over the next 4 months you are going to see the price rise due to this and what's even better...

The stores have a natural break point attached to their rent agreements. This means if the store makes over a certain amount the mall gets a percentage of that.

This year is going to be huge.

The mall has been packed and I have been doing very well on both my companies. I pay SPG thousands of dollars for rent and it is going up a lot in November so I thought you all should know so all my money goes to your wife after the divorce.

Even though I jumped in late for the covid recovery I really like the stock and the dividends have kept me holding for many months.

&#x200B;

I am in with 99 shares 133ish average. (Fuck off I'm poor)

I will be holding until January.

l6eq5o_SPG,SPG,"Simon Property Group Stock Analysis, a high dividend REIT!","Hi guys, any thoughts on REITs? I have been analyzing a bunch of them. Simon Property Group (SPG) looks like an interesting play. With a price to FFO of 10, it looks undervalued in this expensive market. And on top it offers a stable dividend yield of over 5% which I found to be 66% of its FFO (so the payout ratio is 66% in relation to its FFO). The stock price has not gone back to pre-pandemic levels, still seems to be offering a bit of a discount. I calculated the intrinsic value and came up with a discounted cash flow price of $120 with a 10% annual discount rate and an 8% future growth rate for SPG.

SPG recently acquired Taubman which adds additional premium malls to its portfolio. And even in this economic turmoil they were able to increase their rent per square foot by around 3% which shows that the company has confidence in its business moving forward. There was also heavy insider buying in the market crash last year, which is a great positive indicator. And I really like its management team, David Simon the CEO reduced his salary to zero and other higher officials took huge pay cuts till the economy recovers showing that the management is business and shareholder oriented.

Many people are skeptical of mall business in future because of the rise in e-commerce, but the malls that Simon owns are premium high end malls in very touristic locations all over the world where people visit for fun and enjoying the ambience and experience. But nevertheless to counter the rise of e-commerce, Simon is exploring partnerships with Amazon to convert some of its mall space into Amazon's fulfillment centers. Please let me know your thoughts on SPG. If you are interested, please find out my detailed analysis of this company on my channel ""Investing Untangled""",2021-01-27,1,2

Important metrics used for REIT valuation and analysis.,"Hey guys, I did a detailed stock analysis of Simon Property Group (SPG), the biggest mall REIT. In this video I discuss the important metrics used for REIT valuation and analysis. SPG has come up quite a lot from its lows of last year, but it still has a long way to go. I came up with a DCF price of $120, suggesting that the company is modestly undervalued. Malls will be hit due to the growth of e-commerce, SPG is already in talks with Amazon to transform their malls. With a Price to FFO of 10, SPG looks interesting in this expensive market.

&#x200B;

**History**

Spark’s initial foray into the industry was through the agricultural community, following an introduction to a 1,200 strong agricultural co-operative called AGRIS. 

They were able to create a unique solution for AGRIS with the development of a co-operative structure, that would be managed by Spark while AGRIS would help to secure membership by leveraging its brand and member relationships.

Subsequently, Spark and AGRIS entered into a 20+ year management agreement and today AGRIS Solar Co-operative still remains the largest co-operative in renewable energy in North America. 

From this point the original goal of pursuing development and asset management opportunities in renewable energy expanded and management was able to leverage its success in early projects into other technical and professional service niches, creating synergies and diversification.

Through its acquired entities, today Spark provides round-the-clock service and manages critical infrastructure for some of the world’s largest renewable energy and power companies, as well as several of the world’s largest utilities.

Spark currently serves three major customer segments:

* Commercial & Industrial customers 
* Regulated Utilities 
* Renewable Asset Owners

**Actions that have helped Spark realize rapid growth include:**

* A strategic game-changer for the Company was the development of a partnership in a unique structure with Oakville Hydro; Spark lead the development, construction and divestiture of Sunny Shores, a 100-acre, 14 MW utility-scale solar project.


* Acquisition of Northwind Solutions, an experienced O&M and systems monitoring business focused on the renewable energy sector. Under Spark’s leadership, Northwind’s service business has grown to more than 400MW of assets under management in Ontario – making Northwind the leading independent renewable energy O&M service provider in Canada.


* Establishment of an innovative lease pre-payment program for agricultural and rural landowners in Ontario who receive long-term annual lease payments from renewable energy generation assets located on their property. Spark provides these groups with a lump sum payment in exchange for their future lease payments.


* Formed the Green Energy Co-Op (GECO) comprised of 18 solar projects with a 6,2 MW capacity and enters into a 20+ year agreement to manage GECO.


* Entered into a partnership with [Envision Digital International Pte Ltd](https://envision-digital.com/) and [Heliolytics](https://www.heliolytics.com/) to launch SolarCare™, a fully integrated operations and maintenance (“O&M”) program.

In addition, Spark has worked to develop longstanding relationships with customers focused on industries less likely to be impacted by recession or displacement (such as offshoring) – including food & beverage, warehousing for ecommerce and data centers.

They manage concentration risk by ensuring that no customer represents more than 10% of their revenue. Spark has made twelve acquisitions over the past seven years, and coupled with post-acquisition organic growth, this has led to substantial scale in their operations.

**Growth through** **acquisitions**

The Co-Founder & Executive Board Chair, Jason Sparaga, has over 20 years of experience in private company M&A, corporate finance, and merchant banking with an expertise in strategic growth as well as acquisitions, mergers, and business combinations.

Management clearly understands the many potential pitfalls associated with this business model and has an excellent track record of successful integrations in various sectors. Spark has recently begun expanding into the United States and has already seen considerable growth.

• In-house M&A team 

• 12 acquisitions completed to date 

• Multiples ranging from 2-6x EBITDA 

• Monitoring pipeline of 100+ targets

**Downsides**

* High level of debt. A large portion of this debt can be attributed to frequent acquisitions and the added expenses incurred during the integration period.

* New acquisitions and expansions have been temporarily delayed due to Covid.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

I believe Spark Power Group is significantly undervalued compared to their industry peers and will continue to experience strong consistent growth, further accelerated by industry tailwinds. Their management team is also clearly very passionate and driven and they legit seem like a straight up good group of folks.

The companies resilience throughout this pandemic makes me confident that they will continue to successfully execute in the future. Covid has temporarily delayed some of their debt repayment plans last quarter so that is something I will be keeping an eye on in the future.

kwlx19_SPG,SPG,SPG is about to go on another $20-30 up move. Buy calls now,"Update 2/23: fucking victory on this one! Congrats to everyone who bought April $105s or really any calls March expiration or later 

Update 2/4: SPG is rising again so I assume someone on the sub will get interested. Although it might be naive of me to think some people on WSB are still interested in more than just GME.  SPG did move from $80 to $102 on its last up move, and then retraced and formed a new strong floor around $91. Its been doing this for weeks where it rallies, gives up half the gains, and then rallies again.  If we get another $20 up move we’d probably be looking at hitting near $110 by end of the month before retracing to $100.  Happy trading everyone

It’s been consolidating around $80-85 for a month now, this is the new floor.  MACD is crossing to positive on the daily and monthly chart simultaneously and RSI is starting to tick up also.  

As Covid calms down and vaccination speeds up this reopening play will soar.  Price target for me is $105-110 over the next month, and $125-130 sometime in the April-June period.

Positions:

$105 Calls for April or June. Make it cheaper if you want by selling the $125 or $130s

herrtm_SPG,SPG,Simon Property Group — most valuable retail real estate in the world at historically low prices,"Honest question for REIT investors: Is there anyone who can provide me with an argument against buying SPG that is not COVID related? I am a 24 year old investor and have a 5+ year time horizon. SPG owns the most valuable retail real estate in the world and their tenants were growing sales at 5% last year, so I don’t buy that e-commerce is a serious long term threat. Yes, out of date retailers will go under, but will be replaced by more modern tenants. SPG is transitioning their properties to mixed use to incorporate hotels, offices, and apartments to drive foot traffic. So yes, traditional malls are a thing of the past, but well located mixed use entertainment and retail destinations are the future. Unless you are a retiree desperate for income, I don’t see why a dividend cut should be worrisome. It’s really the financially responsible thing to do in this environment. The cut will be by 50% at the most, which stills offers a 6% yield. I have read all the bearish sentiment on SPG. And yet, I have not heard one good reason why SPG wouldn’t be back at pre-pandemic levels of $140 / share within two years. That’s honestly at a minimum, I think you could argue fair value is even higher than that. SPG owns exclusively Class A malls which are the highest quality out there. 

Buying here gives me a good chance at doubling my principle investment, plus at worst a 6% yield which I will reinvest until the price meaningfully recovers. I expect the dividend will recover to pre pandemic levels within two or three quarters as well, which would put the yield closer to 12% if bought at current prices. I already have a small position at the low $50 level and am thinking about adding heavily. Help me out, what am I missing?",2020-06-24,3,17

1) FED is making it clear that stock can only goes up and looking at the undervalue stock names, we have SPG with actual profit last earning and good dividends while it’s still in the low compare to the rest of this bubble market.

2) Company bankrupts, mall is doomed? Nope, when one retail closed, another will takes its place. SPG owns real estates and collecting rents, they don’t care who bankrupt and who thrive. You simply don’t lose if you own real estates in this country.

3) Last consumers report indicates an increase in retail spendings as many states open up and personally, the women in my household is so eager to get back to shopping at the mall and I believe mall traffic will be back sooner than we anticipate

What’s the best move for my options below?  For clarity, I already rolled my June strikes up and out to July/Oct to try and capture the June div while also moving the strike up and capturing a small credit.

Margin account: (would prefer to keep liquidity if possible)

13x SPG Jul 17, 20 $80 covered call 
5x SPG Oct 16, 20 $85 covered call 

Tfsa:
6* Jul 17, 20 $60 covered call 

RSP:
5* Oct 16, 20 $80 covered call


Should I roll any of these to capture credits or possibly move the strike price up?  Will my deep itm longer dated covered calls be called away for the June div?  If so, getting the max credits/strike by rolling would make sense but take the risk of tying up capital.  

Other notes:

I have double the put contracts on SPG in case we dip for June/Jul.  if it extends, I would require downside protection in my margin account.  I would also like to hold some as a long term core position.

Thoughts? I’m sure lots of people are in this position with the crazy rally.  Thanks for the inputs and potential options for max cash.",2020-06-08,1,2

Calls on SPG. [9 contracts for SPG 70c 6/19](https://imgur.com/a/fJk5v6e) @ .81 and they are currently worth $19.30 (22.00 in afterhour)

Cashed out 4 of the contracts today to lock in $8000 profit and I plan to ride this out until at least end of next week, wish me luck.

ghqwbm_SPG,SPG,Today and tomorrow will be a big shake down of shopping mall REITs. $SKT $SPG,"Retail REITs are going to be hit HARD.  Simon (SPG) does earnings call tonight. Tanger (SKT) tomorrow.  Neither of these are technically penny stocks, but I expect Tanger to go there tomorrow (it's at about $6.50 at the moment).

I'm holding 100 SKT at $4.50.   Here's the DD on it....

The good:
Tanger is VERY conservative, and keeps a good balance sheet. They don't take huge risks, and typically have a bunch of cash reserves.  They are exclusively outlet malls.  Discount stores do better when times are bad. Them ladies need to shop, but they try and save money.  

Tanger prides itself on always paying a dividend. Come hell or high water, they'll pay.

Simon Properties are the big kid on the block. Tanger just nabbed the CEO of Simon to be their president/CEO.  That's like Shasta cola nabbing the CEO of Coke.

The bad:
It's retail. Nuff said.  Also, some major brands are going bankrupt, so they will lose tenants.  

The ugly:
They'll most likely announce record losses since they've been shut down.  Even if all the stores have paid rent sitting Covid-19 shutdown (probably haven't) they'll lose money.  Malls owners collect a base rent and then a percentage of sales.  They'll lose that percentage.

New CEO *could* be great news, or really bad. Depends on what he does.

My money is on Simon buying Tanger, but not in the near future, since they just bought someone else and are getting hammered with Covid.  

Whatever SPG announces will be a big tell as to what SKT will announce tomorrow.",2020-05-11,8,5

ga032h_SPG,SPG,"Looking into buying REITs like SPG, VTR, EPR. Should I wait until earnings for a possible dip or buy before they get too high?","I've been watching these three ""expensive"" REITs for a while and in the last few days they've been going up. I want to catch there before they being a total recovery (especially SPG). I know it's basically impossible to time stocks, but does anyone have any opinions on buying these?

Should I wait until their May earnings or buy them NOW before they continue to rise to expensive prices back to normal? I wanna buy the next dip or at least at a lower price.. But I'm a bit of a nooby when it comes to real estate lol.

fr04rj_SPG,SPG,Let's Talk About Simon Property Group (SPG),"SPG is one of the largest REITs in the world and owns roughly 200 malls, many of which are considered high-quality.  Most, but not all, of these commercial properties are based in the US.  SPG make money by renting out space in the malls.  While some may say retail is dead, SPG has done fairly well, increasing revenue by over 25% and nearly doubling profitability over the past 10 years.  SPG is not in a dying industry and likely will continue to generate cash into the far future, assuming they can avoid bankruptcy in the near future.

On 10 Feb SPG announced they would acquire an 80% stake in another REIT owning high-quality malls, Taubman Centers (TCO).  This will cost them approximately $3.6 billion in cash, leaving $2.4 bn available under their credit facilities.

On 18 March SPG closed all of their malls to slow the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus).  As of 31 Dec 19 SPG had $6.0 billion available under its credit facilities.

In the past year, SPG had 5.8 bn in revenues and 2.9 bn in FCF.  Assuming a similar level of expenditure while closed, it costs them  about 2.9 bn/year or $220 mil per month to remain closed with 0 revenue.  SPG will probably allow tenants to defer rent or waive rent entirely in order to avoid ugly evictions.  Keeping tenants, even tenants paying 0 rent, is desirable to SPG in order to maintain the network effect that draws customers into their malls.

In the very worst case scenario, where SPG keeps all malls closed, reimburses their tenants all rent, consummates the deal with TCO at the full price of $3.6 bn, and is unable to secure any new credit, they will still be able to remain solvent for almost 11 months.

The current price of SPG is 58.17, with a market cap of $18 bn.  The average of the last 10 years' FCF is around 21 bn, meaning SPG is trading around 9x its average FCF and around 7x last years' FCF.  

SPG was trading around 20x FCF prior to the recent pandemic.  Currently shares can be had for a 2/3 discount.

Am I missing anything or is SPG an extremely good bargain at today's prices?",2020-03-29,74,78
