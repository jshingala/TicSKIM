1kx39g9_UPS,UPS,$SPY Breakout or Fakeout? Key Levels and Indicators to Watch Into June,"Wanted to share this $SPY daily chart and get your take. We’re at a potentially critical technical spot, and several indicators are worth paying attention to. Here's a breakdown:

# Chart Overview

* **Ticker:** SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
* **Timeframe:** 1 Year Daily
* **Price as of 6/20/25:** $613.97 (up 2.08% on the day)
* **Indicators Used:**
   * Keltner Channels
   * RSI (14)
   * Momentum SMA (28)
   * MACD Histogram (12, 26, 9)

# Technical Breakdown

**Triangle Formation:**  
Price has been in a steady uptrend since the March low and is now nearing the apex of a symmetrical triangle. This was drawn using descending resistance from the January highs and ascending support from the April breakout. A move out of this pattern is likely soon.

**RSI at 62.77:**  
Still in bullish territory but not yet overbought. This leaves room for further upside, but we’re getting closer to the 70 level where pullbacks often occur.

**Momentum SMA at 53.54:**  
Momentum has been strong but recently started to curl down. Still well above the zero line, suggesting buyers are still in control for now, but a shift may be brewing.

**MACD Histogram Positive but Fading:**  
We’re still seeing green on the histogram, but the bars are shrinking. This is often a sign of slowing bullish momentum, which aligns with the idea that a decision point is near.

# Key Levels to Watch

* **Resistance:** \~$615 — the triangle’s upper boundary and recent highs.
* **Support:** \~$575 — the lower trendline.
* **Secondary support:** \~$540 — previous consolidation zone.

# Summary

SPY is pressing up against a major resistance level with momentum and RSI still favoring bulls. If it breaks through with volume, it could trigger a run toward 630–640. If not, a pullback to the 575 range would be a healthy reset. The next couple of sessions could set the tone going into July.

1kwsw4e_SPY,SPY,Daily SPY Plan - 5/13,"
Hey folks! Here’s the game plan for SPY today. Be mindful of risk, manage your contracts wisely, and don’t chase entries—wait for clean setups.

CALLS
Looking at 589c on a confirmed break of 589.27 resistance.

PT1: 590.48

PT2: 591.53

PT3: 592.52

SL/AVG: 588.38


PUTS
585p on a confirmed break below 584.91 support.

PT1: 583.34

PT2: 582.51

PT3: 580.83

SL/AVG: 586.25


These levels are ideal for scalping or day trading. 0DTE works, but personally I recommend contracts with a bit more time better flexibility and risk control.

SPY Gaps to Watch:

Above: 593.69–595.31

Below: 585.10–579.06, 571.13–565.15, 518.32–516.09, 477.21–476.74, 453.26–453.01, 412.40–410.45, 397.86–396.69, 382.11–381.08, 359.99–356.68, 347.27–344.44


Look for bounces and rejections at key levels, they can be just as profitable as breakouts. Adjust your expiry based on how late it is in the session. I switch to 1DTE+ as the day goes on.


Let’s stay sharp and trade smart!

Higher open is not high risk, is high win rate

SPY directly jumped to stand on the former high of 585, the gap above the take good, dense liquidity of the disk, no hesitation to sweep in.

The disk is clean, the main force does not cover up

The second minute there is 2 times the average volume put in, VWAP stick bottom pop, this is the main force control, with the mood to do unilateral.

Theta doesn't care about me.

Today is the expiration date, but I just want to eat the opening of that volatility, I'm not betting on the direction, I'm grabbing the rhythm.

It's not luck, it's system + execution:

 Technical: Gap above 585, confirming jump breakout

 Sentiment: the mood of the board shares warmed up, the index has the opportunity to follow the trend

 Strategy: only do the first wave of the opening, eat the end of the flash, never love war

  
One sentence summary:

High opening is not a pit, is the opportunity, but the key is you can not understand “who is active, who is in control of the disk”.

Today's wave is the classic emotional push up + institutions with the sweeping single, the rhythm is clean and sharp, do the brother of the day today not rush really a pity.

1kwxz52_NET,NET,SPY Call Options Trade — 116.6% Daily Return,"Today, I’m reviewing a recent SPY options trade. This trade achieved a 116.62% return, generating a profit of $3,539.78. Here’s a breakdown of the process and my thought process:

Trade Details
Underlying Asset: SPY Call Option

Strike Price: 589

Buy Time: 10:51

Purchase Price: $0.60 × 25 contracts = $1,500 (total cost)

Sell Time: 14:40

Sell Price: $2.03 × 25 contracts = $5,075 (total proceeds)

Net Profit: $5,075 - $1,500 = $3,575 (around $3,539.78 after fees)

Return on Investment: 116.6%

Market Context
The current market is highly volatile. As an ETF tracking the S&P 500 Index, SPY is influenced by various factors, including macroeconomic data, corporate earnings seasons, and Federal Reserve monetary policy expectations. Recent economic data has been mixed, and corporate earnings results have been inconsistent, leading to significant market sentiment fluctuations. The heightened implied volatility of options presented an opportunity for this trade.

Trading Logic
Strike Price Selection
The 589 strike price was chosen based on an expectation of short-term upward movement in the S&P 500 Index. This strike price fell within a reasonable range of being either in-the-money or out-of-the-money, offering a good balance between the probability of profit and cost control.

Entry Timing
After observing market sentiment and key indicators (such as trading volume, sector performance, and economic data releases) during the morning session, I judged that there was upward momentum and entered the trade at 10:51.

Exit Strategy
When the option price reached my target level during the late afternoon, I exited the position at 14:40 to lock in profits, avoiding potential pullbacks from market volatility.

Reflections and Suggestions
Options are high-risk, high-reward trading tools. While they can provide opportunities for quick profits, accurately assessing market trends is crucial. A misjudgment can result in losing the entire premium. Therefore, setting clear stop-loss and take-profit levels and aligning trades with your risk tolerance is essential for effective options trading.

Risk Disclaimer
This review is for sharing purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Options trading carries extremely high risk and may result in the loss of the entire premium. Please trade cautiously based on your risk capacity.

Discussion

The 589 strike price was chosen based on an expectation of short-term upward movement in the S&P 500 Index. This strike price fell within a reasonable range of being either in-the-money or out-of-the-money, offering a good balance between the probability of profit and cost control.

Entry Timing
After observing market sentiment and key indicators (such as trading volume, sector performance, and economic data releases) during the morning session, I judged that there was upward momentum and entered the trade at 10:51.

Exit Strategy
When the option price reached my target level during the late afternoon, I exited the position at 14:40 to lock in profits, avoiding potential pullbacks from market volatility.

Reflections and Suggestions
Options are high-risk, high-reward trading tools. While they can provide opportunities for quick profits, accurately assessing market trends is crucial. A misjudgment can result in losing the entire premium. Therefore, setting clear stop-loss and take-profit levels and aligning trades with your risk tolerance is essential for effective options trading.

Risk Disclaimer
This review is for sharing purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Options trading carries extremely high risk and may result in the loss of the entire premium. Please trade cautiously based on your risk capacity.

1kwqw2n_NET,NET,"SPY opens high to grab money - I made a real profit of $4,748 with 50 586C shares in the morning session. Technique and rhythm are the key","SPY opened higher today (May 27th), giving me a direct opportunity. I set my sights on 586 Call before the market opened. At 09:48 in the morning, I bought 50 shares of SPY 586C@ at market price at $1.44, with a total cost of $7,200. The market rose instantly.

Higher open is not high risk, is high win rate

SPY directly jumped to stand on the former high of 585, the gap above the take good, dense liquidity of the disk, no hesitation to sweep in.

The disk is clean, the main force does not cover up

The second minute there is 2 times the average volume put in, VWAP stick bottom pop, this is the main force control, with the mood to do unilateral.

Theta doesn't care about me.

Today is the expiration date, but I just want to eat the opening of that volatility, I'm not betting on the direction, I'm grabbing the rhythm.

It's not luck, it's system + execution:

 Technical: Gap above 585, confirming jump breakout

 Sentiment: the mood of the board shares warmed up, the index has the opportunity to follow the trend

 Strategy: only do the first wave of the opening, eat the end of the flash, never love war

  
One sentence summary:

High opening is not a pit, is the opportunity, but the key is you can not understand “who is active, who is in control of the disk”.

Today's wave is the classic emotional push up + institutions with the sweeping single, the rhythm is clean and sharp, do the brother of the day today not rush really a pity.

1ku2ad9_SPY,SPY,Large Odd SPY Options Play,"I might be fully regarded. Actually I am. I was doing some basic research as one does trying to improve their plays. I came across something strange and I can't quite figure it out. This might be long so bear with me. I was doing some analytics on the calls/puts volume spikes versus price movements using pandas, matplotlib, and polygon.io. Everything looks pretty normal, the price movement correlates with the call/put spikes in volume except for 5/21. There is a massive spike with no price movement and it was in the middle of the day

Now if I isolate what options correspond to those spikes I get the following:

O:SPY250523P00582000: 2833  
O:SPY250523C00585000: 2704

I noticed this SPY 6/30 P 475 70000 contracts, SPY 6/30 P 440 35000 contracts, SPY 6/30 P 510 35000 contracts all sold at the same time in those exact increments way OTM. Very different than the other plays ITM or near ITM. I looked at the options charts for these contracts at the time of purchase (shows volume spike as well) the 440 strike was .30 premium, 475 strike was .53 premium, 510 strike was 1.11 premium. I think I am reading the chart correctly but it looks like sold 35,000 440-strike, bought 70,000 475-strike, and bought 35,000 510-strike. If this is the case 3,885,000 + 3,710,000 - 1,050,000 = $6,545,000.

Now I am trying to understand what the play is here. From what I can find this is called a put ratio backspread. If I am correct on the sold vs bought then SPY would need to fall below $510 by 6/30 to breakeven. SPY at 500 is 28M profit, 490 is 63M profit. (if this is a pure speculation play)

This is a smart play, not your average regard; the trade carries negative theta (two long puts for every one sold) but long vega to cushion the daily bleed. Why would someone risk 6.5M on this play? Someone expects spy to crash hard in the next few months?

Can someone shine some light here? Anything I am missing? This seems to be an incredibly expensive ""bet"" that is very all or nothing; unless someone knows something we dont. This might pertain to the tariffs but the 90 day pause ends 7/9, the contracts expire before then. Could also just be a hedge play for risk management.

What might they be trying to accomplish? What pieces of the puzzle are we still missing? Are they hedging 7 million shares of SPY? Is there some event they expect before 6/30?

TLDR:  
Found huge options play for SPY 70,000 contracts at 475 strike; 35,000 contracts at 440 strike; 35,000 contracts at 510 strike. This is a very strong bearish view whether its a pure speculative bet or risk management play. Without knowing what else they hold (shares, futures, calls, other expirations) or why they picked June 30.

Final question: Is this one of you regards and what dont we know? And what plays should be made off this if any?

Edit:

I ran April and May: this appears to be a large hedge play. Same trends 70,000, 35,000, 35,000. Repeat 1:2:1, consistent widths 30-35 widths, same execution time. This must be programmatic tail-risk hedging. Probably nothing in the end. Still very interesting. ",2025-05-24,48,15

**📈 Treasury Yields Surge Amid Weak Bond Auction**

U.S. Treasury yields continued their upward trajectory, with the 10-year yield nearing 4.6% and the 30-year yield surpassing 5%, marking the highest levels since early 2023. This increase followed a weak $16 billion auction of 20-year bonds, which attracted less investor demand and sold at higher-than-expected yields. Factors contributing to the rise include fading recession fears, persistent inflation concerns, and growing fiscal worries related to potential tax cut extensions.

**📉 Stock Market Declines as Tech Stocks Retreat**

The stock market experienced significant losses, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1.9%, falling below its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Technology stocks, including Nvidia ($NVDA), Broadcom ($AVGO), and Palantir ($PLTR), reversed gains and declined sharply amid renewed AI chip restrictions and rising Treasury yields.

**💼 Snowflake ($SNOW) Reports Strong Earnings**

Snowflake Inc. reported record quarterly revenue of $1.04 billion, surpassing expectations. Product revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $996.8 million. The company raised its full-year forecast to $4.325 billion, reflecting a 25% year-over-year increase. Despite a GAAP net loss of $430 million, Snowflake posted an adjusted profit of 24 cents per share, exceeding the 21-cent estimate.

**📊 Morgan Stanley Turns Bullish on U.S. Stocks**

Morgan Stanley has shifted to a bullish stance on U.S. stocks and bonds, raising its outlook due to signs of market stabilization and improving growth conditions. Strategists suggest that the worst is over for equities, citing a rolling earnings recession over the past three years that sets the stage for recovery. The bank maintains a base target of 6,500 for the S&P 500 by mid-2026, with a bullish scenario projecting 7,200.

1kre1dh_SPY,SPY,SPY 593P Intraday Double Live Trading Review - Technical + Emotional Resonance for Precise Strikes,"Today (May 20), I made a fast-entry, fast-exit, high-winning intraday trade, 54 SPY 593P, built a position from mid-early morning, and then sold it precisely in the late afternoon when sentiment accelerated, for a total profit of $6,099.91, which is a doubling of my gains. Below is my trade logic and execution details to share with you day trading brothers:

Strategy Front - Why Eye on SPY PUT?

Macro: Market sentiment has wavered in recent days, with the Panic Indicator (VIX) showing intraday movement and US bond yields continuing to move higher, while the market is clearly lacking in follow-through momentum at higher levels.

Technicals:

The SPY failed multiple tests near 600 to form a localized double top.

The 15-minute level broke below EMA 9 / EMA 21, and the MACD dead cross was confirmed.

After many days of high consolidation, today's morning open directly jumped below the support, there is a demand for shorting.

Time to buy - 11:56 AM, technical signals + intraday resonance

I observed that SPY was unable to rally, volume continued to shrink, at the same time, large order Put started to sweep orders quickly, immediately opened a position of 54 593P at $1.11, close to low absorption.

Basis for position building:

Timing weak sideways, obvious signs of attracting more.

Tracking the option chain, 593P IV began to raise its head, active buying.

The index did not show any signs of resistance, and at the same time broke down the pre-midday consolidation range.

Sell point - 15:08 PM, take profit at extreme sentiment release point

Before the end of the day began, I observed SPY accelerated downward smashing on volume, options quickly pulled up, the $2.25 limit order I set was instantly eaten up, all sold, and successfully bagged.

Summary - Discipline + Sentiment = Intraday Meat

The core of this order to eat double profits is still:

Advance market direction + technical confirmation

Waiting for the best opportunity to get in and out of the market with strict discipline

Do not be greedy at the end of the day, cash profits in a timely manner

  
The trades were non-fictional throughout and the goal was not to show off, but to review + document in the hopes of inspiring those who are still figuring out the rhythm of intraday trading.

If you also made today's SPY short order, welcome to leave a comment to discuss the strategy together.

1kpyt7n_SPY,SPY,Need Help Understanding My SPY $605 Call Position (Exp 6/30),"Hi everyone,

I’m down over 58% on this position and trying to understand what my best course of action is. I bought these 7 contracts back in January when SPY was much lower, expecting a big move. There was a nice bounce today (+20% daily return), but I’m still significantly in the red overall.

Questions:
	1.	With SPY currently at $588, is there a realistic chance this position becomes profitable by expiration?
	2.	How much does the relatively low IV (12.72%) affect my premium decay?
	3.	Would it make sense to roll this position to a further out expiry or lower strike?
	4.	Should I just cut losses now given how far OTM I still am?

Any insights, especially around how to better manage trades like this next time (entry timing, strike selection), would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

So lets say the price hits a key support or resistance level and the indicators point to a big pump or big dump. Would it be practical to 

1. Place  a call and a put in at the same time.

2. 

a: if it breaks up(with strong volume), sell the put

b: if it breaks down(with strong volume), sell the call. 

3. Then ride the winner until hitting a solid profit percent.

Would this be a decent strategy to mitigate losses and maximize profit? ",2025-05-19,1,4

1kpa2jq_SPY,SPY,"Day trading SPY/ES/MES: Traders, please criticise my trades.","Preface: This is a rather long post. I'm NOT A PROFITABLE TRADER. I'm just looking for feedback on my trades, and advice to how I can be better.

Background: I have been trading stocks for around 3 years, swing and day trade. I have never been consistently profitable. I have made all the mistakes a novice trade would make. Overtrading, Strategy hoping, Holding onto losers, you name it. Good thing, I'm paper trading.

Earlier this year, I decided to try to stick to day trading SPY 0DTE only (after 1pm I switch to next day expiration to avoid time decay). No swing, just day trade. I don't like going to sleep wanting the market to open the next day so I can watch my swing positions. I was GAMBLING, a lot. Up until the 1st week of MAY, I made 412 trades. That's 100 trades a month in average. All journaled, entry, exit, time, setup, psychology. Out of 4 months, I had 2 profitable weeks. 1 of them being during Trump tariffs talk, where I had a gigantic win compared to my losses. Again, gamble.

My strategy: I look at the M5 chart for trend. I use Heikin Ashi candles to confirm the trend. As soon as there is a flat bottom (bullish) or flat top (bearish HA) candles, I switch to the M1, looking for a pull back to 15EMA. I enter as soon as price touches 15EMA. Stop loss is where I feel like the trade is not going my way, or losses are too big to handle. Target profit is also mental, no hard rules, often where I see 2 3 green candles on a M1 chart.

I looked at my journal, good thing I have a sample of 400 trades, made a list of mistakes, then what I have to change.

1. Over trading: You know, HA candles can be flat top/bottom many times a day, even when stock is just chopping around. I can't rely on only HA candles to determine the trend.
2. Cut winner short, Let losers run: No need to explain here.
3. Price action: Most of my losing trades are taken when SPY is chopping around, no clear direction. Small candles, wicks, tails, red, green all over the place.
4. Many times SPY just blows right through the 15EMA without even looking back, so taking a trade the moment it hits the 15EMA is just risky.
5. This is personal. 0DTE decays too fast, and IBKR paper trading options is no good. I switched to MES.

Knowing this, I have refined my strategy into the following:

**Trade with the trend:** I watch for an HA candle on the M5. Bullish if M5 above 15EMA, bearish if below. The price action on the M5 has to be either grinding in 1 direction, a long, fat candle or stacked candles with small wicks. I don't care if it has moved $15 during the day, I will join the trend. If there's a setup, I will take it. No counter trend.

**Looking for an entry:** I switch to M1 to see if the price action on the M1 is tradeable. Again, stacked candles with small wicks, or nice orderly candles with little retracement. Then, I will wait for stock to pull back to the 15EMA. I want the pull back to be weak too. I don't want to see a giant candle blowing right through the 15EMA. Then I wait for a MEANINGFUL bounce off the 15EMA. If I'm bullish, I want the candle to bounce off the 15EMA right away, and close above it.

**SL/TP:** SL is the low of the candle that violates the 15 EMA. TP: 15 points /MES. After entering the trade, I walk away, do something else. I let the market decide if I win or lose.

I took 6 trades the week of 12MAY25.  
3 wins - Plus 44.75 pts total  
3 losses -  Minus 10 pts total

Pros: I don't feel like gambling. Less stress on my mental health. After opening my trade, I don't have to deal with my heart beating fast, deciding where to enter/exit. 

Cons: I feel really bored. I don't feel like I'm working and wasting my time just watching. I'm a workaholic, I want to be constantly doing something.

1kp3kvk_SPY,SPY,Interpretation of unusual put activity? SPY Put/call ratio 4.26 June13 max pain $580,"[https://www.maximum-pain.com/options/spy](https://www.maximum-pain.com/options/spy)

When you examine the usual put/call ratio of late, they hover around 1-2 ish. However for June13th it's spikes to 4.26. 

On the broad market, we can see fear and greed index at 71.

[https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed](https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed)

Indicating a high level of greed bouncing up by 50pts towards greed after the despair in April. 

In terms of fundamentals, AI analysis from Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT, Perplexity and DeepSeek thought of the possible catalyst for the activity. 

* **Inflation Data:** The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is scheduled for release on June 11, 2025, and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on June 12, 2025. Higher-than-expected inflation could lead to concerns about more aggressive Federal Reserve policies, potentially triggering a market sell-off.
* **Federal Reserve (FOMC) Anticipation:** An FOMC interest rate decision is scheduled for June 18, 2025. The days leading up to this meeting could see increased put buying as traders position themselves for potential hawkish surprises or increased volatility.
* **Consumer Sentiment and Inflation Expectations:** Preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment and Inflation Expectations data are due on June 13, 2025. Weak consumer sentiment or heightened inflation expectations could negatively impact the market.
* **Other Economic Indicators:** Weekly Unemployment Claims (June 12) and the Treasury Currency Report (June 13) can also influence market sentiment.

Here's me wondering if people are just hedging for the bad economic data, which we know for sure is coming or is there something bigger coming. 

Last time we saw something out of the norm like this it lead to the fuckening that is the last month.

I don't know if you all feel the same way, but today's price action was brutal. There was no clear trend, and both calls and puts were smashed in early trading.

What surprised me was how well one of my setups held up even in such a noisy environment. I wasn't expecting much, but sticking with the idea made all the difference.

1kochh0_SPY,SPY,"Great Risk Management, Terrible Trade Strategy $SPY Daily","Feel like I have the opposite problem that everyone else has in this subreddit.  I have never decided to hold onto a position because I believed there would be more gains, once the stock hits my stop loss or take profit point I always sell.

I trade daily on the $SPY and depending on the volatility for the day my take profits and stop losses are increments of 8%, 12% and 16% respectively, and I always stick to them, but every time I decide to enter into a position, I always end up being wrong, and then the times that I decide to just inverse what I am thinking since I am always wrong I end up losing out again.  I once went on a 12 day streak where I was making consistent gains, but since then I have failed to recapture that momentum and have been down consistently since the end of April.  For context I started out with a lump sum of $5,000 that turned into $8,000 but has again dwindled to around $4,500.  I was not using a trade strategy to make my gains to $8,000.  I thought I had a strategy but looking back I was going with my gut.

My question is to anyone out there that does the daily $SPY swing trading that I chose to do, do you have any pointers? I am great at keeping my emotions in check, but I think my 64 IQ is inhibiting me from coming up with any consistent trade strategies.",2025-05-16,1,2

1ko7697_SPY,SPY,A 35% gain in one go - Precise 0DTE operation targeting SPY,"Brothers, I've been keeping an eye on SPY since early this morning. The market trend tells me that this round is about ""luring liquidity"" by the funds. Although the time value decay of 0DTE is ruthless, the flow of funds during the trading session is clearly biased towards the long side.

I didn't rush to enter the market. Around noon, I noticed that SPY was stuck in a tight range between 589 and 590, and the volume of the call options for 591 began to pile up. At that moment, I knew a small rally was coming.

I bought 54 591-day-expiring SPY call options at an average price of around $1.27.

The goal is clear: Take advantage of this wave of liquidity, don't get greedy, and make your profits and then move on.

Set the selling price at: $1.74. Absolutely no waiting until the end of the trading session to speculate on the market trend.

13:08 Limit order executed, all positions closed. Total profit: $2,481.91, yield rate: 35.9%. The battle was resolved in less than an hour. No FOMO, no hesitation like ""Should we wait a little longer?"" - executed according to the plan.

To be honest, this is not luck; it's the result of the strict operational discipline of 0DTE. A precise and targeted transaction, not a haphazard and random one.

The 0DTE option of SPY does carry extremely high risks. However, if you can understand the market price, comprehend the time value and volatility, and know when to exit, then it becomes the most powerful tool in your account.

1knzbxa_SPY,SPY,SPY May 23 Options Flow Highlights: Key Levels Forming at $580–$600,"SPY is currently trading at $590.46, and May 23 flow shows both bullish and bearish pressure building — great for range traders and breakout watchers.

⸻

Top CALL Clusters:
	•	$600C: 16.4K vol | 15.1K OI → strong resistance wall
	•	$590C: 12.6K vol | 10.1K OI → price magnet/short-term pin level
	•	$605C: 11.5K vol | 8.9K OI → breakout bet zone

Top PUT Clusters:
	•	$580P: 17.7K vol | 18.5K OI → strong support floor
	•	$585P: 14.2K vol | 6.8K OI → mid-level defense
	•	$575P: 10.8K vol | 12.3K OI → downside hedge anchor

⸻

Flow Takeaway (For Traders):
	•	$585–$600 is the current battlefield.
	•	If SPY holds above $585, bulls may push for $595–600 test by Friday.
	•	A crack below $580, especially with rising put volume, opens the door for a retrace to $575 or lower.

⸻

Trade Ideas:
	•	Straddle/strangle if you expect a move but unsure of direction.
	•	Call spreads if leaning bullish toward $595–600.
	•	Put debit spread if betting on a breakdown through $580.

1kndywu_SPY,SPY,SPY Spread Math,"So I'm looking to do my first spread on SPY which is currently trading at about $590 per share on May 15th 2025.

If today I wanted to buy and sell contracts that expire tomorrow on May 16th 2025... And there is a $601 strike call that has a ASK price of $0.12 per share.... And a $600 strike call selling for a BID price $0.16 per share..... Then I will ""make"" four cents per share off the premiums or basically $4 right? 

Considering that if by the end of the trading day tomorrow the stock price stays underneath both strikes? 

Because now my question is why not do this with about 48 hours ahead of time and buy and sell 100 contracts at a time so long as spy has the volume and liquidity to get all the contract orders filled? 

From my understanding, since there is a $1 difference in the strike prices my max loss is $1 per share minus the premium that I will collect.... So since I collected four cents per share off the premium spread... Then won't my broker require me to have 96 cents per share in my brokerage account? 

Basically $96 in my brokerage account per trade that I make by buying a call and selling one? 

This seems too easy to me, so of course I'm cautious and I came here to ask

Any adv would be super appreciated, thank you ",2025-05-15,3,28

I am wondering for those who are familiar with ORB and scalp QQQ/SPY, how do you decide on your entries? 

I have been looking for volume on one minute candles or retesting of VWAP, Highs, or Lows. It's usually very difficult because the volume quickly fades when moving between levels and the volume usually only last for a candle or two. Then as soon as there is breakdown or breakout, candles just cross the high/lows.

Is it because SPY/QQQ are aggregates of stock? 

More details: I use Robinhood legend. My indicators are volume, VWAP, RSI and I draw premarket highs and lows, previous day highs and lows, and 30 minute ORB.

1kl9fet_V,V,Spy vs MES accuracey,"So I've been experimenting and day trading for the last 4 years with SPY and MES switching back and forth from futures to options and seeing which one I found my edge in. So far I found my edge in SPY using the 1-minute combined with the 5-minute, 1h support and resistance and combining the 13, 50 and 200 EMA. So what I do is I look at 5 min at open for immidiate direction and pullback/ main trend and use the 1 min to escape clusters of emas or levels into an area that is mostly just empty space and ride it to the next major level which could be a strong ema or a key level.

I've noticed however that sometimes expecially on the 1 min the 200 ema lags or is in a different spot than MES. I ran data thru GPT and it says MES is more accurate when watching price action and that most pros watch MES to enter spy options anyways . I usually use spy chart to enter but am thinking of using MES chart to enter trades. I've heard this is the way to go but I don't want to fix something that isn't broken? Anyone do this or had good results switching charts? To my knowledge MES leads and looking at the charts looks more reliable. But like I said I have a good system going for me with spy, but am willing to get better.",2025-05-13,1,5

1kje1pl_SPY,SPY,Large $SPY buzzer beater calls at the close yesterday,,2025-05-10,103,42
1kithya_UPS,UPS,300x SPY Bear Call Spread into the Trade Deal Hopium — Charging $3.25. Free Money?,"SPY’s been ripping lately from its lows on “trade deals” and general hopium. Latest one? UK. media made it seem like a big deal, but that’s not moving markets. Plus, that's an ally. Easier to get a trade deal done there than with other trading partners.

China is the main one that matters. And I don't think we’re anywhere close.

Markets have been pumping on this weekend's meeting with China, and this is how I think the news will go on Monday: Trump says, “The deal went great.” — Xi comes out a day later and says, “We're not even close.”  

All in all, the leading player who's been flinching and going back on their word is the orange man and his crew. XI's been set in stone, while Trump's flinching with either bond yields rising, markets collapsing, negative remarks from big Wall Street players, etc, etc..

Most Recent Trump talks tough (145% tariffs), then backs off (80%), then says they’re negotiating (BTW 145% and 80% is the same thing in terms of trade - people are importing anything with either). This cycle’s been repeating. Xi isn’t blinking. We are.

So here’s what I did:

* **Sold 300 SPY 605C 9/30/25 @ 10.74**
* **Bought 300 SPY 615C 9/30/25 @ 7.49**

Total credit: **$3.25 or $97,500**

SPY’s at **564**

Break-even at **608.25** → That’s a **7.8% move up**

Max loss if SPY rips above **615 around a 9% move up**

# Thesis:

* Trade deal with China breaks down (again) next week
* No way we rally another 8–10% with macro headwinds
* Market already priced in “good outcome,” there’s too much downside from here
* We don’t touch February’s high again anytime soon

**Risk:**

* CPI tanks → Fed starts signaling cuts
* Tech earnings beat hard
* Or Xi caves (not likely)

If we go higher and break SPY ATH, im cooked. But I like the odds. Ill take a 2 to 1 risk reqard any day of the week.

**TL;DR**

Charged $3.25 for 300x bear call spread.

SPY needs to break ATH for me to get burnt. Way to many hurdles in its path, main one being a China deal.

If we chop or fade on another China fake-out, I’m walking with 6 figures.

Market Sentiment (MS): The recent U.S.-U.K. trade deal and upcoming discussions between the U.S. and China have created a positive outlook, increasing investor sentiment. Based on these developments, I assess MS as 0.7 (moderately bullish). 2. Market Performance Factor (MPF): Previous close of SPY (561.15) and the open (565.24) indicates a gain. Calculation: (565.24 - 561.15) / 561.15 = 0.0073 or 0.73% gain. This is a bullish signal leading to an MPF score of 0.6. 3. Technical Analysis Score (TAS): Relative to indicators, the current SPY price (565.06) is above VWAP (average price). The RSI is at 54.29, indicating positive momentum. Calculation includes those factors yielding a TAS of 0.61. 4. Options Market Analysis (OMA): The put/call volume ratio is close to 1, with higher call volumes at 1212476 compared to put volumes at 908427. A weighted assessment gives OMA a score of 0.55. 5. Historical Data Analysis (HDA): Given the market's bullish trend and positive external factors recently observed, HDA is set at 0.65. 6. Bayesian Probability Factor (BPF): With increasing volume and positive price velocity, I rate BPF as 0.6 as momentum appears to be in a bullish trend. 7. Hurst Exponent: Data is unavailable, rated as neutral at 0.5. 8. Mean Reversion Factor (MRF): The SPY is not significantly deviated from VWAP, suggesting mild overextension; rated MRF at 0.5. 9.

Scenario A:

You sell a weekly put on a stock, the next day it goes below your strike and you are going to get assigned at the end of the week.

You can buy to close your put to minimize downside, or you can sit on it and wait to get assigned. The price could go significantly lower than your strike because you have 4 days left on your contract, and if it does you're going to be WAY under water. By the time you get assigned, selling calls at your cost basis could net you basically nothing because price has dropped so far.

1kithya_PATH,PATH,300x SPY Bear Call Spread into the Trade Deal Hopium — Charging $3.25. Free Money?,"SPY’s been ripping lately from its lows on “trade deals” and general hopium. Latest one? UK. media made it seem like a big deal, but that’s not moving markets. Plus, that's an ally. Easier to get a trade deal done there than with other trading partners.

China is the main one that matters. And I don't think we’re anywhere close.

Markets have been pumping on this weekend's meeting with China, and this is how I think the news will go on Monday: Trump says, “The deal went great.” — Xi comes out a day later and says, “We're not even close.”  

All in all, the leading player who's been flinching and going back on their word is the orange man and his crew. XI's been set in stone, while Trump's flinching with either bond yields rising, markets collapsing, negative remarks from big Wall Street players, etc, etc..

Most Recent Trump talks tough (145% tariffs), then backs off (80%), then says they’re negotiating (BTW 145% and 80% is the same thing in terms of trade - people are importing anything with either). This cycle’s been repeating. Xi isn’t blinking. We are.

So here’s what I did:

* **Sold 300 SPY 605C 9/30/25 @ 10.74**
* **Bought 300 SPY 615C 9/30/25 @ 7.49**

Total credit: **$3.25 or $97,500**

SPY’s at **564**

Break-even at **608.25** → That’s a **7.8% move up**

Max loss if SPY rips above **615 around a 9% move up**

# Thesis:

* Trade deal with China breaks down (again) next week
* No way we rally another 8–10% with macro headwinds
* Market already priced in “good outcome,” there’s too much downside from here
* We don’t touch February’s high again anytime soon

**Risk:**

* CPI tanks → Fed starts signaling cuts
* Tech earnings beat hard
* Or Xi caves (not likely)

If we go higher and break SPY ATH, im cooked. But I like the odds. Ill take a 2 to 1 risk reqard any day of the week.

**TL;DR**

Charged $3.25 for 300x bear call spread.

SPY needs to break ATH for me to get burnt. Way to many hurdles in its path, main one being a China deal.

If we chop or fade on another China fake-out, I’m walking with 6 figures.

1khkfl3_NET,NET,"Another fomc, another loss day for buying SPY straddle (tho still positive over the last 10 fomcs!)","For context, I've been building an options backtesting framework that allows testing random strategies. the main idea is to take a more quantitative approach to trading by looking at historical events as a baseline before I place new bets.

Anyways, I was almost certain that buying and holding 0 dte straddles on FOMCs is a loser just given how elevated implied vol tends to be, and how there is so much pnl you would miss out on from intraday volatility by not doing dynamic hedging. 

Still the backtest result is fairly surprising and I thought it's worth sharing a few observations and lessons - 

**Observations:**

1. As expected, during FOMCS vol significantly under-realize relative to implied (often 50-80%; today it was down 60%; that's where you see the return is negative in the table)

2. However, if you bet 10K each time over the last 10 FOMCs, you would still make 10% return - just because the Dec 24 FOMC had a 464% return (I think that's when JPow was much more hawkish than expected)

From there, I think there are some very valuable lessons (esp. for newer options traders)

**Lessons:**

1. It's important to distinguish between the probability of making money and expected payout. e.g. in this case you are losing 80% of the days, but still your net pnl is positive. So those tail events can make up for your ""slow bleed"" when you are long vol (or break you when you are selling options). in fact straddle is expected to lose money more than 50% of time (the blog moontower has a good post about this; highly recommend)

2. Sizing really matters (partly because timing matters too and it's hard to control for that). I ran two simulations - the first one bets 10k each time, the other one bets 100% of 10k on the first run, and then bets with whatever is left repeatedly (i.e. compounded return). You can see in the second try, the strategy lost almost 100% of money halfway through. In fact, it doesn't even have enough capital to afford one straddle on Dec 2024, the day with 464% return.

**What's next**:

From here I'm probably gonna run some more specific simulations on buying straddle right before the statement or the presser, and selling 10-30 minutes after. This way the straddle can capture any big drifts immediately (which tends to be the case when JPow answers questions).

If anyone has other strategies you want to run / test, let me know and I can see if my framework can support it.

1kfptpr_UPS,UPS,SPY algo trading,"I saw a post from a dude who trades the last hour or so of SPY hours with the current trend. Ex: if the day has been mostly bearish he will play out the day bearish. He claims to have made decent money off of it but I’m not sure if he is telling the truth or not. Regardless it got me thinking.

How many studies are out there or models built that correlate the first half of the trading day for SPY or any other index and correlates it to the second half.

Such as if spy were to go up 1% in the first couple hours where would it historically finish. Same would go for a 3-5% range and 5%+ range and if the higher the percent daily change the more predictable the end result of the trading day could be. This could be done over any time frame of trading days.

I wonder if any correlation exists there and if it has already been done multiple times",2025-05-05,14,19

But I'm having a similar issue as the OP of identifying SPY's overall day's trend, but then entering too early and getting stopped out of the trade. I hadn't set a stop loss automatically in hope of (deadly phrase there) my option regaining value but then next thing I know, I'm down 20-30% and Im exiting. I'm using 0dte as I have small amount of capital (lost most after freezing during mango's shenanigans that send SPY rocketing). One person had mentioned entering where your stop is. I'm having a hard time visualizing that and was wondering if folks could elaborate on that strategy? I had previously focused on MACD + volume +breaking key pivot points. And more recently I added in RSI due to a similar issue as above. Trying to slowly regain value so that I can avoid risky 0dte and do longer. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!",2025-05-03,8,12

1kbit90_AAPL,AAPL,TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF,"Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as ""Musk stepping back from DOGE"", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.

But I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF.

I had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down.

So the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry—on days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.

The other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.

What's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a ""megacap"" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot—inflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.

The real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.

An important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)

EDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.

EDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.

1kb86q1_SPY,SPY,Iron Condor and Credit spreads on SPY,"Hi everyone.

I've learned a lot from reading posts on here, and I appreciate the community we have here. 

Here's my current situation: 

I'm hoping to supplement my Social Security with credit spreads on SPY so I can leave work.  (I'm 71 yrs old).  Here's what I'm planning to enter in a few weeks after I clear up some old trades: 

50 IRON CONDORS on SPY;   (+525p,-530p  -580c +585c) enter 45 days ahead.  At yesterday's vix of 26 today dropped to 24.5 today) Iron condor 50 of them for 11k cr max loss 13k.   Close in 21 days.  at 5k profit will be happy.

  
Because the deltas are higher, (I like to get at least $1 credit on a 5 pt spread) I want to use hedges.  Buy Vix calls as a hedge on the downside, and buy some 565-575 bull call vert spreads expiring at the 21 day mark rather than the initial 45 day expiration on the trade, which is when I'm planning on closing out the trade - (Tasty Trade methodology).  

This is the monthly trade I'm hoping to be my bread and butter, if VIX remains above 20.  If VIX goes below 20 I'd look at bull put spreads with a hedge  only until VIX goes back up. 

Thankful for any thoughts/opinions.  (I know I may need to roll or take some action on one of the sides).

1kbit90_PLTR,PLTR,TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF,"Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as ""Musk stepping back from DOGE"", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.

But I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF.

I had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down.

So the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry—on days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.

The other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.

What's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a ""megacap"" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot—inflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.

The real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.

An important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)

Does anyone know of any good free websites or apps that offer up-to-date news feeds—things like earnings report dates and times, PCE data, public commentary, trending topics, market sentiment, FOMO alerts, etc.?

I've been day trading for almost a year now. I was doing pretty well at first, but recently it's been a bit of a downturn. I'm using IBKR as my broker.

Sometimes I browse through Stocktwits for info, but honestly, it's tough—you have to sift through tons of noise before finding anything actually useful. And by that time, the opportunity has usually passed.

Chart - [Prospero.AI](http://Prospero.AI)

Here’s what’s interesting:

* Early April was pure pain. NOS was basically flatlined near zero while SPY nuked below 500. Options flow was super bearish or just nonexistent.
* Around mid-April though, sentiment started turning up. First slow, then a pretty decent spike.
* By April 22, NOS ripped through the “Bull Line” (around 40) and actually stayed up there for a few days.
* SPY’s price action caught up too — it’s been grinding up toward 550–560 ever since.



On top of that, you’ve got:

* Trump pausing some of the new tariffs (at least for now)
* Tech earnings coming in strong (Google especially crushed)
* Market sort of trying to price in a soft landing again
* So basically, the sentiment + price combo is finally showing some real strength for the first time in weeks.
* But (and it’s a big but), could just be a classic dead cat bounce too. We’ve seen fakeouts before.



If NOS starts rolling over from here, probably back to Chop City.

If it stays elevated or keeps pushing higher? Could actually be the start of a bigger leg up.

I’m not full send bullish yet but definitely watching this pretty closely now.

1k91htq_SPY,SPY,reasoning behind SPY 5/30 IV skew,"Here's two scatter plots showing the relationship between IV and strike price for both calls & puts , for the SPY 5/30 option chain ( 31 DTE ) . Im struggling to understand why the inflection point ( min point ) , of both IV skews is further away to the upside than the current spot price which is shown by the black line as around 550 ; around 590 for puts and 600 for calls.

From theory , the min point should be ATM due to these options having strikes being most likely where the stock will end up ,  more active trading volume meaning tighter bid-ask spreads , meaning more balanced order flows and again less uncertainty . So , if the actual min point is at a higher price, does that reflect a bullish trader sentiment , not only by traders buying options , but also by market makers selling options in their hedging strategies ? Or is this attribute frequently observed within SPY due to some reason im not aware of . ",2025-04-27,33,21

1k9bzaw_SPY,SPY,$SPY has 2 Scenarios playing,"[$SPY](https://x.com/search?q=%24SPY&src=cashtag_click) has 2 Scenarios playing that I can tell you now:  
  
Scenario 1: Immediate Rejection (High Probability)  
SPY is already inside the 535–550 short zone  
If rejected soon (around 552–555), price could:  
Roll back down toward 535 support  
Then if momentum accelerates, test 511–487 (0.5–0.618 retracement zones)  
This matches well with macro/astro cycles suggesting increased May volatility.  
  
Scenario 2: Trap and Pop (Low-to-Medium Probability)  
SPY fakes out above 555–560  
Pops toward 574–613, hitting the second short zone  
This traps late bulls and sets up a bigger and more violent reversal after May  
(This would match a false sense of relief rally into late May before major trouble hits.)  
  
535–550 zone = current battlefield  
If SPY climbs toward 574–613 — the RSI, MACD, and momentum indicators will be bearishly diverging, making it a perfect trap.  
  
Saturn, Mercury cycles point to May 6 – 9 window as an ideal reversal window if the second scenario happens.

1k9ddwz_SPY,SPY,SPY and using 2022 Lows for Fib levels,"Hello All:

Using the 2022 lows to draw fib levels on a weekly timeframe, we can see how the pullback over the last couple of months were respecting them. SPY hit .5 retracement at the $480 level. On Friday, SPY was bumping its head on the .236 retracement area of $551 where it had used it as support about 6 weeks prior. If the bottom is truly in, the $480 level may serve the ground floor of a new set of fib levels going forward.

A weekly candle formed above $551 this week would reinforce the idea of bullish continuation and heading to higher levels. We are still under key moving averages such as 50 Day EMA and 100/200 SMA but we are slowly making progress to regain key support levels.

Seriously, look at the timing. SPY is in a clear downtrend, and to break it technically we’d need a close above 563 this week. Suddenly, we’re getting headlines stacked like dominoes: Powell won’t be fired (after he just said he might), and tariffs on China will “substantially” come down.

* Powell safe
* Soft landing odds improving
* Q1 Earnings holding up

SPY $825 12/19 Call - 1500 buys

SPY $830 12/19 Call - 750 buys

MY ARGUMENT

I. The Setup No One Sees Coming

You’ve seen this before. Not the chart. The moment. A sharp drop. A confusing headline. Everyone bails. The algorithms freeze. And then, boom - the narrative flips, and everything rips. That’s the setup right now. SPY is down, volatility is up, and everyone’s arguing about tariffs like it’s Econ 101. But underneath that? A $0.14 option is hiding in plain sight. Deep OTM. December expiration. Sitting there like a scratcher ticket no one scratched. This isn’t a normal trade. It’s a cheap swing at a high conviction reversal. The kind of bet that looks dumb right before it doesn’t.

II. Trump Does What Trump Does

Trump negotiates like he’s writing headlines. Go big, go scary, then walk it back and declare victory with a simple tweet. It’s not theory — it’s his playbook: NAFTA, NATO, North Korea, China (round one). Every time: chaos first, deal later. Now he’s back, and he’s swinging tariffs again. The first shot was expected — China. But then he blindsided everyone by going after Canada and Mexico too. Europe followed. Suddenly it wasn’t just a trade policy. It was a global pile-on. But Trump always wants a win. And wins, for him, come fast. If he starts rolling back these tariffs - even if China stays frozen - the market doesn’t need a resolution. It just needs a direction.

III. What the Math Says

As of April 17, 2025, SPY closed at $526. The $760 call expiring December 19 is priced at $0.14. Using a projected mark of $678 and the same moneyness ratio (678/760), the equivalent August 15 strike is $590 and closed at $5.15. That $678 level isn’t fantasy. It’s the pre-tariff SPY close of $612 plus the same 10.8% gain SPY posted over the same stretch last year. At a cost of $0.14 and a value of $5.15, the return is 36x.

IV. The COVID Rebound: Redux

That 2020 move? Everyone remembers it. But instead of a deadly pandemic, it’s a tariff detour that will unwind - no vaccine required - by just two thumbs pecking out a tweet only one man on Earth can - “the tariff war is over - victory is in hand” - DJT. This isn’t a hedge. It’s a shot. A reset bounce puts this $0.14 option in the money with room to run. That’s not moonshot math. That’s just how mispricing works when everyone’s looking the other way. COVID showed us what happens when sentiment flips. This setup’s cheaper, simpler, and it doesn’t need a Fed bazooka or a warp speed cure— just a shift in tone and a headline worth chasing. If you missed out last time – now is your second chance.",2025-04-22,199,164
1k4k0dg_SPY,SPY,Far OTM on SPY expiring in 10days,"I am trying to just evaluate the risk on selling a far OTM put credit spread on SPY.

Current price SPY $510.

Strike price $400 expiring 02-May (11 days to expire) for a premium of about $15 a contract (10 contracts for a margin of about $6000 can get $150).

Considering SPY going to $400 is very unlikely in next 10 days (20% drop happened historically only 7 times with my backtest check), is it worth the trade? even if it drops so fast say to \~15%, could close the trade for a loss (when I check few days before expiry and \~5% to strike price premium is about $100/contract --> $500 loss in worst case which is also very unlikely event only as mentioned).

1k2knuz_F,F,SPY 60-day Backtest Results,"Hi everyone,

I just ran a super basic script backtesting the last 60 days of SPY price action with ORB logic executing trades. The details of the code can be found below, but the strategy is essentially 14-dte scalps that are 1% OTM following breakouts from the 15-minute close using the 5-minute timeframe to enter the trade. SL 3%, TP 6%. Keep in mind I have little experience coding and used LLMs (GPT and Colab's Gemini) to do the majority of the coding for me, so this is super rudimentary in both its design and assumptions. The results can be found below:

    --- Trade Summary ---
    Result
    Loss    35
    Win     24
    Open     1
    Name: count, dtype: int64
    
    Expected Value per Trade: 0.0065
    Win Rate: 40.00% | Loss Rate: 58.33%

If i'm understanding correctly, this would mean that in a 60-day trading period, my profit would be 24 x 0.06 - 35 x 0.03 = 39%. If I were to factor in commission fees, would the EV be high enough to end up in net profit?

1k2qfyv_SPY,SPY,How SPY moves in regarding to QQQ when it come to candle to canle movements.,"Sorry if this has been talked about but I have been scalping SPY for the past few month and has been generally successful, I have a very specific strategy to look at a very specific type of entry I want and when this condtion is meet I focus on the SPY canlde movement/volume to decide entry or not entry along with my SL.

  
Recently I been also looking at QQQ chart also at this specific entry location, I am getting some mixed results, sometimes I find the way candle move on QQQ can be a leading indicator when it come to volume as well as overall candle locations, but there are times I also feel like its a bit of lagging as well.

  
So exactly what is the underlying logic of how QQQ move vs SPY? I know both index have a big underlying of the same stocks and I know QQQ tend to move a lot more volatile with higher ranges... But im not sure exaclty how does it move? I mean like is QQQ literally just part of SPY? If you trade SPY or QQQ, do you use the other chart as a reference, if so how.",2025-04-19,1,5
1k2knuz_NET,NET,SPY 60-day Backtest Results,"Hi everyone,

I just ran a super basic script backtesting the last 60 days of SPY price action with ORB logic executing trades. The details of the code can be found below, but the strategy is essentially 14-dte scalps that are 1% OTM following breakouts from the 15-minute close using the 5-minute timeframe to enter the trade. SL 3%, TP 6%. Keep in mind I have little experience coding and used LLMs (GPT and Colab's Gemini) to do the majority of the coding for me, so this is super rudimentary in both its design and assumptions. The results can be found below:

    --- Trade Summary ---
    Result
    Loss    35
    Win     24
    Open     1
    Name: count, dtype: int64
    
    Expected Value per Trade: 0.0065
    Win Rate: 40.00% | Loss Rate: 58.33%

If i'm understanding correctly, this would mean that in a 60-day trading period, my profit would be 24 x 0.06 - 35 x 0.03 = 39%. If I were to factor in commission fees, would the EV be high enough to end up in net profit?

I am stuck in a losing position: 04/25 $544C SPY. 
I have two contracts at $10.18 each. Current price is $2.76, and I expect it to be lower on Monday due to theta. Delta is 21. 

Do you think I could save it by DCA on Monday? I could add 4 more contracts to bring the average cost to $4-5. This would bring my breakeven to high $530s. 

Is it even worth DCA into an option position that lost so much value? 04/25 is only four trading days away…

1jz868y_SPY,SPY,"Loss Porn: SPY $515 Puts, a Masterclass in Financial Acrobatics","So, I decided to spice up my Friday afternoon by purchasing 107 SPY $515 puts set to expire today. Because you know, who needs a weekend free from anxiety?

SPY responded by moonwalking to 541, turning my puts into digital fossils. Robinhood doesn’t even acknowledge their existence anymore they’re just ghost entries haunting my portfolio.

But here’s the twist… I’m still standing. Portfolio is over $500k, YTD gains at 45% down from 60%. This loss? A mere plot twist in my epic saga.

Moral of the story?
1) If you see a bird flying backward, it’s not a bearish omen…it’s just a glitch in the matrix and you’re the bug. 
2) Zero dte options are not a strategy, they’re a cry for help written in candle patterns. 
3) Never trust a chart you read after three energy drinks, tequila sodas and one emotional breakdown.

And now… I will rise!

The next play? Legendary.
Not “made money” legendary.
More like “SEC read the thread out loud during a board meeting” legendary.

No research. No stop loss. Just raw, uncut vibes.
This isn’t about revenge it’s about destiny.

It’s gonna be the kind of move that either ends up on CNBC or as a warning slide in a Blackrock onboarding video.
There is no in between.


Stay tuned.
Because either I’m printing tendies…
or becoming a case study in “what not to do with your hard earned money.”

Time to YOLO so hard, even my therapist will need therapy. 

STAY FABULOUS REGARDS.

Once things become normal, I plan to close early.

Any recommendations on how to do it?

Longer termed options have less theta decay, so I lose less over time, but risk more on index picking up again. 14 day single option contract has theta of 60 for 510 strike.

On the other side, volatility is high, so if that dies down, I also lose more money with SPY trading sideways.

Another option is of course ""sell everything"", but then I probably suck timing to re-enter.

Any experience or recommendations for that strategy?

1jx30s4_BA,BA,"Strategize for next week: situation speculation, gold, silver, plat, spy, BA, FXI and more","First of all, let us agree there are disagreements. Some Americans believe that China will implode in the next several months under tariff. Some Chinese believe that a U.S. civil war is imminent due to high inflation. I am not interested in debating with extremists, but you are welcome to comment below.

Let us revisit what happened this week. This is my understanding:

1. President Trump implemented global tariff, including up to 145% tariff on China. The market wasn't fully anticipating it, so the stock market crashed
2. The risk spread to the bond market, and the basis trade began to unravel. 10y and 30y treasury yield went up 75 to 100 bps in days, which means the bondholder of 30y lost 11%. Trump paused the tariff, and market went up wildly
3. Japan hedge fund exploded and saved the market on Wednesday. Nevertheless, there is still around $1T-2T basis trade to unwind. 10y is still 4.5% upon closing
4. The fickle policy led to a certain degree of de-dollarization. Over the last 24 hours, USD began to depreciate again all currencies, and drove gold and silver price up
5. Stock market bet that Fed must intervene by buying treasury bonds or cut down interest rate, so SPY went up 1.8% today
6. Trump must beat rate down to around 3% before refinancing $6-7T in late June
7. My SPY put expiring today is a 100% loss. lol

There are lot of binary events to happen, such as:

* Whether Trump will pause China tariff. This is a low possibility event, but some people suspect this may happen, because the stock market is too resilient today. If this happens, all market goes up dramatically, gold and silver will go down
* Whether Fed will cut interest rate. This is a mid-possibility event. The basis trade and carry trade are unwinding at the same time, and we may explode Sunday night. If Fed cut interest rates, all market goes up dramatically. Inflation may go out of control in the next several months, but who cares about that far out...
* Whether Trump will reach deal with any country that jointly imposes tariff on China. This is a low possibility event. Since Trump changes decisions hourly (he threatened to put more tariff on Mexico due to some water rights), I doubt whether any country will trust him that much. In addition, China may retaliate if another country, such as Japan, decides to impose tariff on China. Nevertheless, if that happens, U.S. stock goes up, China stock goes down. Not sure about gold or silver

My speculations are:

1. Nothing will happen quickly next week and we will still be living in this uncertain limbo. Therefore, keeping a position on gold and silver is necessary, if USD's global reserve status is weakened. USD will still be the primary reserve, since no other country have both the military power and can owe that much money.
2. Inspired by gold and silver, I decide to get others too. PPLT is platinum and PALL is palladium. When China keeps selling treasury, it surely won't hold USD cash and wait for it to depreciate. Maybe we have an outsized chance on plat and palladium
3. Bitcoin may have a good opportunity, but that is a separate issue. Also, I like GNS way more
4. Put BA and Call BYD. EU is negotiating with China now to remove EV barrier. I can only speculate one reason: EU wants to sell airbus aircrafts to China in exchange of opening EV barriers. This is bad for BA and good for BYD. I don't want to be suicided by BA, so I will stop here
5. Keep FXI calls. Trump will continue to find weapons to threaten China, and mentioned he may delist China Stocks. That is probably unlikely, but you don't know Trump - can you imagine a U.S. president issued a memecoin before inauguration? Nevertheless, Aug 2025 FXI calls have IV of 32% to 35%, which seems insanely low. You can also check MCHI, TCHI, KWEB, KSTR, and pick whatever flavor you like
6. Continue holding coal. In two years, China navy will outweigh U.S. navy, and U.S. navy doesn't even have repair capabilities now. Therefore Trump must rebuild steelmaking and shipbuilding, which requires coal. I also lost big on NUE calls because the market doesn't believe U.S. steelmakers have a chance - they may have a point.
7. I kept a small put position in case of a black Monday.

1jwdyo5_SPY,SPY,"Turned $20k into $40k overnight on SPY puts, then realized I could’ve had $250k. I am simultaneously a genius and a certified potato.","Well boys, I’m a gambler, but with an MBA in Finance and Economics, which makes me a dangerous retard. Like, I paid six figures to learn how to lose money more efficiently.

So yesterday, while drunk off six tequila sodas and 2.5 bad decisions, I had a vision from the stonk gods (or maybe it was just the hangover kicking in early). I slapped $20k on 150 SPY $525 puts that expired today. Full send. Balls deep. No lube. Just vibes.

Woke up this morning, still half-pickled from last night, saw my account was at $40k. Doubled up. Cool. But my brain—operating at a solid 12% capacity—said, “Nice tendies, let’s not be greedy.” So I sold.

Then I blacked out again metaphorically this time—l and didn’t check the markets until mid-day.

Opened my app…

And those same contracts?

Would’ve been worth $250k.
That’s right. A quarter-freaking-million dollars. From a $20k YOLO. I could’ve walked into Gucci and asked for the deed. I could’ve adopted a baby dolphin. I could’ve bought 500,000 McChickens and still had cash for sauce.

But no.

I locked in my peasant gains and left a private island worth of tendies on the table.

Moral of the story?
Being a responsible trader is for cowards.
Risk management is a scam.
And most importantly, never trade sober.

A win is a win—but this one stinks worse than my ex’s crypto picks.

Anyway, I’ve just thrown the $40k into $50 call options on SQQQ that expire next Friday. We ride again, baby.

But yesterday, the market wasn't moving at all so I opted out of trading as I dont want to risk losing more than what I have but the SPY ended up at 540 ish. I lost all my money trading options back when the money would keep jigsawing and it kept hitting my stop losses. 

Yes, I learned a valuable lesson. Yes, now I stick to my rules strictly now after a painful lesson. However, I am just worried there won't be an opportunity anymore for me to consistently make like $50/$100 a day during this month. 

Will it be safe again to rely on my technical analysis indicators to ride out a wave and just take $100 profit a day per trade?

I know many of you trade 0DTE spy contracts and hold them as late as you possibly can. I use to do this too, but my pesky broker would always sell me out before EOD because of assignment risk. If this is something that pisses you off, I may have a solution for you.

SPX contracts.

SPX follows S&P500

But more importantly, SPX contracts are **CASH SETTLED**.

Which means, the contracts themselves will just pay you the difference in price at expiration, No need to sell.

Which also means your pesky broker has no need to sell you out end of day, because you do not have any assignment risk nor will you have to buy/sell shares at exercise time.

Did I also mention these contracts are **TAX-ADAVNTAGED**.

Any profits from these contracts are taxed at **60% long-term/ 40% short-term**.

You can hold these bad boys all the way to close on expiration day for massive swings of dopamine or depression.

if interested, ask your fellow regards if SPX contracts are right for you.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying they are too poor: **SPREADS**  
Others have mentioned **XSP** which is a cheaper alternative, may be a bit less liquid",2025-04-08,1603,329

THEN I found this wonderful opportunity. 4/20 is coming up, and SPY $420 is very possible. AND I bought this put contract for $420. 

the only issue is there’s no expiry for 4/20, so I won’t be holding this until 4/21 and selling it on 4/20 no matter what happens.

1jrp6mc_MAR,MAR,HYG Puts/Spreads Might Be a Smart Hedge for SPY Right Now,"If you're looking for a hedge against more downside in $SPY, take a look at $HYG (the high-yield corporate bond ETF). During the March 2020 COVID crash, $HYG dropped \~20% in just 13 trading days, trailing $SPY’s decline but catching up fast as credit markets cracked.

In March 2020:

* $HYG fell from $85 → $68 (−19.3%) from Mar 6 to Mar 23
* That decline lagged equities by a few days, then accelerated
* $SPY was already collapsing — $HYG followed as junk bond risk blew out

Why HYG puts or vertical spreads are a great SPY hedge now:

* HYG typically holds up better — but cracks hard when credit stress hits
* Puts on HYG are cheaper (lower IV) than SPY/VIX
* You can express a credit tail risk thesis without fighting SPY’s high options premiums

What to use:

* HYG put spreads (like $75/$70 April 17): cheap, risk-defined, 10x potential
* OTM HYG puts (like $74 or $72): lotto-style plays if markets panic

How long to hold?

* These setups work best over 1–3 week windows
* If SPY keeps dumping and VIX/credit spreads blow out, HYG could drop 5–10% fast
* After that, credit support (like Fed action) often slows the move, so time your exit

TL;DR: If you're already short SPY or long volatility, HYG puts or spreads are a cleaner, lower-cost hedge for the next wave of fear — just like March 2020. The Fed isn’t likely to jump in like 2020 unless something breaks. But if credit markets start spiraling — illiquidity, no bids, ETF NAV breaks — they’ve already shown they’ll act. Until then, you’re trading a window where credit weakness can accelerate without interference.

2. Volume

I see increased volume 580. But at the same time 570 negative volume. 570 I still don't know, maybe its just sold puts what is positive for market.

3. Vix is still low.

4. Skew

Skew today is more negative then yesterday. Interesting dips on 572, 578, 582. So I say flat day. Premium burning. But maybe we grid upward very slowly.

Let me explain what you’re looking at here. Looking at the chart, you’ll see where I drew the white line going in a downward trend, but at the same time on the bottom of the screen (TSI indicator) it’s going in an uptrend. Around this time price was really slowing down so it made me feel even better about this. 

I waited for the buy signal, bought $575 calls and grabbed around 30% for a decent trade in the afternoon. These types of patterns literally pop up every single day, and I hope my posts are encouraging others to dig deeper into this strategy to really utilize it, it’s life changing if you have good discipline! 

Hope all of you had a winner today, let’s keep the train moving this week, should see more volatility 😬",2025-03-26,4,9

1jjy7fv_SPY,SPY,SPY 0DTE Pointers,"Looking for advice on how to improve. Long story somewhat short, I have been studying options to the best of my ability and studied for a few months prior to going live. About 2 weeks ago or so I deposited my first $500 into Robinhood. Had plenty of consecutive wins of small amounts bringing my account to roughly $3500 and was feeling good. My strategy is scalping watching MACD, RSI and Price Action for trends usually somewhere between VWAP, 50 and 200 day SMAs, and Bollinger Bands. 

Everything was going good until this past Friday on the triple witching day. I lost approximately $1100 on a single trade. Being a novice at best, I knew I shouldn’t have traded that day but I figured what better way to learn than trial by fire. I laughed at my loss and drove on. 

Yesterday I was back up $490 and feeling good again, and today I’m down another $1100 or so. During my trades, I ensure keeping my emotions in check, make sure to not get greedy, and have done zero revenge trades. I prefer to only do one trade a day, usually after the first 15 to 30 minutes after market open and out long before lunch. 

I have noticed SPY is slowing down with the lowered volatility making my strategy somewhat harder to implement in these conditions. Is the part of it? Did I pick a bad time to learn? What is some recommendations from guys who have been doing longer than me? I’m open to strategy improvements, reading material, literally anything that I can improve my self. 

Also as of now, I will be withdrawing my current port (still up almost $1200 over initial deposit) and using it for something worthwhile and deposit another $500 when I feel my strategy has improved. ",2025-03-25,108,85

1ji8bie_SPY,SPY,SPY to 420,"This is a weird post to write because half the people reading it are going to respond with *no fucking shit* but I'm seeing everyone from random WSB shitposters to fancy-pants investment bankers saying we've found the bottom so let's fucking do this.

The Atlanta Fed's [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) currently has a -1.8% annualized decline in real GDP for Q1 2025. What does that mean? Well, the [BEA](https://www.bea.gov/help/glossary/recession) will tell you that ""the often-cited identification of a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth is not an official designation"" and ""the designation of a recession is the province of a committee of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)""—but that two quarters of negative GDP growth definition is pretty useful in practice. One quarter of economic contraction can be quickly forgotten, but two is generally a sign something is seriously wrong.

A -1.8% annualized decline in one quarter is only like a -0.45% actual decline, but be honest with yourself: does it look like we're fucking done? GDPNow's methodology is similar to the BEA's except that instead of waiting for all the data to come in they update it continuously as new data is released. That does mean the decline could shrink as more data comes in—but it also means the inputs are all stuff that's already actually happened, stuff like ""construction spending"" and ""retail sales"". It doesn't even try to model the effects of leading indicators like [collapsing consumer sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/university-of-michigan-consumer-sentiment-survey-drops-in-march-to-57point9-worse-than-expected.html), much less predict the future effects of policy changes.

So let's talk about those policy changes, starting with tariffs, since those have been getting a lot of attention. We seem to be at the stage where people who want to believe everything's going to be OK are combing through Trump's statements for whatever scraps of reassurance they can find, which they can do because of Trump's tendency to speak in word-salad and promise everything to everyone.

For example, here's an [answer](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/trump-says-therell-be-flexibility-on-reciprocal-tariffs.html) he gave  on Friday to a question in an Oval Office press conference (transcription mine):

>People are coming to me and talking about tariffs and a lot of people are asking me if they can have exceptions, and once you do that for one you have to do that for all, so I mean generally, I did something interestingly during two weeks ago, I gave the American car companies a break because it would've been unfair if I didn't and everybody said ""oh he changed his mind on tariffs!"" I didn't change my mind I helped our, you know, sort of big three, big four, I helped some of the American companies and instead of taking it properly they said ""oh he changed his—"" I don't change, but the world ""flexibility""'s an important word, sometimes there's flexibility, so there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal so that if China's charging us 50% or 30% or 20%, and I don't mean China I mean anybody, any country, Canada, nobody knows that Canada's charging our dairy farmers, they have 270% tariffs, nobody knows that, nobody knows that, they have up to 400%, they have a couple of tariffs, at 400%, nobody knows that, nobody talks about that.

He then went off on an extended tangent about why Canada should be a US state before ending by reiterating that ""nobody knows that they were getting 270% tariffs on dairy products"". And people have, in apparent seriousness, cited this answer as a reason for optimism, because he said there will be flexibility! Beyond the obvious rebuttals, it should be noted that the example he gave of ""flexibility"" was a [one-month pause](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-lutnick-2b269614084027a4894aa14f3dc16227), meaning tariffs are still coming for U.S. automakers.

The economic effects of mass-firings, along with cancelling leases and other contracts, don't get discussed as much. But they'll likely be quite serious. Mass-firings of federal workers could have an apocalyptic effect on the economies of Virginia and Maryland, effects by no means limits to the public sector, because those public sector employees are going to have to cut their spending at countless private businesses. Similarly, cancellation of leases threatens to crash real estate markets.

And while the many of the effects may be concentrated in the DC metro area, there are major government offices spread throughout the country, so the mass-firings and lease cancellations will create little pockets of economic pain everywhere. Some effects may even be concentrated in rural areas—like the effects of [cancelling contracts to buy food from American farmers to distribute as food aid](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311663/farmers-will-be-hit-hard-by-the-dismantling-of-usaid).

Then there's the fact that many of the fired federal workers were actually doing stuff that's really important for the US economy to functions. Firing FAA workers threatens to hurt airlines and domestic tourism. Firing people at the CDC makes it harder to fight bird flu, which is bad not just for the egg industry but also beef and dairy. And so on.

Finally there's Trump's immigration policies, whose effects range from farm workers being afraid to show up for work to completely fucking international tourism because apparently multi-week detentions of random tourists from [Europe](https://apnews.com/article/border-tourists-german-canadian-detention-immigration-408cd27338e8065268fabc835f8b0c34) and [Canada](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney) is a thing we're doing now. Recently there was a forecast of a [5% decline in international tourism](https://fortune.com/2025/03/17/foreign-tourism-us-forecast-trump-tariffs-trade-war-russia-ukraine-war/) which under the circumstances actually strikes me as optimistic.

I suspect the main reason a lot of people resist seeing what's staring them in the face is that during Trump's first administration the economy did okay until COVID hit. ""Util COVID hit"" is a pretty big caveat, especially with RFK Jr. running HHS, but never mind that. The bigger issue is that during his first term, there were still people in both the Republican congressional caucuses and his own administration willing to tell Trump ""no"". We don't seem to have that anymore, unless you count X Æ A-12 telling him to ""shush"".

So TLDR; all signs point to us already having experienced an economic contraction in Q1 2025, and there's every reason to expect it to continue into Q2 and beyond. A recession, in other words. Of course, the question we all want to know on WallStreetBets is what this means for the stock market.

Faithful believers in the efficient market hypothesis will insist everything I've described and more is already ""priced in"", to which I say: LOL. So far the S&P 500 has fallen 10% peak to trough, but a 10% drop is a fucking sneeze by stock market standards. I remember back in 2015 when my boss told me he was selling all his stocks because of some bullshit with China. I *didn't* sell because I didn't want to be the guy who sold at the bottom, but by the time the 2015-2016 selloff was over the S&P 500 was down 14%—over fucking *nothing*.

An actual recession probably means a much more severe decline in stock prices. If I believed Trump administration messaging about [""temporary pain""](https://gazette.com/news/wex/trump-officials-acknowledge-temporary-pain-amid-tariffs-and-market-unease/article_0186aba5-768e-572d-be2f-e9f2ef31ecbf.html), the precedent I'd be looking at is Paul Volker more or less causing a recession on purpose to fight inflation, which involved a 27% decline in the S&P 500. But Trump and Musk aren't Paul fucking Volker, so I'm expecting a greater than 30% decline.

How much more than 30%? Beats me, but assuming a decline of 31.5% decline from SPY's $612.93 peak yields a nice, easy-to-remember target price of $420. It could easily go even lower, but will almost certainly bounce back, and a lot of people aren't going to want to miss the recovery. Therefore, I wouldn't feel too stupid going long SPY at $420. At its current price, though, count me out.

So what do you do about it? Full-porting SPY 12/31 430p is obviously insanely risky. And unfortunately, given the range of tail-risks we're facing—the debt ceiling, Trump deciding to actually act on [previous comments that much US government debt might be fraudulent](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud), or even fucking with the banking system—I don't think any position is entirely safe. That said, here's what I've currently got.  ""Other"" stocks is GLD, domestic bonds are overwhelmingly TIPS:",2025-03-23,422,145

1jg0kxx_SPY,SPY,SPY Predictions for 3/21 – $4.5 Trillion in Options Expiring – Reddit Due Diligence LLC,"To everyone holding deep OTM SPY calls (or puts), buckle up—tomorrow is shaping up to be absolute mania.

On **Friday, March 21, 2025**, we’re looking at a **massive triple witching event** with over **$4.5 trillion** in options and futures contracts expiring. The sheer size of this expiry could lead to wild swings in both directions as institutions and market makers reposition.

# What to Expect:

📉 **Volatility Overload** – Expect sharp price moves as large positions roll off.  
⚡ **Max Pain Magnet?** – The max pain level might act as a price target before expiration.

# My Game Plan:

I’m holding some **SPY $570 calls** that have been getting cooked, so I’m looking to **unload into any rip** tomorrow and recover some losses. If the market tanks and my puts print, I'll be booking a weeklong beachfront villa vacation in Bali starting Saturday 3/22.

I think SPY will stay sideways (with massive up and down swings canceling out) through 1PM ET tomorrow and have significant downtrend going into the final 3 hours of the trading day as the clock winds down to expiration.  Perhaps a $555 - $558 close price tomorrow at end of day.  This is purely my own speculation.

# What’s Everyone’s Plan?

Are you playing this with calls, puts, or just sitting out and watching the chaos unfold? Let’s figure out how to navigate this madness.

Reflecting further on whether I think we’ve bottomed out, I mean I certainly hope we have, I stumbled on a couple posts on accounts that I follow that are making me think that we still have some more pain ahead.

On February 14, I bookmarked this in my usual day to day. This buzzer beater trade for $5M, 45DTE, seems to look like a brilliant play in retrospect. This, coupled with this VIX hammering caused me consider a sizeable short.

For context, at their peak, these contracts bought for $6 would have been marked at $49 (a cool $34M, 7x). They’re currently well in the money worth $33 (a measly $23M, 5x). Not sure if the original outlay has been pared back, I suspect so. Worth mentioning that this trade was placed when SPY was at ATHs.

So. today – another buzzer beater. Similar outlay ($4M), but much shorter timeframe. Most of what I said earlier about the reasons to be cautious are still very, if not more, relevant today.

Eerily similar?

More pain ahead? I suspect so, but like most of you, I’m hoping we’re closer to a bottom than not.

I’m not a trader. I will take lotto shots here and there on stuff like this, but I am net long and buy in my long-term portfolio weekly, regardless of price action. I was very convinced being short last month was the right play. I have less conviction in shorting here but I’ll leave it to the technical traders to discuss levels of support/resistance, death-crosses and whatever other chart-related interpretations they can provide.

All documented on YT/X. Never selling courses or shilling a discord.

TL:DR –

I saw weird stuff last month that suggested pain. Pain ensued.

I’m seeing similar stuff this week that suggests more pain ahead, but I’m of the opinion (and hope) that we’re closer to a bottom than not.

I am looking at very low delta of 0.02 in 15 days from now with SPY. If I do a put credit spread, I could easily get \~$20 with a margin account (backed by long equity also). Here I mean, SPY going close to 500 in next two weeks is very low chance (currently around 560).

Seems like high probability if we sell puts around 500 with a call below to back it up (to avoid assignment etc.,), we can easily get \~$20 with very low investment.

1j7yosg_MA,MA,SPY Options Trade Plan 2025-03-10,"### Market Trend Analysis of SPY:

- **Current Share Price**: SPY is currently trading at $568.15.

- **Moving Averages**: 
  - The 10-day MA has been trending upward, suggesting short-term bullish momentum with the latest value at $575.67.
  - The 50-day MA ($574.14) and 200-day MA ($567.39) indicate a longer-term bullish trend as the current price is above these levels.

- **RSI**: The 10-day RSI at 53.56% indicates that the market is neither overbought nor oversold, with potential for continued upward movement.

- **Volume**: There has been significant volume today, especially at the close, indicating strong interest in the stock.

- **VIX**: The VIX, or ""fear index,"" has risen to 26.38, which could suggest an increase in expected volatility, often associated with bearish sentiment or market uncertainty.

- **News and Sentiment**:
  - There are mixed signals with headlines suggesting both potential for a bullish continuation (Citi's target of 6,500) and bearish sentiments (Trump hinting at a recession).
  - News about companies joining the S&P 500 might suggest a sector rotation or new capital inflow, potentially positive for SPY.

### Max Pain Theory:

- **Max Pain Level**: For today's 0DTE options, the max pain level appears to be around $570, where the total open interest of puts and calls would result in the least financial loss for option writers.

### Options Strategy:

Given the mixed signals:

- **Directional Bias**: The market data suggests a slightly bullish short-term trend with the price above the moving averages and a non-overbought RSI. However, the increased VIX and some bearish news headlines introduce uncertainty.

- **Strategy**: 
  - **Call Buying**: Given the current data, the trend seems to lean slightly bullish, especially with the 10-day MA trending upward and the price action. 

**Trade Recommendation**:

- **Strike Price**: Buy the $570 Call option.
  - **Reason**: This strike is close to the current price and also near the max pain level, suggesting that if the market moves in either direction, there's a reasonable chance the price will gravitate towards this level due to option expirations.

- **Entry**: 
  - **Option Price**: The ask price for the $570 Call is $2.53, which is within your acceptable range of $0.30 to $0.50 for average option price. However, this price is at the higher end, which might reflect higher expected volatility or less favorable conditions for buying calls.

- **Exit**: 
  - **Target**: Set a target of $572 (a 2-point move above the strike price), which could be hit if the bullish trend continues.
  - **Stop Loss**: If the price drops below $567, consider exiting to minimize losses.

- **Confidence**: Given the mixed signals but a slight bullish bias:
  - **Confidence Level**: 70%. 

### Summary:

The strategy is to buy a $570 call option due to the current price action and moving averages indicating a bullish trend, despite some bearish news. The option's price is at the higher end of your preferred range, reflecting market uncertainty, but the position near the max pain level could act as a magnet for the stock price. The trade has a reasonable chance of success if the bullish sentiment persists, but caution is advised due to the elevated VIX and potential for a market correction.",2025-03-10,8,7

1j6xis4_O,O,25k SPY puts yolo (WSBlong),"Been waiting for SPY to break below its lows since election to confirm my thoughts on where we are heading. Played puts early in the week and made a few K but sold. Was going to buy back in but hesitated and missed out. Finally bought back in and these were up, but decided I’d hold this time instead of sell like I did with my OG puts. Those OG puts hit 100% at the bottom Friday. So this time I decided to hold and we will see how that goes. Worst case scenario imo it could take till beginning of April to tank, but I figured I’d hop in now so I don’t miss out if it crawls down little by little till then.

Nobody knows obviously, but I feel pretty confident we’re heading down hard. In my opinion I know “this is different” is kind of getting memed, but I genuinely believe that to be the case. There has been an underlying system since WWII with America at the helm in many ways. There has been decades of role propositioning and reinforcement through reconstruction after the war. So many people talk about an “overvalued” market, when it really wasn’t in a relative sense of what American markets represented with reliability, certainty, and trust. I think SOME damage has already been done, and nothing is gonna change that for a long time. In my opinion it really just comes down to how much damage will ultimately be done. With that said, with this administration, and my own run away thoughts, I really can’t pin how far a drop I see as realistic, but obviously with my play I’m expecting around -3% from here absolute minimum.

1j5c2nv_SPY,SPY,Late morning divergence on $SPY,"Being patient in this market has been extremely rewarding over the past couple of weeks. Waited for the right setup, and jumped on it today. 

What you’re looking at here is a triple top on the 3m chart, which is my preferred timeframe. Price is coming back up to the same level making equal/similar highs, but not able to break above. While I’m seeing this play out, I’m also paying attention to the TSI at the bottom, we’re making lower highs at the same time the chart is making equal highs. This is another confirmation that I look for in taking a position. 

I waited for a sell signal then grabbed $579 puts 0DTE, which ended up paying QUICKLY. Grabbed 30% and ended my day. 

These are the types of trade everyone should be looking out for, especially when trading $SPY! Happy to help/answer any questions you might have, I want to see everyone succeed in trading, because it truly is cutthroat.

Every morning I let LLM to analyze stock market data (prices, TA, news, VIX) when market is open, here is the trade of the day :

\---

**Market Trend Analysis of SPY**Given the current market conditions:**Strategy**: **Buy Naked Puts\*\*\*\*Entry Plan**:

1. **Price Action**:
   * The current share price of SPY is **574.5**.
   * The 10-day Moving Average (MA) on the 5-minute chart indicates a slight downward trend, with the latest price being **581.909311** at the opening today, significantly below the recent highs.
   * The daily chart shows a consistent downward trend over the past few days, with the 10-day MA at **587.354878** indicating a bearish short-term outlook.
2. **Volume**:
   * Today's pre-market volume (1,443,573 shares) is relatively high, suggesting increased interest or concern in the market.
3. **Sentiment Indicators**:
   * **RSI**: The 10-day RSI has dropped from the 50s to **19.72** indicating the market might be oversold, potentially signaling a rebound or a deeper sell-off.
   * **VIX**: The VIX has increased to **24.25**, showing higher market volatility, often associated with bearish sentiment or fear.
4. **News and Economic Indicators**:
   * Multiple headlines point to economic uncertainty, with mentions of declining business and consumer confidence, potential threats to the dollar's reserve status, and interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank.
   * The ISM Services PMI expanded, but overall, the news suggests a bearish or cautious market outlook.

* **Short-term bearish signals** with a potential for a slight rebound due to the oversold RSI.
* **Increased volatility** which can work both ways but primarily suggests caution.
* **Strike Price**: **570**
   * This is slightly out of the money but close enough to benefit from any immediate downward movement.
* **Expiration**: **0DTE** (Today)
   * Given the short-term bearish trend, buying options expiring today maximizes leverage on a potential immediate drop.
* Enter the trade when SPY show

1. \*\[*6:36 AM*\]\*s a break below the current support level or if there's a significant negative news event post-market open. **Exit Plan**:**Rationale**: The data from both charts, combined with economic indicators and news sentiment, strongly suggest a continuation of the bearish trend for today. However, the oversold RSI might lead to a temporary relief rally, hence the confidence isn't at 100%. The strategy leverages the immediate bearish outlook while allowing for a quick exit if the market dynamics change.Confidence Level:
   * **Exit at 50% profit** or if the market shows signs of reversing towards the 10-day MA on the 5-minute chart.
   * **Stop Loss**: Set at 10% of the option's premium cost to mitigate potential loss if the market unexpectedly rebounds.
   * **Confidence**: **75%**
      * The bearish signals are strong, but the RSI being oversold introduces a possibility for a short-term bounce.",2025-03-06,148,72

I, 30M, I have roughly 240k in a deferred compensation plan that is a 457b plan. I have roughly 90k in a taxable brokerage holding mag 7 stocks with no plan to sell.

I am now looking to start investing into a s&p500 etf. In a taxable brokerage account (around 40k to start). Would buy and hold VOO be the best route? I ideally would like to buy SPY and sell covered calls, but in a taxable account I feel like it’s not worth it with the tax events every time the shares get called away.

I cannot open a ROTH IRA because my income is over the threshold to contribute, however I do have a ROTH option in my 457b retirement plan that I contribute to the equivalent of a max ROTH contribution. 

As much as my interest in selling covered calls is, should I just buy VOO and chill? ",2025-03-05,2,15

1iz3wwy_SPY,SPY,SPY $607 Calls 5/16,"Hoping for a more experienced options trader to provide insight as to S&P’s latest price action - can we reasonably expect a bounce back to ATH territory within the next month or so, or would it be worth cutting my losses once 45 DTE rolls around? 

It seems as though these price fluctuations are pretty on par with recent history, although there is chatter that “this time is different” due to concerns about tariffs and consumer spending. From what I personally recall, the economy doesn’t really seem all that different compared to the last 8 months, but it could just be me - maybe you know something I don’t! We have every reason to believe that the S&P is guaranteed to rise, despite going through hills and valleys, as it is reflective of America’s economic performance as a whole. Doubt we’re going anywhere anytime soon, unless some sort of cataclysmic event happens. 

My personal price target is around 620 by May 1, solely based on TA in a vacuum, but I could be missing something here. That’s why I wanted to turn to you guys for some additional guidance. Looking for a productive discussion in the comments, serious answers only please :)",2025-02-27,16,42

1iyi0wv_SPY,SPY,📊 The Hard Truth About Shorting SPY: A Data-Driven Deep Dive (2015-2025),"Following up on a previous post about why you should not attempt to short the S&P 500 ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ixz88f/why\_you\_should\_not\_attempt\_to\_short\_the\_sp\_500/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ixz88f/why_you_should_not_attempt_to_short_the_sp_500/) ), I dug deeper into the data. The results were quite interesting.

# 🎯 TL;DR

* Short positions have a **<15% success rate** across most timeframes
* Average recovery time from 10%+ drawdowns: **209 days**
* Market spends **29.2%** of time in 5%+ drawdowns
* Annual cost of shorting: **5.7%** (Previous post)

# 📈 Volatility Regime Analysis

I analyzed SPY's behavior across four volatility regimes to understand when shorting might work:

# Low Volatility (0-10.7%)

* 21-day shorts: **5.0%** success
* 63-day shorts: **18.1%** success
* 252-day shorts: **8.9%** success

*Surprisingly, medium-term shorts performed best in calm markets*

# Moderate Volatility (10.7-13.4%)

* 21-day shorts: **2.4%** success
* 63-day shorts: **5.0%** success
* 252-day shorts: **14.7%** success

*Longer-term shorts showed better success in moderate volatility*

# High Volatility (13.4-18.4%)

* 21-day shorts: **7.8%** success
* 63-day shorts: **4.2%** success
* 252-day shorts: **9.4%** success

# Extreme Volatility (>18.4%)

* 21-day shorts: **10.6%** success
* 63-day shorts: **14.4%** success
* 252-day shorts: **8.1%** success

*Even in extreme volatility, success rates barely exceed 15%*

# 📉 Drawdown Characteristics

# Key Statistics

* Average Drawdown: **-4.4%**
* Median Drawdown: **-1.9%**
* Time in 5%+ drawdown: **29.2%**
* Time in 10%+ drawdown: **15.1%**

# Recovery Analysis

* Average recovery time (10%+ drawdowns): **209 days**
* Median recovery time: **172 days**
* Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe): **0.65**

# 🤔 What This Means For Traders

1. **Timing Is (Almost) Everything**
   * Even in high volatility, short success rates rarely exceed 15%
   * Medium-term shorts (63 days) paradoxically work best in low volatility
2. **The Recovery Problem**
   * Markets spend 70.8% of time *not* in significant drawdowns
   * When big drawdowns occur, recovery takes \~7 months on average
3. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**
   * Sharpe ratio of 0.65 suggests moderate risk-adjusted returns
   * This makes timing shorts even more challenging

# 💡 Strategic Implications

# When Shorting Might Work

* During extreme volatility (>18.4%)
* With shorter holding periods (21 days)
* When prepared for \~7 month recovery periods

# When to Avoid Shorting

* During moderate volatility (10.7-13.4%)
* With medium-term horizons in high volatility
* Without strict stop-loss rules

# 🛠️ Alternative Approaches

1. **Consider Options Strategies**
   * Put options limit downside risk
   * Can be more cost-effective than carrying costs of shorts
2. **Use Volatility Regimes**
   * Short-term trades in extreme volatility
   * Longer-term positions in moderate volatility
3. **Risk Management**
   * Set stops based on median drawdown (-1.9%)
   * Account for typical recovery periods (172-209 days)

# 📝 Conclusion

The data strongly suggests that successful shorting of SPY requires:

* Exceptional timing
* Strong risk management
* Understanding of volatility regimes
* Patience during recovery periods

*Remember: These statistics are based on historical data (2015-2025) and include both bull and bear markets.*

*💬 What are your experiences with shorting SPY? Have you found success in specific market conditions?*

I was playing around with some data on SPY from 2022 to present and figured out how to make a heat map in a calendar format based on the percent change from open to close. I didn't really see any major patterns in the data over that time period outside of what's already known - like, 2022 was volatile. 

However, I noticed that Monday's were generally more calm than all other days. And, although, some of the biggest red days in 2022 were Mondays, it still ended up being the 2nd best performing day of that year.

Fridays, on the other hand, are psychotic. Maybe its because people are trying to unwind all of their bad trades from the beginning of the week. I can't say, but the only thing this visualization does show about Friday's is that they can end up anywhere. It's like Monday's are the beginning of a wagging tail, and Friday's are the tip.

The one thing I did see that had a very strong probability was that very red Friday's (downward moves of 1.5% or more) seem to be followed by green Mondays. This does not take gaps into account. It's just based on ""closing price - opening price"". The data doesn't say ""buy at the end of the day on Friday"", but it does suggest that buying at Monday open after a -1.5% move, or greater, on Friday has, over the past few years had a great chance of being followed by a green Monday. 

If you see anything else, please share. 

Oh, and this past Friday had a move of -1.71%.

1imqi5v_SPY,SPY,SPX vs. SPY vs. QQQ 0DTE,"Profile: 

$8000 portfolio size 
6 years trading options ONLY (down $5,794 all time). I was down much more than this before. 

I trade 5-10% portfolio size per trade, with a max loss of 30% on that trade. 

I’ve been trading SPX only since beginning of 2025c and I’m up $900 YTD (I have a 65% win rate but my losses have been bigger than my wins due to me going on tilt as well as limitations on Robinhood. Yes I’m switching to Schwab soon, just hard when you work full time as well). 

My question is: 

What is better for me to trade, SPX, SPY, or QQQ? I keep going back to this -5700 loss after a good week… and it’s 99% my mind. But I want to see what others (that are hopefully profitable) think of my approach. 

I feel like I need to switch to QQQ or SPY because I can buy multiple in the money contracts versus one out the money contract on SPX. Although I do know I will pick OTM contracts for any if I feel that the set up is there.. 

I like to trail the 15 minute candles after I enter a trade, unless I see a 30% loss then I just sell. On Schwab this is very easy as I set up an auto 30% limit stop and auto take 150% profit. On my phone it’s impossible except to put a stop and manually take profits, hence leaving a lot of money on the table. 

 My strategy: levels on pre market high/low and supply areas to catch reversals. I also look for a divergence if I intend on entering a second trade later. The same day. I enter on 5 minute time frames and trail 15 until I am stopped out. This is with TOS. On Robinhood I enter and automatically exit once I make 40%. 

Edit: 

I’m not trading futures. I am strictly buying calls and puts. 

I don’t think losing 5k over six years is a fail, I think that’s a success specially when the average trader loses way more than me in a shorter time period. This is with almost daily trading. I have never given up. 

Not that it matters, but I’m positive ALL time by over 50,000 (I don’t only trade options, I also buy and hold stocks). This is my SMALL portfolio that I’m trying to learn trading on so I can stop working 9-5. 

I do not care about tax advantages, it’s not like I’m making hundreds of thousands yet to make it a big deal. I’m talking about strategies and what is best to trade with a portfolio this size. ",2025-02-11,17,41

1imkign_NVDA,NVDA,Bearish Divergence on $SPY,"Caught this bearish divergence on $SPY today, ended up getting around 44% on 0DTE $604 Puts. I still get messages all the time from people successfully using this strategy daily, and I’m really happy some are benefiting from it. 

For those confused, let me explain what you’re looking at here. 

If you’re looking at the chart, from the starting point where I drew the yellow line, to the new high is obviously higher highs being made on the chart, but at the exact same time, we’re making lower highs on the TSI (at the bottom)

Anytime I see this, and get a signal, I will enter that trade. I have some examples of bullish divergences on my Reddit as well, so feel free to look at those so you notice the difference between them. This is a strategy I have been using for years, and if you train your eyes to identify these, and stay patient, you will see some great success from them.

1hz3786_SPY,SPY,SPY vs SSO? Any reason not to buy SSO over SPY?,"Long term investor here. I like to buy and hold forever.

SSO is a leveraged ETF that aims to be 2x the returns of S&P. It has something like a 0.8% fee, which is obviously extremely high, but it works out because the returns are so high. The obvious downside, is the drawdowns are much higher.

The below shows the performance between the two since 2006. From my understanding, the fee is baked into the stock price. I did NOT factor in dividends. I adjusted for stock splits with SSO.

You can see SSO significantly outperformed, obviously so, since its leveraged. So, my question is this -- for money you don't have to touch for a very long time, why not get higher returns in SSO? Am I missing something? It seems like for at least part of a long term portfolio, some of it should be SSO as opposed to SPY.

Also is there something more leveraged than SSO?

1hyo2k6_SPY,SPY,I’m 100% SPY in my Roth IRA and taxable account. Is this ok? ,"32 year old male. No debt. No kids. Single. So at least all that's good. 

I live at home since everything is so expensive. My own house unfortunately will have to be further down the road, when I have $250k plus I'll reevaluate the house situation 

Anyway, to the main point. I have a total balance of close to $175,000 between my Roth IRA and taxable account. No 401k. It's about 50-50, between the two accounts. SPY having back to back 20+ % years certainly helped the balance. 

I never see just SPY recommended. It's always similar things, but never SPY. VTI, VOO, VT, VXUS? Etc

Is it ok to only have spy? 

I've only ever bought and not sold. I'd rather not go through the hassle of changing anything

1hw1rpw_SPY,SPY,$SPY Divergence Today,"Haven’t traded much since before the holidays, got back to the grind this week! Perfect setup here today, let me share. 

If you haven’t seen my strategy posts before, divergences are some of my favorite setups to take trading $SPY options. This one in particular today is a great example of what I like to look for. 

We had a pretty substantial drop from the $597 range down to close to $590. What you’re seeing with the lines I drew is a hidden bearish divergence, and these are usually very effective because it still is following the same downtrend. 

If you look where the lines are drawn, price is making a lower high, while the TSI below is making higher high. This is the first indication that a divergence may occur. The only other thing I wait for is the sell signal, in this case the golden sell signal from TO. If you use other technicals like VWAP, or EMAS, SMAs, etc.. you can also use those and wait for rejections/bounces off those key levels to confirm the divergence! 

I highly recommend everyone try this strategy for yourself. I think you’ll be pleased, I have had a lot of members reach out to me about this and doing more posts, so I hope this helps those that need it. 

Also hope everyone had a great holiday with Christmas and new years, let’s make 2025 the best year we’ve ever had 🥶",2025-01-07,50,74

1hqhusj_GOOGL,GOOGL,DCA into SPY by selling puts? 250k never traded options before.,"Hi guys, I will try to give context to my whole situation while also keeping it brief.

After all income minus expenses (mortgage, other) I have a surplus of about 2-3k a month that I just collect in my bank. For the past few years it was just rotting in my BOA account, but recently I moved it to Robinhood so it atleast gets 4% now.

A few years ago I put 50k in GTE, sold it when it hit 65k. Had to pay taxes on the 15k. Then put the 65k into SDC. DCA’d when stock fell in half and put in another 50k. SDC went bankrupt so I lost 115k. Would be nice if I could tax harvest it some how.

Also this whole time I was not putting any money into 401k or Roth. A month ago filled up my Roth for the Robinhood bonus, and will deposit another 7k in a few days. And a few days ago I finally went to my HR portal and enabled max 401k. Why it took me this long, I don’t know.

Anyways, I already made every possible financial mistake, so I was just trying to make the final biggest one of all. Timing the market. That is why I let my savings ballon to 250k (even after the SDC loss) .

But I just read somewhere that selling puts of SPY is like DCA’ing plus you also get paid a premium.

As you can see, I am financially illiterate, I’ve never traded options before, although I do have a Robinhood account, and I’m smart enough to know how to have a good job that pay wells. Can someone help me walk through this?

I understand that when I enter a contract to sell puts, I buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price. If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price. 

If the stock goes down however, than my option expires worthless, but I don’t care because I was hoping for that to happen if my goal was to DCA into SPY. I already bought the 100 shares. I just got paid the premium for giving someone an option to speculate on them.

I have a couple of questions, first when doing this option, is there a particularly security to choose? Like SPY or VOO or SPLG or just the stocks I want to invest in like, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google.

For example, I noticed SPY has a ton of dates for selling puts, whereas SPLG only has 5 possible dates, roughly 2-3 months apart.

My goal is to maximize bid price right? The lower you try to sell the put for, usually the lower the bid price. 
Also if I try to sell a put that expires in a few days, usually the bid price is a few dollars. A month away, it goes up to $10. But two months away, it doesn’t double to $20, it goes to around $12-$14. So that is why the most optimal puts are to buy the ones that are a month away. Because you collect the premium and can choose to invest into selling more puts again more quickly (if stock went up).

Should I try to care about limit order or market order?

Right now I’m looking at SPY, the current price is $588.70, and there is a put for $588 on Feb 21st with a bid price of $10.21

So irregardless, I make $1,021. If stock goes down, I was planning to DCA into SPY, so now I own 100 shares. If stock goes up, someone else makes more money. Since I have 250k, I can do this trade 4 times, and at the end of February, I either have 250k plus 4k, or I have 400 shares of SPY

I guess now the question becomes how do I maximize the bid price while not doing something crazy? What is the best strategy for this?

Plus I kinda do still believe in timing the market a little. I feel like there might be a sharp drop around end of Jan (Trump) and then we will probably trend downwards or sideways for a year or so. I’m curious if you guys agree or disagree or what are your market predictions. I feel like recession sentiment is growing, but I don't know how that correlates to an actual recession.",2024-12-31,0,26

1hjizbu_GS,GS,SPY should rally 10 points or so over the next three days,"I was told I was in the wrong thread when I posted this. So here is a stand alone post.

I think I am going to wait for market open with an upward bias. If SPY breaks the top of the opening 5 minute candle, then retests that level, I am going to get in. Pretty much all the historical charts show that when the debt ceiling gets raised and a shut down is averted, the market reacts in an upward motion to the tune of 10 points or so over the next next week. 

Plus, that selloff that just happened, maps to the 8-5 sell off and the recovery of it so far. So that is even more upward pressure.

I went though all the charts from the all the Government Shutdown Mexican Standoffs we have had since 2018. Holy christ, I am not going to get into politics, but it happens like clockwork every year, shutdown threats start in June, brinksmanship happens, then they pass a last minute bill to stop gap the funding. The market rises after a deal is announced, Senate passes the bill, or President signs it. Not so much on the latter, but it did happen enough. The real juice is in the announcement.

Here is the charts with a brief about each one:

Here we have January of 2018. This was a budget deal that was signed after the government shutdown briefly. Trump signed the bill 2/9/18. You can see the market tore back up by 10 points the next two days.

https://imgur.com/3DoeznQ


This next one see was the border wall funding fight. The budget passed with out the border funding, so Trump shut down the government. He ultimately signed the bill on 1/25 he announce his support for a 3 week extension.

https://imgur.com/xcUakUU


Here is the end of 2019, where yet again, another Mexican stand off. Congress announced a deal on 11/20/19 and signed into law on 11/21/19.

https://imgur.com/3s76uY2

1hjizbu_F,F,SPY should rally 10 points or so over the next three days,"I was told I was in the wrong thread when I posted this. So here is a stand alone post.

I think I am going to wait for market open with an upward bias. If SPY breaks the top of the opening 5 minute candle, then retests that level, I am going to get in. Pretty much all the historical charts show that when the debt ceiling gets raised and a shut down is averted, the market reacts in an upward motion to the tune of 10 points or so over the next next week. 

Plus, that selloff that just happened, maps to the 8-5 sell off and the recovery of it so far. So that is even more upward pressure.

I went though all the charts from the all the Government Shutdown Mexican Standoffs we have had since 2018. Holy christ, I am not going to get into politics, but it happens like clockwork every year, shutdown threats start in June, brinksmanship happens, then they pass a last minute bill to stop gap the funding. The market rises after a deal is announced, Senate passes the bill, or President signs it. Not so much on the latter, but it did happen enough. The real juice is in the announcement.

Here is the charts with a brief about each one:

Here we have January of 2018. This was a budget deal that was signed after the government shutdown briefly. Trump signed the bill 2/9/18. You can see the market tore back up by 10 points the next two days.

This next one see was the border wall funding fight. The budget passed with out the border funding, so Trump shut down the government. He ultimately signed the bill on 1/25 he announce his support for a 3 week extension.

Here's how it played out.

**The Strategies**

1. **Yearly Lump Sum**: Investing $10,000 at the beginning of each year.
2. **Monthly Investment**: Breaking $10,000 into 12 equal parts ($833.33) and investing at the start of each month.
3. **Daily Investment**: Spreading $10,000 evenly across all trading days in a year.

**Overall Results (End of 2024)**

* **Yearly Lump Sum**: $53,461, with an overall cumulative return of **\~434.6%**.
* **Monthly Investment**: $51,435, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.4%**.
* **Daily Investment**: $51,446, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.5%**.

After conducting a 20-year test comparing three popular investment strategies—lump-sum investing, monthly contributions, and daily contributions—I found that the yearly lump-sum strategy provided the highest overall returns. At first glance, this might seem like a definitive answer to the perennial question of how to invest for the best outcome. But the more I analyzed the results, the more I began to question whether the data truly tells the whole story.

EDIT:

my resaerch was completely wrong and goes to show that AI is only as good as the data that you put into it. These are the final results after some tweaks:  
  
**Yearly Lump Sum**: $163,573.96

**Monthly Investment:** $180,559.47

**Weekly Investment:** $182,003.40

**Daily Investment:** $131,120.43

Weekly and Monthly Investment Strategies strike the best balance between risk mitigation and compounding growth. While the Lump Sum Strategy benefits from early exposure in bull markets, it is more susceptible to downturns. The Daily Strategy, despite reducing timing risk, suffers from delayed compounding and is less effective over time.",2024-12-08,32,62

**Abstract**

This examines the KEY 5 SPY Strategy, an adaptive approach to portfolio rotation that combines technical efficiency measurement (KER - Kaufman Efficiency Ratio) with fundamental value assessment (FCF Yield) to select and weight positions among the S&P 500's top constituents. We explore both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation details that make this strategy particularly effective in real-world trading conditions.

**Hypothesis**

The strategy posits that combining price efficiency (KER) with fundamental value (FCF Yield) identifies stocks with sustainable momentum. By measuring how efficiently price moves alongside a company's ability to generate free cash flow, we can select securities where technical trend and fundamental strength reinforce each other. The strategy hypothesizes that optimally / adaptively weighting these factors within the most liquid S&P 500 constituents produces superior risk-adjusted returns compared to single-factor approaches.

**1. Introduction: Why This Strategy Matters**

Let's start with a simple truth: most strategies that look great in backtests fall apart in live trading. What makes the KEY 5 SPY Strategy different? The answer lies in its adaptive combination of two factors that complement each other in ways that might not be immediately obvious.

Think of KER as your technical analyst with a physics degree - instead of drawing trendlines, it's measuring the actual efficiency of price movements. Meanwhile, FCF Yield plays the role of your fundamental analyst who doesn't care about stories or projections - just cold, hard cash generation relative to price. When these two analysts agree, something interesting tends to happen.

**2. Technical Framework**

# 2.1 Universe Selection

Rather than simply picking the largest S&P 500 components, the strategy:

1. Filters constituents based on their weights in SPY
2. Sorts by weight to identify the top candidates
3. Selects from this filtered universe to ensure liquidity and representativeness

# 2.2 Position Sizing

Here's where things get sophisticated. Rather than equal weighting (which would be simpler), the strategy employs an optimized weighting scheme that:

1. Calculates z-scores for both KER and FCF Yield
2. Optimizes factor weights using the Nelder-Mead method
3. Generates portfolio weights proportional to the combined, optimized factor scores
4. Key detail: The optimization objective function is:-(np.dot(factor\_zscores, weights) \* trailing\_return).sum()

This means it's explicitly considering the interaction between factor scores and recent performance.

**3. The Factors: A Deeper Look**

# 3.1 Kaufman Efficiency Ratio (KER)

Let's talk about what KER really measures. Imagine you're walking through a city. You could measure the distance you've traveled in two ways:

1. The straight-line distance from start to finish (net directional movement)
2. The actual distance you walked following streets and turns (total price movement)

KER is essentially comparing these two measurements in price action. A high KER means price is moving efficiently in one direction - like taking a straight path through the city. A low KER means price is moving inefficiently - like wandering through back alleys.

Implementation detail from the code:

    Efficiency = abs(Close[n] - Close[0]) / Sum(abs(Close[i] - Close[i-1]))

The strategy calculates this over a 21-day lookback period by default.

# 3.2 Free Cash Flow Yield

FCF Yield might seem like a simple value metric, but its power lies in what it doesn't measure. Unlike earnings yields or other traditional value metrics, FCF Yield:

* Is harder to manipulate through accounting choices
* Captures actual cash-generating ability
* Naturally penalizes companies that require heavy ongoing capital investment
* Rewards capital-light businesses with strong market positions

**4. The Secret Sauce: Integration Method**

The integration of these factors involves several sophisticated steps that aren't immediately obvious:

4.1 Z-Score Normalization -  The code normalizes both factor values to z-scores, ensuring comparability across different scales:

    factor_zscores = (factors_df - factors_df.mean()) / factors_df.std()

4.2. Return Integration - A unique aspect is how the strategy incorporates trailing returns:

    trailing_return = price_df.pct_change(self._lookback-1).iloc[-1]

This creates a natural momentum overlay that helps confirm factor signals.

4.3 Optimization The Nelder-Mead optimization with bounds ensures:

* Factor weights remain between 0 and 1
* The solution maximizes factor effectiveness
* The weights adapt to changing market conditions

**5. Risk Management**

The strategy employs the following risk management layers:

1. **Position Concentration** By limiting selection to 5 positions, the strategy maintains focus while ensuring sufficient diversification.
2. **Monthly Rebalancing** Regular rebalancing ensures the portfolio doesn't drift from its intended factor exposures.

Note: While the code includes a trailing equity stop at 90% of peak equity, this feature is not used in the live implementation of the strategy.

**6. Why It Works: A Behavioral Perspective**

The strategy's effectiveness can be attributed to several behavioral factors:

1. **Efficiency Recognition** Markets tend to underreact to improvements in business efficiency. KER helps identify when this recognition is occurring in a sustained way.
2. **Quality Migration** High FCF Yield companies often experience gradual multiple expansion as their quality becomes more widely recognized.
3. **Momentum Confirmation** The integration of trailing returns helps confirm when the market is actively repricing these factors.

**7. Conclusion: Why This Matters**

The KEY 5 SPY Strategy represents a sophisticated yet implementable approach to portfolio rotation. Its success stems from:

1. The complementary nature of its chosen factors
2. Sophisticated factor integration and weighting
3. Sufficient risk management
4. Focus on highly liquid securities

More importantly, it demonstrates how combining traditional fundamental factors with technical efficiency measures can create a more robust investment process than either approach alone.

The strategy's use of optimization and factor integration techniques shows how modern quantitative methods can enhance traditional factor investing approaches while maintaining practicality and interpretability.

**Abstract**

This examines the KEY 5 SPY Strategy, an adaptive approach to portfolio rotation that combines technical efficiency measurement (KER - Kaufman Efficiency Ratio) with fundamental value assessment (FCF Yield) to select and weight positions among the S&P 500's top constituents. We explore both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation details that make this strategy particularly effective in real-world trading conditions.

**Hypothesis**

The strategy posits that combining price efficiency (KER) with fundamental value (FCF Yield) identifies stocks with sustainable momentum. By measuring how efficiently price moves alongside a company's ability to generate free cash flow, we can select securities where technical trend and fundamental strength reinforce each other. The strategy hypothesizes that optimally / adaptively weighting these factors within the most liquid S&P 500 constituents produces superior risk-adjusted returns compared to single-factor approaches.

**1. Introduction: Why This Strategy Matters**

Let's start with a simple truth: most strategies that look great in backtests fall apart in live trading. What makes the KEY 5 SPY Strategy different? The answer lies in its adaptive combination of two factors that complement each other in ways that might not be immediately obvious.

Think of KER as your technical analyst with a physics degree - instead of drawing trendlines, it's measuring the actual efficiency of price movements. Meanwhile, FCF Yield plays the role of your fundamental analyst who doesn't care about stories or projections - just cold, hard cash generation relative to price. When these two analysts agree, something interesting tends to happen.

**2. Technical Framework**

# 2.1 Universe Selection

Rather than simply picking the largest S&P 500 components, the strategy:

1. Filters constituents based on their weights in SPY
2. Sorts by weight to identify the top candidates
3. Selects from this filtered universe to ensure liquidity and representativeness

# 2.2 Position Sizing

Here's where things get sophisticated. Rather than equal weighting (which would be simpler), the strategy employs an optimized weighting scheme that:

1. Calculates z-scores for both KER and FCF Yield
2. Optimizes factor weights using the Nelder-Mead method
3. Generates portfolio weights proportional to the combined, optimized factor scores
4. Key detail: The optimization objective function is:-(np.dot(factor\_zscores, weights) \* trailing\_return).sum()

This means it's explicitly considering the interaction between factor scores and recent performance.

**3. The Factors: A Deeper Look**

# 3.1 Kaufman Efficiency Ratio (KER)

Let's talk about what KER really measures. Imagine you're walking through a city. You could measure the distance you've traveled in two ways:

1. The straight-line distance from start to finish (net directional movement)
2. The actual distance you walked following streets and turns (total price movement)

KER is essentially comparing these two measurements in price action. A high KER means price is moving efficiently in one direction - like taking a straight path through the city. A low KER means price is moving inefficiently - like wandering through back alleys.

Implementation detail from the code:

    Efficiency = abs(Close[n] - Close[0]) / Sum(abs(Close[i] - Close[i-1]))

The strategy calculates this over a 21-day lookback period by default.

# 3.2 Free Cash Flow Yield

FCF Yield might seem like a simple value metric, but its power lies in what it doesn't measure. Unlike earnings yields or other traditional value metrics, FCF Yield:

* Is harder to manipulate through accounting choices
* Captures actual cash-generating ability
* Naturally penalizes companies that require heavy ongoing capital investment
* Rewards capital-light businesses with strong market positions

**4. The Secret Sauce: Integration Method**

The integration of these factors involves several sophisticated steps that aren't immediately obvious:

4.1 Z-Score Normalization -  The code normalizes both factor values to z-scores, ensuring comparability across different scales:

    factor_zscores = (factors_df - factors_df.mean()) / factors_df.std()

4.2. Return Integration - A unique aspect is how the strategy incorporates trailing returns:

    trailing_return = price_df.pct_change(self._lookback-1).iloc[-1]

This creates a natural momentum overlay that helps confirm factor signals.

4.3 Optimization The Nelder-Mead optimization with bounds ensures:

* Factor weights remain between 0 and 1
* The solution maximizes factor effectiveness
* The weights adapt to changing market conditions

**5. Risk Management**

The strategy employs the following risk management layers:

1. **Position Concentration** By limiting selection to 5 positions, the strategy maintains focus while ensuring sufficient diversification.
2. **Monthly Rebalancing** Regular rebalancing ensures the portfolio doesn't drift from its intended factor exposures.

Note: While the code includes a trailing equity stop at 90% of peak equity, this feature is not used in the live implementation of the strategy.

**6. Why It Works: A Behavioral Perspective**

The strategy's effectiveness can be attributed to several behavioral factors:

1. **Efficiency Recognition** Markets tend to underreact to improvements in business efficiency. KER helps identify when this recognition is occurring in a sustained way.
2. **Quality Migration** High FCF Yield companies often experience gradual multiple expansion as their quality becomes more widely recognized.
3. **Momentum Confirmation** The integration of trailing returns helps confirm when the market is actively repricing these factors.

**7. Conclusion: Why This Matters**

The KEY 5 SPY Strategy represents a sophisticated yet implementable approach to portfolio rotation. Its success stems from:

1. The complementary nature of its chosen factors
2. Sophisticated factor integration and weighting
3. Sufficient risk management
4. Focus on highly liquid securities

More importantly, it demonstrates how combining traditional fundamental factors with technical efficiency measures can create a more robust investment process than either approach alone.

The strategy's use of optimization and factor integration techniques shows how modern quantitative methods can enhance traditional factor investing approaches while maintaining practicality and interpretability.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same.

1ghp2b7_O,O,Spy Intraday Analysis - 2/28/23 - 11/01/24,"Been compiling highs and lows I ready on SPY for awhile now and just created this table this week showing the potential outcomes of where the highs and lows will hit during the day. 

First table (master table): shows how many  times a specific time range held its respective high of day (HOD) and low of day (LOD).  As you can see, everything is color coded. The most common scenario is a LOD between 9:30-10:30 and a HOD between 3:01-4:00; specifically 71 times this has occurred in the last 424 trading days. This goes in hand with the bottom/last table that reflects the percentages/liklihood to occur.


The second table shows an even more specific breakdown. Let’s say you are confident we’ve hit the HOD at 10:40 for the day. This second table gives you additional insight on which timeframe you LOD is likely to hit. For example, let’s say it’s 11:30 in the morning and our current LOD is when market opened at 9:30 (and we hit our HOD at 10:40) we may assess that we won’t hit a new LOD because there’s a 31.58% chance that it’ll remain in that timeframe (9:30-10:30) OR you may assess we could hit a new LOD later on in the day as historical support shows that we have a 15.79%, 13.16%, 13.16%, and 26.32% (the timeframes we haven’t gotten to yet). 

The third table is the same concept as the second table but it’s just the opposite and focuses on LOD.

This of course doesn’t show you the whole picture as price action, news, volume, and many other things play a part of how SPY moves. But I do plan on using this to guide me in my conviction for future trades

If the stock rises I keep rolling up for credit if the stock goes down I roll and collect credit and profit.

1g5zc7r_SPY,SPY,Using a Machine Learning Model of Daily SPY Volatility to Predict Increases in SPY (Part 2),"First post: [Machine Learning and Daily Realized Volatility in SPY](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1g49lvz/machine_learning_and_daily_realized_volatility_in/)

In my first post, I presented the results of a machine learning model that is effective in predicting daily volatility in SPY (by categorizing changes from the open as above or below 0.7%). After analyzing the model some more, I've found that it is also predictive of whether the price of SPY will go up at least 0.4% from that day's open (chosen as it is the median of my dateset from 2009 to present). it's important to note I don't mean *close* 0.4% above the day's open, I mean that the model is effective in predicting whether SPY will increase *at some point during the day*. 

This information can be effective in buying calls, of vertical spreads depending on the prediction.

As a reminder, the previous model predicted the maximum swing in the price of SPY relative to that day's opening. By categorizing the predictions into above/below 0.7%, we were able to get an accuracy of \~74% (far better than the 52% guess rate).

Using that same model and same threshold (0.7%) the model is able to predict with an accuracy of 67% overall (far better than the 46% guess rate) whether SPY will increase by 0.4% at some point during the day. **In other words, when the model's predicted volatility is above 0.7%, there has been a 0.4% increase in SPY at some point during the day 67% of the time.** Overall the model is 67% accurate in predicting whether SPY will increase by 0.4% or not (much higher than the guess rate of 54%). These and additional details can be found in the screenshot of the confusion matrix below.

[Confusion Matrix for Predicting Increases in SPY](https://preview.redd.it/kxzg1aqv9dvd1.png?width=374&format=png&auto=webp&s=0070f68c90cf8b778e60043455b93a0bf1ef8750)

When examining the accuracy by year, we see fairly consistent accuracy with respect to predicting increases over 0.4%.

https://preview.redd.it/s12cvg51cdvd1.png?width=255&format=png&auto=webp&s=f082f27ba0d77184f781b0f3909ecc351daa8f99

Additionally, when examining average increases in SPY for days where the price is predicted to go over 0.4%, the **average increase is 0.84%**, relative to 0.35% on days where the price is not predicted to go over 0.4%.

To summarize, the model to predict whether SPY's volatility will be above/below 0.7% for any given day is also useful in predicting whether the price of SPY will increase 0.4% at some point during the day. This can be effective in strategies to buy 0DTE SPY calls, or vertical spreads, etc.

I'm happy to hear people's thoughts about the usefulness of this model. I'm also happy to answer any questions people may have.

10x Spy Put @ 450 December 19, 2025

I believe that the US Labor market and US consumer are currently much weaker than what is being indicated by the media/FEDs at this time. Interest rates are going to fall very rapidly over the next year in attempt to prop up the labor market, and influence greater consumer credit spending. I do not believe this will work because of the present state of the average US consumer. Lowering interest rates can't help consumers who already don't have any sheckles.

The American consumer is completely broke and over levered, and additionally we are trending towards a tightening labor market, as corporations have been laying off more frequently due to over hiring during the pandemic, job openings are trending down, and unemployment is on the rise. I believe in the next 12-24 months we are going to bear witness to a Consumer Led Recession. For those of you that have made it this far, allow me to explain with some graphs.

**Saving Rates**  
""Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences""

US savings rates are at the same levels we experienced in the 2008 financial crisis, currently last reported at 2.9%. This means the American consumer has only been able to save 2.9% of their earnings towards their retirement, or to buy houses. In the second graph we can see this is trending downwards even still since COVID, as wages have not kept up with the high levels of inflation.

**YoY Household Expenditure**

Year-over-year household expenditures have up-ticked dramatically since the COVID bucks were printed. The average increase YoY change in Household Expenditures has historically been 3.074% since 1984 (close the average inflation rate in the US of 3.25% since 1973). The problem here arises in the second picture below. Household expenditures rose by 8.361% in 2021 and 8.276% in 2022, which is back-to-back years outside of 1 standard deviation away from the mean, highlighted as 5.693%. Tomorrow at 10:00 AM the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release their 2023 Household Expenditures data, it would not be shocking that 2023 was another above-average year, as the average inflation rate for that year was 4.1%.

**Unemployment**

Not much to say here, except the graph has begun moving upwards in the last 12-months.

**Job Openings**

Not much to say here, other than again Job Openings are trending downwards, albeit still above the average Job Openings rate (orange).

**Delinquency Rates Consumer Loans**

Here's where we get interesting again, Consumer Loan Delinquency rates are now currently above levels in 2011 and have continued to trend upwards in our heightened interest rate environment. This may infer two things: consumers have not changed their spending habits, or have become over levered. Orange line indicates the average since 1987.

**Delinquency Rates Credit Cards**

Delinquency rates on Credit cards are saying the exact same thing as consumer loans. Trending upwards, and above levels since 2011 in the era of low interest rates and lessened inflation.  
What I WILL say is that delinquencies on mortgages have not risen much, but that is an indicator than I am aggressively watching QoQ.

**US Deposits**

Deposits on checking, time and savings accounts for households are all going down and are currently all **BELOW** levels in 2019. This is indicating that consumers are currently being forced to draw on their savings previously established from the pandemic to survive, or keep up with their perceived levels of consumer spending. This is also inline with what you can hear from retailers, like Amazon, Walmart or fast-food businesses. Customers are becoming more ""value-orientated"", as they look for ways for their dollars to go further. [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html) is a great read from multiple earnings calls that highlight this.

All data I've presented is publicly available from the US FED or BLS. DYOD.

tl;dr US Consumer is broke. GDP may continue to grow but at a snails pace since consumers have no money to spend lavishly. Savings are going down and delinquencies are going up. Large credit risk, liquidity risks, and geopolitical risks are present.

1fkuerz_SPY,SPY,Bullish Divergence on $SPY this AM. Where do you think we’re heading?,"Two things I saw here today early this morning. 

Quick sell off to the 200ma which I always monitor closely for my positions, and at the same time you see a clear difference in the chart compared to the TSI at the bottom. 

We have lower lows on both, but the TSI is showing to be more flat across compared to the angle on the chart. Now typically I always look for another confirmation when I see this, and with price not being able to break below the 200ma, that was what I needed to see. 

 I waited for it to break back above that level, as well as VWAP and took $572 calls to the house for 30%. 

These are very simple things to implement especially for those needing more visual confirmations.

If the economy crashes, there is no chance Kamala gets elected. The public will shift their gaze to a more authoritative business person, Donald Trump. 

It is my humble belief that J pow will bless us with a calm, confident, and data-focused .25 base point rate cut.

1f9vyvb_SPY,SPY,Who Else Caught This Move on $SPY?,"Do you see the pattern? Another bearish divergence that played out perfectly near the $554 level. 

Let me share a couple rules I have learned to follow over the past few years. 

1. Don’t trade before 10:30am (1 hour after market open. - This eliminates the higher volatility and usually is able to pick a more profound direction. 

2. Only take trades off of good setups. - This divergence is a good example of a good setup. You have a clear picture where you can place your stop loss (right above the high) and place the trade. Also breaking VWAP, and the 200ma are good places to trade as well. 

3. Set percentage goals on your position size. I NEVER look at the percentage of my account gain, I only look at the percentage that my position size gain is. My usual PT is 30%. Looking at it from this standpoint in my opinion helps grow your account much more consistently. 

Those are just a few things I follow to a T. I definitely encourage everyone to start looking for these types of divergences and just sticking to a strategy instead of flip flopping around which is where most go wrong. 

Stop looking for the home run, baby steps!

1f7qh3k_SPY,SPY,Does anyone actually hold SPY long term?,"My uncle (65) and I were talking after his fathers funeral and he's trying to figure out why his father (who died at 95),  was holding only 1 ETF, SPY.

We've met several ""shady"" people who are willing to ""exchange"" (as in something like 1031) the assets in return for a ""fee"".

In any case, while that discussion continues on, I wanted to know does anyone actually hold SPY long term (outside my uncle's father)?

The theory right now is that he invested in SPY when it was launched due to his connection with Boston Life Insurance companies or something, reinvested the dividends and the rest is history.

For those of you not familiar with divergences, this is a hidden bearish divergence. You can see clearly that the chart is showing a clear difference in direction compared to the TSI oscillator on the bottom. These clear differences are some of the best trades to take especially for a quick turnaround. 

You can also confirm these directions by adding the TTM Squeeze indicator and the Ultimate Oscillator, if you get the same confirmations on all 3… Even better. 

I confirm these divergences with the sell signal from TO, meaning I don’t take the trade unless a signal is fired. I recommend everyone to look into this, even if you don’t use signals, these are great trades to look for, and high probability.

1ej6svn_O,O,$505 possible on the SPY and here is why. Hate to be that guy but here is the situation.,"Hi guys,

I hate to be that guy but being a realist and there is a gap fill that is possible at the $505 level. We may see some relief bounces but may retrace in the coming month to the .382 level before starting a new uptrend. This would be a 10.6% correction from the 565.16 top. Last year's correction was 10.9%. Food for thought and something to be on the lookout for. If we breach $528, $505 is the next key level. We are in a downtrend and to reclaim the current uptrend, need a $544 capture and hold. Lastly, we are under critical 9 and 20 day EMAs so it's no man's land right now.

I saw a bit of panic this week after a few down days but those who have been in the game for more than a few years will know this is just drawdown for ants.

3. If you’re not feeling it, don’t trade

I've come up with the following strategy, and any input on any potential issues or areas for optimization is greatly appreciated:

1. When QQQ's EMA 10 and EMA 20 have a golden cross and EMA 20 crosses above EMA 144 (uptrend), buy several deep ITM QQQ calls with a 3-month expiration and sell on the last day. If it breaks below EMA 144 in the meantime, stop-loss.
2. When QQQ's EMA 10 and EMA 20 have a golden cross above EMA 144 (uptrend), buy several deep ITM QQQ calls with a 3-month expiration and sell on the last day. If it breaks below the recent support, stop-loss.
3. When QQQ's EMA 10 and EMA 20 have a death cross and EMA 10 crosses below EMA 144 (downtrend), buy several deep ITM QQQ puts with a 1-month expiration and sell on the last day. If it breaks above EMA 144 in the meantime, stop-loss.
4. When QQQ's EMA 10 and EMA 20 have a death cross below EMA 144 (downtrend), buy several deep ITM QQQ puts with a 1-month expiration and sell on the last day. If it breaks above the recent resistance, stop-loss.

Are the EMA 10, 20, and 144 parameters reasonable, or would MA be better? Would other periods be better? Are there other indicators I should consider?

I have been trading SPY only for about 3 months now and will make the switch to IWM (most likely) after conducting further research.

When looking at  IWM as an alternative, although it is smaller and not as volatile, dollar wise, it does appear to be more reliable when it comes to options pricing  and more reasonable on decay when the priceoves against you as it does not decline as fast even on options close to or slightly ITM. This will keep you in a trade longer relative to where you thiNk the mark might be.

Although more analysis needs to be done on IWM, the overall price movement, (in general) seems less volatile in the very short term. You can see how disruptive SPY gets when short term trading.

The style of trading I aim for are to capture larger moves over a longer period, although not hold overnight, I want to capture trending days. Not to scalp on the 1-min. And IWM seems to fit that better as a trading instrument.

After a week of paying close attention on its movement, I've started trading actively from the week of 4/8. (For the days that I had $0, I either had other things to work on or simply wasn't able to to trade.)

[ Weekly and Monthly P\/L ](https://preview.redd.it/2fulrob5xvwc1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=423daff72b8cab3e4286e8cfc2eab7ae8fc8c3a4)

My strategy was simple. Invest about $1000 - $1500 per trade. Cutting losses at the pre-defined percentage and exiting whenever I was profitable. My RR was 1:1.5 (20%/30%) and I tried to stick to this strategy as much as possible without getting my emotions involved.

Below is the spreadsheet of trades that I've made along the journey. As you can see it on the Actual Profit/Loss columns (column S and T), there were times where I held onto the losses for little too long but for the majority of the time, I've managed to cut losses whenever I was down \~20% range.

[ Trades I made for 0dte on SPY ](https://preview.redd.it/cfppvaz7xvwc1.png?width=2055&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35343dd0b7c93a18173c7d64a9c95023215c24c)

For when to exit, I sold half of the investment whenever I was up around 30%, locking in that profit and let the rest of the half run after adjusting the stop loss at a higher point (so that I would still end up making a little bit of money even if the stock goes down. If it runs higher, even better, I'm not missing out on the runs as I still have half of my investment in it.) I've had countless number of times where I was being greedy and ended up going negative at the end so ""***minimizing the loss and not being too greedy***"" was pretty much what I was aiming for. Nobody goes broke being positive, right?

For indicators, I've only used VWAP, 20/50/100 MA. Nothing else. (Of course you need to be looking at the volume as well as support and resistance lines.) I've tried many different indicators throughout my years of trading experience but keeping my chart simple has worked the best for me.

I know that 3 weeks is an extremely short amount of time to show & prove anything but let me know your thoughts on 0dtes. Do you think it's a sustainable business? For now, I think I will continue to trade 0dtes as I am profitable and see where I would end up after a few months. I will post an update if anyone's interested. Thank you all!

TLDR: I tried 0dte for about 3 weeks and was profitable!

Inspired by  
Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book ""Skin In The Game""

1. The book explains why you should put more trust in someone that has something to lose from their actions than from someone who risks nothing.
2. Owner-operated companies have skin in the game, thus making interests aligned with outside investors.
3. Family-owned companies can serve as a proxy, and they seem to outperform the market.
4. Many large caps can be labelled as family-owned/managed: Berkshire, Google/Alphabet, Amazon

I even get the thesis, keep the top 500 companies in the portfolio. 

What i don’t understand is how it maintains that without bleeding capital. Wouldnt it constantly be selling off its poorest performers at lows, and buying new stocks at all time highs?

1aucumh_PATH,PATH,NVIDIA.SPY.SPX How I trade Options using Elliott Wave,"This is an Elliott Wave analysis on how I approach the market.

**The key question the market will answer this week:** 

1. Are we in wave iv of circle (c)? (highest probability) 

2. Are we already in wave v of circle (c)? (lower probability) 

3. Are we still extending in wave iii? ( lowest probability) 

**My primary count has us in wave iv, let's see what we can expect from the market based on this premise.** 

The move down off the high in the last 2 hours of trading on Friday looks to be a 1/2 setup, if this is the operative count, then we can expect the market to continue downward in a direct fashion targeting the 4968-4961 (zone 1) to 4961-4934 (zone 2) SPX region. 

What the market does from this region (zone 1/zone 2) will tell us whether the move completed as a running flat (meaning the market will not break the low established on 2/13 @ 4920 in the immediate present). 

&#x200B;

 **BUT... OR...** 

The move to 4968-4961(zone 1) can also be a bigger wave 1 and if that's the case, then the market should retrace back upward in a **corrective manner** toward the 5000-5010 region (resistance area). 

From there we would get a sizable move down toward the 4870-4851 SPX region. 

&#x200B;

 **HOW DO I TRADE THIS WITH ALL OF THESE IF'S?** 

You can buy short term PUTS targeting SPY 495/494 region. 

The market should bounce from this region before deciding on whether to continue making ATH or breaking down further. The way prices move thereafter will tell me what the market is likely to do with a high probability. 

***I have 495 PUTS purchased last Wednesday. I will exit either Tuesday or Wednesday depending on what prices do.*** 

**HOW DOES THIS PRICE ACTION LINE UP WITH NVIVIA AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WILL HAPPEN?** 

I’m expecting a wave (iv) pullback in NVIDIA that should hold above 622. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aztzhbvffgjc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=213d638c887e604ebe00dbf923d4cff096b1f0ed

 **Scenario 1** 

The price action on the SPX between Tuesday and Wednesday will be a telling sign, if the market reaches my target region in the 4968-4961 to 4961-4934 by Tuesdays' close or during RTH on Wednesday, then I expect NVIDIA will continue to extend. 

**I'm using the SPX price action to help with NVIDIA because NVIDIA has extended beyond what is considered normal projections from its low in October.** 

**Scenario 2** 

The market reaches the 4968-4961 region by Tuesday's close. Starts the next bounce. The market nears the resistance region of 5000-5010 after moving in a **corrective manner** by Wednesday’s close. 

This price action to me suggests NVIDIA is going to drop the market down and our bigger 1/2 is playing out on the SPX. PUTS on both NVIDIA and SPY. 

This analysis (Elliot wave) must be performed daily to get closer and closer to discovering the highest path (probability) the market is likely to take. I will know more about these paths on Tuesday afternoon and still more on Wednesday midday during RTH. ",2024-02-19,1,2

I plan on maxing out or as close as I can to maxing my current 401k moving forward. Outside of that I finally decided to open an account on fidelity.

It’s been overwhelming but am excited to get this going and appreciate any help :)",2024-02-02,0,9

I cross-check this with the csv I obtained via the API, and it is indeed showing these weird datapoints. For example, the 'low' on this candle is almost 30 points below the open/high etc which is quite unlikely and probably a data error/issue.

I pulled the data everyday including weekends. Depending on how you use the data you will need to remove weekend data(the weekend data is just the close data from Friday). Also occasionally a data request failed and files ended up with a size of 0 kb. The file might also need to be removed if I hadn’t gotten them all already.

&#x200B;

The H4 MACD histogram indicates the minor down trend is slowing down. The MACD on H2 is going to cross over soon. I will watch this over the coming week and look for a sign that the MACD will cross over on the H4 soon as price is nearing the 0.5 fib level. If I find added confluence on the H2 I will go long and hold the trade either to the middle or top bollinger band. 

Any suggestions or comments regarding this setup are more than welcome :)

I’m also aware if I sell spy I’ll have to pay taxes on my capital appreciation which could strip some of the reinvestment into voo. For these reasons I’m curious as to if I should sell one of the two or hold both. Thank you,2023-12-28,0,5

18pyqeq_SPY,SPY,Why not use index future /ES for leverage instead of a margin loan for holding 2x SPY?,"I doubled my returns when the interest rates were 0% by leveraging 2x using margin loans. Those margin loans are quite expensive these days with IB at 6% rate.  It looks like I can leverage 2x easily by longing /ES future contracts and keep rolling them over before expiration. And I don't have to pay any interest for this leverage. It almost sounds too good to be true. What am I missing here? I know leverage is a double edge sword and I never exceed 2x even though you can easily leverage 18x or more with futures contracts.

It also seems like I can earn interest on the cash that is not invested in SPY.  Say if I wanted to invest $240k in SPY, I mean I need to lock up all $240k by buying SPY. But instead I can invest all that cash in T Bills and buy one /ES contract if I have portfolio margin. That gives me exposure to S&P 500 while earning 5% on treasuries. So why would anyone buy SPY then? They could just invest in /ES or /MES and free up cash and invest in money market or treasuries.",2023-12-24,13,15

18dhwii_SPY,SPY,Did the 4x Leverage SPY ETF ($XXXX) guy make sense?,"so if you see this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18c8ia7/xxxx_is_now_available_4x_leverage_sp500/), the theory is that if you invested 1/4th in a 4x leveraged SPY ETF and hold onto remaining cash, buying more with the excess cash if you go too low, could you beat SPY? I tested this in a quick [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138W03zVTe2ajZFaCoWKZkJcJbHG5aDquHD4ggU38yIg/edit#gid=0) calculation, please help poke holes. 

Here's what I did:

* Starting with $100k, I compare a 100% lumpsum SPY investment with a 25% $XXXX investment.
* Theoretically, daily returns on 25% $XXXX investment and 75% cash should give you the same daily yield as lumpsum $SPY. 
* The $25k is re-evaluated every 6 months, and if we are below $25k, cash is used to buy $XXXX to come back up to $25k. This is used till we run out of cash.
* Comparing daily returns from 1/1/2000 to date, there is a significantly higher return using $XXXX. 
* $SPY includes DRIP, $XXXX does not. 1% annual expense decay on $XXXX and 3% cash APY is assumed.
* As a point of comparison, I also added a 100% lumpsum $XXXX ETF. As expected, this does not perform as well as $SPY.


Please tell me why I'm wrong, would love to have a discussion.",2023-12-08,46,34

Now near 460, it's entirely possible the same thing happens at this level, but there are some things to keep an eye out for that could signal a pickup in vol. The first would be any sign of two-way moves. The SPX/SPY is currently in the midst of a historic run that has only seen 1 day the red of more than 0.5% in the past month. So clearly any move lower more than that, particularly one that sees an acceleration over a few days of larger moves lower would probably be a signal of a little bit of volatiliy returning. The other would be to the upside. It's worth keeping an eye on Russell 2000 / IWM as that has been showing some signs the past week of playing catchup to the move in QQQ. On Friday IWM was up nearly 3%. And IWM vol, as measured by the RVX was up 2%. That sort of rising stocks, with rising IV condition is noteworthy if it turns from more of a rotation from mega cap to small cap into FOMO buying and froth, with the potential that investors start reaching for out of the money calls.

The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

184lkd7_WDAY,WDAY,"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.","SPY/SPX was higher by about 1% in holiday-shortened trading last week, slightly more than what options were pricing. The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks. If we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant, and, there's a decent amount of economic data and Fedspeak.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

Up through the reversal back up over the last 2 days I had had 3 straight weeks of gains (200 - 210%), but I'm not sure where to go from here. My TA says Spy should drop but interest rates may drop, don't know where we are going in the short-term for a number of reasons, and I try not to play expensive premium options, when possible. I trade on extrinsic value (when I'm ITM). Outside of Apple's earnings, which I personally think will be bearish, I'm feeling a bit burnt out and like I need to tap a new vein of the market. I know this is a broud post with no real direction, but I would love some feedback on some ideas of how to continue my upward momentum. I don't want to get hyperfixate (as I usually do, super ADD) and play Spy as it trades sideways / up, in the short-term. I could just sit on my hands...
Im long (20 years) on 40,000 shares of Goog A/C (26k / 14k)  that I could write covered calls / puts on, but, honestly, haven't done that before, and, there are some other financial considerations I'd have to think about. I know there are other assets/commodities/etc to play out there, but I would love to hear any feedback on which areas of the market to turn to next / opinions on TV/LA learning curve, usage, and all the other things I mentioned in my little post.

179impc_SPY,SPY,"Does majority rule for intraday price movements? (QQQ / SPY, money flowing in favor of increase & decrease)","Daytrading QQQ and SPY based on majority rules tactic.

Does majority opinion rule for intra-day trading?

Little bit of an opinion piece here.

I like to web scrape. I’ve been scraping trades placed on Kalshi throughout the day, which is an event-based trading platform.

I’m focusing on two events: where the NASDAQ will close and where the SPY will close for the current trading day.

By tracking money placed in favor of price increases and money placed in favor of price deceases - I’d like to trade with the majority.

This is an elementary train of thought - stemming from my days playing kahoot in elementary school.

No matter the question (ie it could have been as random as our teacher’s summer vacation), the majority opinion of the class was almost always correct.

I know that Kalshi is limited in the opinions it’s collecting, but how do people feel about this - especially if it had 100x the traffic/scope?

Is the money flowing in favor and against SPY and QQQ a result of the past price changes, or are people viewing said change and voting on where they think the stock will head next?",2023-10-16,11,11

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

https://preview.redd.it/71ypjsocddtb1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd16f07f8fa9b516525dbd24eca8bb8427b5f0dc

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

As of now the JPM collar has officially rolled and here it is… now keep in mind that this does sometimes get slightly adjusted by Monday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j65bm6df79rb1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dd02fbf0190bb9c01df4ca250420cc8848b2ea5

As of now we are looking at

Short call 4500  
 Long put 4050  
 Short put 3410

Now to keep this simple what do you need to know about the JPM collar? Not much to be honestly but in generally in my experience we will maintain our price action somewhere between 4050 and 4500 till it rolls again. It is very notable that the collar was rolled below the previous collar. 

While the collar is clearly not made to be directional trade it is notable that we should expect 4500 or 4050 (if not both) to be touched before EOY. With 4050 SPX being below the high of year I would not expect any new ATHS this year at all… Based off this my expectation actually is that we will see SPX break into the 3900s before EOY. 

**Government shutdown**

Its obviously not a super common thing to have a true government shutdown…. And this is not to be political as im only talking about what SPY did… 

2 out of the 3 last shut downs the week before we closed red (spy is closing red barely this week)  
 2 out of 3 times the first day the market was open of the shutdown we closed green actually   
 3 out of 3 times we closed green the day the shutdown ended  
 3 out of 3 times the total movement from shutdown to opening was green  
 2 out of 3 times the week after the shutdown ended was green. 

Buy the dip?

Next week is gonna be another data heavy week. We are looking at JPOW himself speaking yet again Monday at 11am… yesterdays education session was a massive nothing burger. 

JOLTS on Tuesday, ADP/ PMI Wednesday, challenger jobs and unemployment claims Thursday and then unemployment rate on Friday… that is a ton of data that will be very interesting to watch how markets react. The bigger one to watch is UE on Friday… if we see that UE rate drop then we can expect even more pain from JPOW.

We were finally able to get back to the 430.4 demand and take that level out… however, we hard rejected off the daily 8ema and also over 432.22 supply. 

Interestingly enough the daily DMI is already nearing overbought and we remain in extreme bear momentum. 

Short under 425.76 with a target of 417.79 and long over 432.22 with a target of 436.2/79.

While we did break through the year long daily bull channel support… we are still holding our weekly bull channel support. That support for next week will sit at 422.66 which is just over this weeks low. 

We took our 427.35 supply this week also. 

We have closed a full candle below the weekly 8/20ema supports for the first time since December 2022. We did have a really hard bounce off that weekly 50ema support though. 

From here we have upside targets at 433.04 to 437.62 and downside targets of 416.08 to 411.57. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 416.08 -> 450.95

Futures also pumped enough to take out that 4362 demand and had a really hard rejection off the daily 8ema resistance. 

Short under 4319 with target of 4273/ 4240 and long over 4384 with target of 4458.

Futures came down and took out 4284 supply. With that drop we perfectly bounced off the year long bull channel support line. That weekly support sits at 4292 for next week. 

Both spy and futures weekly candles are dojis which certainly could lead to a potential upside reversal. 

Bulls need to get this back over 4385 minimally and bears want a closure under 4260 for downside continuation.

Looking at QQQ here we did have a pretty large breakout to take out 362.01 demand. But we had a pretty massive failed breakout and rejection off the daily 8ema to close back under that level. 

The daily continues to fight and pivot around the 100ema support/ resistance. 

Long over 359.71 with target of 372… short under 354.13 with target of 347.93/ 349.06.

QQQ weekly is already through its year long bull channel support and now I would say is in an official downtrend since July. 

This weekly doji here certainly has the potential to an upside reversal here, however, we closed beneath the weekly 8 and 20ema support. 

359.48 and 365.12 will be major resistance to watch. There actually are no levels I have here from 330.67 to 359.48. My downside target would be weekly 50ema near 338.38.

Taking a look at VIX here I actually would be far more bearish on Monday than just looking at spy/ qqq daily. The VIX came down and had an incredibly hard bounce off the daily 20ema support line to come all the way back up and defend the 16.9 demand on the daily. 

What I find very impressive and all telling here is that the VIX is back to 17.56 while SPY is back to 427.48. The VIX essentially is $2 lower than it was the last time SPY was here which certainly means a run back to 18.95/ 19.56 could bring heavy downside. 

IF VIX breaks and closes over 18.95/19.56 then I would fully expect much more downside on SPY, however, if the VIX can close under 16.9 then we are likely to see another attempt at a relief rally. ",2023-09-29,4,3

Last week I expected that we could see a possible Monday and Tuesday relief rally followed by heavy selling into the EOW. We only got the Monday bounce and today ended up as a very big bear day mostly related to a few speaker last night saying we likely will get another rate hike before EOY and JPM releasing an article saying we could see the federal funds rate hit 7% (that would be 7 more 25 bps hikes FYI).

I actually was expecting a continuation day to the upside to test the daily 100 ema resistance today, however, we actually started a next leg down… We have officially reached the critical and bulls last stand… the daily 200ema support. IF we lose and hold under the daily 200ema support this sell off is likely to turn into a major correction. 

Today we not only broke through the short term bear channel support (making this an even more extreme sell off) but we broke through the longer bear channel support too… This green support line you are seeing is the bull channel support for the year long bull channel we have been in…. that support sits at 424.5 tomorrow… if we break that effectively the bull move is over and we can start to look at an official bear trend. 

We took out supply at 428.06 today and put in a new supply at 432.22. 

Our next support is 422.04.

Much like SPY futures took out the 4312 supply today and put in a new supply at 4384. Looking at futures here we have clearly established the daily 100ema as resistance and now we will see if the daily 200ema can be defended as last stand for the bulls. 

One really interesting thing to me is the fact that the daily DMI has been 100% oversold (flat lined at 0… meaning litereally cant even move any further down) for 5 days now… over the last two years the longest we ever saw the DMI flat lined oversold or overbought was 4 days. There is a ton of momentum to this selling and we are entering extreme bear momentum. 

An extensive sell off into the EOY is shaping up here.

Now one notable difference in QQQ from SPY/ Futes is that the daily DMI actually is in a wave up process while we are falling. Until today QQQ had been holding the daily 100ema as support and actually was looking fairly stable compared to SPY. Today the 100ema officially became resistance. Tech in my opinion has still not fully joined in the sell off… once they do is when we start to see capitulation and 2-2.5% red days. 

QQQ next major support area is 347.93/349.06.

I know a lot of people don’t understand why I still follow the VIX or why I do supply/ demand on the VIX… however, more times than not the VIX remains helpful and on point. Today the VIX led the selloff… I mentioned last week that until we closed over 17.2/17.91 supply on the VIX daily we would not see the next leg down… today the VIX finally not only broke it but closed over it and put in a new demand at 16.9.

If the VIX breaks and closes over 19.56 we start the next leg down (likely under 200ema) if the VIX breaks and closes over 22.67… we are looking at full on capitulation and some extremely bloody days in this market. 

Anything over 26.17 and I would not be surprised to see SPY re-enter a bear market. ",2023-09-26,7,8

After a very hawk Powell spoke yesterday and basically told the market that there was a ton of uncertainty and set up a bearish dot plot… I expect blood to be in the water today… I am however a little surprised by how well market held up all day long… until power hour markets maintained a $2.5 range and finally broke a $3 range into power hour…. 

The question is now… what comes next? Do we continue to bleed or was this just a one off day? Depending on where the weekly closes tomorrow… we could be setting up for an extremely bearish end of month.

Something no one is talking about right now is the JPM collar… now anyone who has followed me for a long time knows I love the collar and love the weeks leading into the collar… we have a tendency to finish either near the long put (4215) or the short calls (4670)… as of right now… we are only about 3.9% away from the puts… for those of you that don’t know the Collar will roll on September 29th. 

I would not be surprised to see us drop into the collars puts next week. 

Something that is still mind blowing to me is that we have not had a -2% day since February 21st… actually that’s as far as I can tell our only -2%+ day all year which considering we had a whole bank run fiasco in March is incredible.

The daily here is beyond extreme bear… WE not only broke through the daily 100ema but we closed a full candle below the daily 100ema support for the first time since March 2015. 

Now I will say we are 100% oversold on the daily DMI so there is definitely a need for a bounce here but we are also approaching extreme bear momentum here on the daily now. 

We are well below our 436.2 and 436.79 double demand and we actually came down to at the very last second to touch the 431.37 demand. 

From a weekly stand point here if we close under 437.62 I am bearish for next week… if we close under 433.04 then I am extremely bearish for next week and I would be looking for the low 420s to be retested. Realistically bulls need to get this back over the 437.62 minimum. 

If this plays out like June and repeats that pattern we likely will close in the 420s for the first time since the beginning of June.

From a daily stand point here on futures the fact that we are going to close under the 4374/4383 triple demand area is incredibly bearish. Honestly I am very surprised we were able to get that low and not only that but close under it. With a daily closure under the 100ema now and that triple demand area our sights are set on 4292 to 4312.

Now again the daily DMI is 100% oversold and that does warrant a potential bounce… but I would expect that bounce to be very short lived. 

The next major target is the daily 200ema which is 4285.

From a weekly stand point anything under 4381 is very bearish and bulls minimally need to close over 4395.

Taking a look at QQQ here we did manage to break through and close under the daily 100ema support also. We also broke through our double demand/ support area at 358.53/ 362.01. With that being broken through we should start to target 347.93 to 349.06 double demand area. 

Much like SPY the Qs is 100% oversold on daily DMI but it also is approaching extreme bear momentum. 

From a weekly stand point the Qs need to minimally close under 359.48 to be bearish and the bulls minimally need it over 359.48.

The VIX had one heck of a day today… WE managed to finally take out our 15.96 demand. 

I am not sure if you guys caught the opening 30-45 minutes of oddity… on the VIX we were holding near 15.8 area and then on a one minute candle we saw the VIX flush to 15.1 LOD and then in the next 15 minute candle had push and recovered almost a full 10%... it was incredibly odd… 

Again I am not one to call manipulation as I just think 99.99% of the time traders use that as an excuse to why they were wrong instead of just admitting their trade failed… but the fact that we had a 10 point ($1) long 15min DOJI rejection candle on SPY and at the same time the VIX was doing all of its oddity… tells me that something bigger happened behind the scenes. 

That flash down on the VIX was enough to stop the momentum which then led to a full day of consolidation. 

For the time of momentum we carried and just overall selling we saw today (And volume 137% of 30day average) the fact that SPY held inside a $2.5 range for basically the whole day until power hour is incredibly odd… 

Now looking at the VIX daily here (and this is why I love TAing the VIX even though I get a tough of flak for it… but we broke through the critical 14.79 supply area yesterday which unlocked the bear movement for today… now we are back in the incredibly strop 17.2 to 17.91 VIX supply/ resistance area… IF the VIX can push through 17.91 then likely this sell off is just getting started and we could be looking at a sustained downside move to come… However, if this 17.91 supply holds once again (like it did in the middle of August) then likely we have found our temporary bottom and will look for further upside from here… 

Truly all eyes will be on the VIX… close over 17.91 and we start looking for 19.56 which unlocks the ultimate bear pain in the markets. Reject and especially close back under 17.2 supply and we likely found our bottom.

Coming into today I was obviously bearish and I honestly (while it did finally come during PH) I am a bit surprised that we didn’t see a true bear trend day… I was very caught off guard by essentially today from opening until 3pm today being a range day. 

My first short actually hit 7.25 points of profit which is extremely unfortunate because at 7.5 points of profit I lock in a 5 point stop loss… unfortunately that play on a massive reversal candle stopped me out at BE. 

2nd play I was extremely confident in and entered a little early before confirmation (which did come) however then we were chopping and after all of the morning range/ chop I decided to close out at what was support/ demand at that time as with the VIX movement and the fact that big tech like Apple and MSFT were pushing green I was worried about a reversal. 

I hit another great short (basically right after the 2nd short) and at the time sold the bottom. 

From there I waited all day until just before power hour to get into a short again. We were holding at the time 4396 support so well and I had quite seen the confirmation I wanted for further downside that I sold and then of course the bottom absolutely fell out… After that I was pretty much cash gang and just didn’t want to chase or fomo into anything. 

With yesterday being FOMC and an odd/ hard day to trade today was really the first Live forward testing of the updated strategy of sticking with the trend… now it did hit a 100% win rate today which is unlikely to continue and I did come in just under my daily profit goal also. I definitely could have netted far more points today but truly that opening hour volatility/ misdirection and the intraday range till power hour had me thrown off guard and I had no trust in plays anymore. But today netted a great result and I am very happy with how it turned out. 

This was a huge step forward in this strategy/ forward testing as usually and historically range days is the death of this strategy and today we came out on top. ",2023-09-21,28,1

The daily here is beyond extreme bear… WE not only broke through the daily 100ema but we closed a full candle below the daily 100ema support for the first time since March 2015. 

Now I will say we are 100% oversold on the daily DMI so there is definitely a need for a bounce here but we are also approaching extreme bear momentum here on the daily now. 

We are well below our 436.2 and 436.79 double demand and we actually came down to at the very last second to touch the 431.37 demand. 

From a weekly stand point here if we close under 437.62 I am bearish for next week… if we close under 433.04 then I am extremely bearish for next week and I would be looking for the low 420s to be retested. Realistically bulls need to get this back over the 437.62 minimum. 

If this plays out like June and repeats that pattern we likely will close in the 420s for the first time since the beginning of June. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 429.13 -> 428.06 -> 422.04  
 Demand- 431.37 -> 429.86 -> 426.57

From a daily stand point here on futures the fact that we are going to close under the 4374/4383 triple demand area is incredibly bearish. Honestly I am very surprised we were able to get that low and not only that but close under it. With a daily closure under the 100ema now and that triple demand area our sights are set on 4292 to 4312.

Now again the daily DMI is 100% oversold and that does warrant a potential bounce… but I would expect that bounce to be very short lived. 

The next major target is the daily 200ema which is 4285.

From a weekly stand point anything under 4381 is very bearish and bulls minimally need to close over 4395.

FUTURES DAILY   
 Supply- 4312 -> 4298 -> 4292 -> 4240  
 Demand- 4273 -> 4374 -> 4377 -> 4383

Taking a look at QQQ here we did manage to break through and close under the daily 100ema support also. We also broke through our double demand/ support area at 358.53/ 362.01. With that being broken through we should start to target 347.93 to 349.06 double demand area. 

Much like SPY the Qs is 100% oversold on daily DMI but it also is approaching extreme bear momentum. 

From a weekly stand point the Qs need to minimally close under 359.48 to be bearish and the bulls minimally need it over 359.48.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 337.6  
 Demand- 349.06 -> 347.93 -> 336.37

**VIX**

&#x200B;

The VIX had one heck of a day today… WE managed to finally take out our 15.96 demand. 

I am not sure if you guys caught the opening 30-45 minutes of oddity… on the VIX we were holding near 15.8 area and then on a one minute candle we saw the VIX flush to 15.1 LOD and then in the next 15 minute candle had push and recovered almost a full 10%... it was incredibly odd… 

Again I am not one to call manipulation as I just think 99.99% of the time traders use that as an excuse to why they were wrong instead of just admitting their trade failed… but the fact that we had a 10 point ($1) long 15min DOJI rejection candle on SPY and at the same time the VIX was doing all of its oddity… tells me that something bigger happened behind the scenes. 

That flash down on the VIX was enough to stop the momentum which then led to a full day of consolidation. 

For the time of momentum we carried and just overall selling we saw today (And volume 137% of 30day average) the fact that SPY held inside a $2.5 range for basically the whole day until power hour is incredibly odd… 

Now looking at the VIX daily here (and this is why I love TAing the VIX even though I get a tough of flak for it… but we broke through the critical 14.79 supply area yesterday which unlocked the bear movement for today… now we are back in the incredibly strop 17.2 to 17.91 VIX supply/ resistance area… IF the VIX can push through 17.91 then likely this sell off is just getting started and we could be looking at a sustained downside move to come… However, if this 17.91 supply holds once again (like it did in the middle of August) then likely we have found our temporary bottom and will look for further upside from here… 

Truly all eyes will be on the VIX… close over 17.91 and we start looking for 19.56 which unlocks the ultimate bear pain in the markets. Reject and especially close back under 17.2 supply and we likely found our bottom.

Coming into today I was obviously bearish and I honestly (while it did finally come during PH) I am a bit surprised that we didn’t see a true bear trend day… I was very caught off guard by essentially today from opening until 3pm today being a range day. 

My first short actually hit 7.25 points of profit which is extremely unfortunate because at 7.5 points of profit I lock in a 5 point stop loss… unfortunately that play on a massive reversal candle stopped me out at BE. 

2nd play I was extremely confident in and entered a little early before confirmation (which did come) however then we were chopping and after all of the morning range/ chop I decided to close out at what was support/ demand at that time as with the VIX movement and the fact that big tech like Apple and MSFT were pushing green I was worried about a reversal. 

I hit another great short (basically right after the 2nd short) and at the time sold the bottom. 

From there I waited all day until just before power hour to get into a short again. We were holding at the time 4396 support so well and I had quite seen the confirmation I wanted for further downside that I sold and then of course the bottom absolutely fell out… After that I was pretty much cash gang and just didn’t want to chase or fomo into anything. 

With yesterday being FOMC and an odd/ hard day to trade today was really the first Live forward testing of the updated strategy of sticking with the trend… now it did hit a 100% win rate today which is unlikely to continue and I did come in just under my daily profit goal also. I definitely could have netted far more points today but truly that opening hour volatility/ misdirection and the intraday range till power hour had me thrown off guard and I had no trust in plays anymore. But today netted a great result and I am very happy with how it turned out. 

This was a huge step forward in this strategy/ forward testing as usually and historically range days is the death of this strategy and today we came out on top. ",2023-09-21,29,1

* FOMC Meeting at 2pm, followed by Powell Presser at 2:30 (eastern)
   * Markets pricing nearly no chance of a rate hike and about 35% chance of a hike in November 
   * Interest rate projections, dot plots and more will be a feature of what is expected to be a fairly uneventful 
* UK CPI comes in cooler than expected, now less than 50% chance of rate hike tomorrow (was more than 50% pre-CPI)
* Fedex, KB Home report after the close.   


**Expected Moves into Friday:**

* SPY: 1%
* QQQ: 1.2%
* IWM: 1.2%

SPY 0DTE vol is about 19 into the FOMC meeting, then resets back to about 12 next week, showing that although today is expected to be fairly uneventful, there are some option buyers expecting at least some market reaction to Powell.

**Today's Earnings**

* **FedEx Corporation (FDX) E**xpected Move: **4.40%**
* **KB Home (KBH)** Expected Move: **5.27%**

FedEx reports after the close. Options are pricing in about a 4.4% move. Recent earnings have seen the stock move -3%, +4%, +3% and -3%. So the expected move today is on the high side of the past 4 but the stock has been remarkably consistent in moves on earnings over the past year.

The stock has been calm into the print, with realized vol (how much the stock has actually moved) over the past 30 days just 16. That compares to option vol this week of 82, and 30-day IV of 32. In general, the stock has been less volatile in real life than options have been pricing. For reference, the realized vol over the past year is about 27.

Given that info , does anyone know how legit the paper trading is? Meaning, am I going to get crappier execution prices if I go live?

Or with SPY, a 50k market order is a super small drop in a super big bucket and I can expect roughly the same execution prices / latency?

Side note bonus question:  I keep having to restart TWS manually nightly, their auto daily restart seems to be messed up the last couple of weeks (months?) I think since a tws update. Streaming prices , sometimes something goes bad and I need to restart my app and/or TWS. Anyone else have and fix a similar issue?

Double bonus: anyone go from TWS to IB API? I’ve been more on the algo side, my partner more on trade execution/ price steaming / IB integration stuff. TWS … it gets the job done. I think I’d prefer the api, any reasons why I shouldn’t switch?  I’ve seen posts that mention a paid for layer on top of IB API? Can someone remind me and recommend (or criticize)?",2023-09-14,8,20

The VIX closed at 13, down from 18 on August 18th while the SPY rallied 4% during that time. Weekly SPY vol really got crushed into the long weekend with at-the-money options in SPY for this next week in single digits. That should pick on the open as market makers reset for the new week. 0DTE options in SPY which had been pricing in 0.6-.07% daily moves were back below 0.5%. Keep an eye on those if IV ticks up from 7 to 10 just after the long weekend.

Despite the uptick in realized vol in the market from the very low levels of the spring grind higher, the SPY has basically remained in about a 6% range since June. The past week's rally put it near the top of that range.

The economic calendar perhaps has bigger news overseas this week than domestically, so those are included below. The earnings calendar is winding down over the next two weeks but this week sees reports from Zscaler and Docusign. Below are this week's expected moves, they are smaller both because its a 4 day week but also as vol got crushed into the long weekend. Those may tick higher on the open:

165st55_SPY,SPY,I rode a +$1.32 move in SPY and made $2. 'Splain it to me,"As title states, I was riding a banger move, but had no idea it was a banger because I was going red and green through the entire trade. In and out on the arrows.  


I took a cheap, OTM 0dte call with a 453 strike. I figured it was early enough in the day still (10:51AM) and I wouldn't get crushed by theta until after 1:30p or so. I entered the call at $11, and the highest this moved was to @$15 while I held. Exited at 12:21PM with a huge $2 gainer. 

I wanted to take this same exact call at open for $15 but missed the entry. It ran up to $46 before the pullback. How can this option move like that earlier, but not reflect SPY's gain pre-noon?

I don't usually pay much attention to the greeks b/c I almost never hold more than 15 minutes. I was up $4 pretty quickly after entering, but I thought it had more to go... aaaaaaand it did. A LOT more.

Anyhow, more of a rant than anything else, and a warning to others to NOT take the cheap +2 OTM option 0dte after 10-1030am.

For the record, I'm taking these cheap ass contracts bc I'm working on my confidence and entries. A small loss is better than using that awful paper trading that would've given me a fake $20 win right off the bat.

Salesforce reports tomorrow after the close. The expected move of 6% is at the lower end of the range of recent reports but more than the actual move on the last report (-5%, +12%, -8%). Options expiring Friday are about 78 IV, with 30-day out options about 39 IV. The stock has been quiet into the report with the past 30-day actual vol just 23 (compared to the past year's actual/realized vol of 36).

Here's a peek at an Iron Condor set at the expected move (based on yesterday's close), risking about  140 to make 110. More on that tomorrow, as well as CRWD, OKTA and more.

Salesforce reports tomorrow after the close. The expected move of 6% is at the lower end of the range of recent reports but more than the actual move on the last report (-5%, +12%, -8%). Options expiring Friday are about 78 IV, with 30-day out options about 39 IV. The stock has been quiet into the report with the past 30-day actual vol just 23 (compared to the past year's actual/realized vol of 36).

Here's a peek at an Iron Condor set at the expected move (based on yesterday's close), risking about  140 to make 110. More on that tomorrow, as well as CRWD, OKTA and more.

Wife call and needed help with kiddos and of course that’s when it spikes to at/over my cost basis (1pm EST ish). Wasn’t at comp for about 35 min, so couldn’t close.

0DTE expected moves are about 0.6% in SPY, up from 0.4% each day a few weeks ago. The VIX got within sniffing distance of 19 last week, a level it hasn't seen since the Spring. The options market is pretty much pricing an end to the super-low volatility in stocks we saw for most of the Summer, but it's not yet signaling a ton of panic, as the selling the past two weeks has been mostly orderly.

15ukr3w_PANW,PANW,"Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto","Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.

Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.

A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:

Futures are lower this morning following bank downgrades. On the economic front, we saw some FOMC speeches. Philly Fed President Harker suggested the Fed is done with rate hikes. 1,2, and 10 yr US treasury yields are all lower this morning. The VIX is back towards 17 this morning, continuing a recent wake-up in option vol from the mid-summer doldrums. 17 is still below the historical mean but option prices aren't as dirt cheap as they were just a few weeks ago. 0DTE SPY IV for today closed at just 7 yesterday, pricing in less than an 0.5% move, futures are already lower by more than that pre-market so expected an increase in that IV on the open. SPY vol for Thursday and Friday closed yesterday at 11, still low but showing an upward curve. 30-day IV in SPY (at the money) was closer to 14.

15kon2b_SPY,SPY,Buy Long Dated SPY calls and join the military is a guaranteed winning strategy.,"Within the next 4-5 years, there are 3 possible scenarios.

WW3 didn't happen. You serve for 4 yrs. Got about 100K saved, since you don't have much need for spending in the army, and you can't YOLO FDs with your life saving. I say 100K is reasonable. Better yet, your long calls are deep ITM and US is prospering. So you can straight up retire after your service.

WW3 did happen, and US won. Same as above, and you can retire even more comfortably.

WW3 did happen, and US lost (or lost global dominance in any capacity). Well, just die on the battlefield, and you still don't have to worry about money again. And you will be remembered as a brave soldier instead of some guy sucking dicks behind Wendy's.

I see this as a Win-Win-Win situation.

Oh, did I mention you will also be fit asf without paying for gym membership?",2023-08-07,2727,442

15jugdy_BP,BP,SPY Analysis,"SPY has been on a massive uptrend pretty much since May. Last week, there was a huge engulfing candle , engulfing 2 weeks of bullish moves. This is a very strong bearish sign. Taking swings to the downside looks really good but there will need to be a push down below 432ish for a complete reversal. Swinging puts about 1-2 months out look pretty good right now, but there hasn't been too much confirmation yet. 

&#x200B;

On the bearish side of things, I'll be looking for a retest of 452 looks pretty good. There still seems to be some aggressive buyers still with BP, but there is not many passive buyers. I wouldn't be surprised if we overshoot 452 buy 1-2 dollars but if it overshoots more that that, I'd be really surprised. 

&#x200B;

For a bullish scenario, a retest of 444-443 looks very good. I will have to watch price action down there, but I'm not 100% sure if there will be buyers there, given the relatively low volume, massive bearish candles. A push to 437 looks pretty good as well, given last week's huge engulfing, but same with the 444-443 level, price action isn't showing anything at all yet.

&#x200B;

Next week will seem like a really interesting week, it could easily be the difference between a continuation, with potential to push up to all time highs or we could see a reversal. QQQ still has room to push as well and has a similar setup as SPY, take that if it looks better for you. 🙂

15j5xe5_SPY,SPY,"Mark Minervini: ""There may be more downside to come for $SPY.""","Mark Minervini, stock trader and author, tweeted the following on Friday: 

""Market reversed off the highs and SPY is putting in a bearish engulfing ""outside day."" During a correction, it's normal for the market to start off strong and end the day weak. That's one of the signs that the correction has not yet run its course and there may be more downside to come. 

The real troubling action I'm seeing here is the extreme pick up in volatility in individual names (many in response to earnings). In a good number of cases we are seeing pivot failures and even full blown base failures. 

The market is under pressure. We are cautious in the near-term, but would look to buy a market pullback of 5-10% on SPY. Our long-term SPY buy signal issued on January 13, 2023 remains in effect.""

15fvgoa_SPY,SPY,"If my time horizon on my IRA is 30 years, why wouldn’t I used a 3x Index fund instead of $SPY?","Hi, basically the title. I am in my twenties, and am soon opening a Roth IRA to supplement my 401k. As the title says, I am not going to be taking from this until retirement, which is decades out.

I understand that obviously 3x levered accounts are MUCH more volatile and pose more risk. However, if my time horizon is 20+ years, isn’t it sensible to use a 3x levered index fund? My rational being that over the course of 30 years, any volatility would just be noise and the market would ALMOST (obviously nothing guaranteed) certainly be higher then than now. 

Basically I would invest in a 3x levered account with the idea of holding until 10 years before retirement. At that point I would de-risk like most middle aged folks. Replace the 3x with SPY and increase my weighting towards fixed incomes etc.",2023-08-02,51,173

* Futures are red, pulling back from yesterday's (and month's end) strong close.

15agz67_META,META,"FOMC Day and META Earnings… 7-26-23 SPY/ ES FUTURES, QQQ and VIX DAILY MARKET ANALYSIS","This is officially without a doubt one of the most boring FOMC days I have ever seen… the initial FOMC rate hike reaction had one of if not the smallest reaction in almost 1.5 years… 

**FOMC**

So lets talk about FOMC… what was said and what can we expect in the future…

(I am going to just copy and past some tweets here for you to read and then I will discuss)

· The Fed raised its funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. The midpoint of this range would be the highest level for the benchmark rate since early 2001.

· Fed Powell: The full effects of tightening are yet to be felt.

· Fed's Powell: We haven't made any decisions about future meetings.

· Powell: Inflation has proven more resilient than expected.

· Powell has said that the staff are no longer forecasting a recession.

· Federal Reserve's Powell has said: I don't see inflation back at 2% until about 2025.

· FOMC: Voted 11-0 For Fed Funds Rate Action 

· FOMC: Economic Activity Has Been Expanding At a Moderate Pace 

· FOMC: Job Gains Have Been Robust in Recent Months, Unemployment Rate Has Remained Low 

· FOMC Will Continue to Assess Additional Information, Implications for Monetary Policy 

· FOMC: Future Actions Depend on Tightening Impact, Economic and Financial Developments

· FED SWAPS CONTINUE PRICING IN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF ADDITIONAL HIKE

· Analyst: Fed May Consider Another Rate Hike In September, But Will Assess The Impact Of Previous Moves And Inflation Trends Before Making A Decision

· POWELL: FOMC TO TAKE DATA-DEPENDENT APPROACH ON FUTURE HIKES, WILL MAKE DECISIONS MEETING BY MEETING

· POWELL: WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY DECISIONS ABOUT ANY FUTURE MEETINGS

· Analyst: The Lack Of Changes In The Policy Statement Was A Surprise, And While There Was A Slight Increase In The Hawkish Tone Regarding Economic Growth, The Overall Message Is That The Fed Is Neither Dismissing Nor Confirming The Possibility Of Another Rate Hike.

Overall the message here is about what I expected… I expected JPOw to neither confirm nor deny a further rate hike in September but rather to say that it was data depenedent like usual… honestly much of his speech was about the same as the last 6 meetings… same story different day… a few notable mentions though is that JPOW did say they do not forecast a recession and that they admitted inflation is more resilient than expected. 

It will be interesting to see how markets digest this over night as this was one of the more mild if not the mildest reaction to a FOMC day that I have ever seen. 

**META EARNINGS**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1na8uc90edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9996a49cdceeb3002c7db0c360fbb76e19513d16

As of right now META has a major green reaction… it has as of this writing given back a lot of the green… 

Digging deeper into the earnings looks like a nice revenue and EPS beat… also a bit of a surprising upside beat on active users… as of right now though there is not really enough of a move up though at 5% (as of writing) to beat the implied move… likely calls and puts will lose on this one… it will also be curious to see how markets react on the call… that is where both MSFT and TSLA met their demise. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zipky3p0edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc21ec8afb4badfa6fb2f193aa996436d680080

Overall on Spy this actually was a terribly boring range bound day… prior to actual FOMC minutes we didn’t even break $1.2 for most of the day… in the end though SPY finally broke through this massive wall at $455 that we have been fighting at… however, we were not able to breach and hold over 456.82 supply…. That currently remains our next upside resistance. 

We were extremely close until pretty much the last second of putting a new supply in today… but with that last minute push up we were able to avoid that… We continue to hold the daily ema support also…. With a daily dmi wave up the favor remains to the upside but we are clearly stuck in this range…. I wouldn’t be too aggressive going long until spy closes over 456.82 and I wouldn’t be too eager to short until we close under 452.1. Anything in between is straight consolidation and chop. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 447.02 -> 454.21 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 452.1 -> 466.05

**FUTURES DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/niuyhi61edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4abd4d1b9774c674e464fede21e55085b4541a6

A real tough move on Futures here with the double top but bounce off of the daily 8ema support. We did just barely avoid a daily supply being put in… as of now momentum continues to be to the upside. Our next major resistance will be 4621. Bulls also will need to defend 4595 supply as support or we likely will see a retest of 4563 demand. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply -4596 -> 4621 -> 4667  
 Demand- 4563 -> 4653

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3bicx1m1edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=896021bd8984d1bd6af8c29df803f642e9a39172

This was a bit of a struggle day for QQQ today… we also barely and narrowly EOD survived not putting a new supply in… however we were able to backtest the 376.16 demand and also daily 20ema support and hold those levels…

We continue to see a daily DMI waving up, however, bulls need to retake the daily 8ema resistance tomorrow and also need to close over 379.16 to break this consolidation on QQQ… Likely with the meta beat we could see a nice post-fomc bounce tomorrow on TECH. 

There is quite a bit of support being established here at this 376 level which should lead to further upside from here… 385.73 remains my first upside target with 388.47 and 389.92 as the next major upside target. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 370.39 -> 371.41 -> 385.73 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 376.16 -> 400.01

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7h8hn952edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f080052b1f5917fe43f592049fc382a50778cac

Unsurprisingly the VIX did see a downside move today and did close back under the daily 8ema and also established a new daily supply… we only slightly moved the current 14 supply to 14.02… this 14 level on the VIX has become a solid resistance and rejection area… 

We also interestingly enough closed below the 13.29 and 13.59 demand. Next major support is 12.89 on the VIX… 

The VIX continues to point to further upside or minimally consolidation on the markets.

As a momentum/ breakout trader I have got to say this… these last 3 days of trading have pretty much been my worst case scenario… absolutely no continuation, no breakouts and just overall terrible technicals for entries. Not only that when we finally do get a solid A+ set up we are left with such tiny range and movements that we don’t even receive a proper payout. 

I am hoping regardless of what way the markets choose to go that they chose to go that way in a decently big way… ",2023-07-26,12,1

**MSFT**

https://preview.redd.it/i1gzgmkua6eb1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=455e86264e0a9bcc6e45871e7fb2a9080f03bb67

As of right now MSFT is sitting red on its earnings… overall not a terrible earnings from MSFT despite the redness…. A beat on Revenue and on EPS… kind of surprising seeing MSFT down here but this is what Tesla did also… 

**GOOG**

&#x200B;

Google with a massive and impressive beat here… Overall google calls are going to absolutely print. With a big beat here on Google it will be interesting to see if this is the boost that tech needed. 

**FOMC**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z5ph3kcva6eb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9265b25cce1aea1be17495b242f83972ff3f2cb0

As of right now it is a 98.9% odds that we get a 25bps rate hike tomorrow… so it is safe to say that we with certainty will get a 25bps hike tomorrow as the market is expecting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pjlvetqva6eb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef46e9f47ecd5f563d813202d1754f0efe81b30f

Now what really matters is what JPOW has to say for next FOMC meeting in September. Now keep in mind these few things… we KNOW as of right now according to Cleveland fed nowcast that inflation next month will increase… now the question and what we don’t know as of right now is that a one off rebound or is this the bottom for a long time? 

My thoughts are that JPOW gives the same old same old speech about being data dependent and that we are likely to have a “live” September meeting. If JPOW leaves it that way and also reassures us that banks are strong and what not (basically the same old same old) I believe we see a rally post FOMC. However, if JPOW even hints at having thought about a 50bps or comes in hawkish on next meeting with inflation then we could see a pretty bearish reaction to this data. 

I think markets will continue to front run tomorrows fomc as the last hike for a long time. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f1zubn5wa6eb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=426de925b444ee0096a33ae9574a2a26283b4127

After we put a new demand in yesterday we finally are seeing our breakout from the 452.1 to 454.21 consolidation. That would favor that this is the start of a run up. Now of course we have FOMC tomorrow and that could be a bit of a game changer depending on what JPOW has to say… but as of now I am expecting a breakout. 

It is notable that SPY did fail to break through 456.82 supply. That is our next major resistance to break through and close over… if we do then our next target is 461.48 and then 466.05. I am bullish on SPY currently with 460+ being my ultimate target. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 447.02 -> 454.21 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 452.1 -> 466.05

**FUTURES DAILY**

Much like SPY we have a new daily demand yesterday on futures and we did finally break out of this 4595 to 4563 consolidation. With this breakout, bounce off daily 8ema support, extreme bull momentum on weekly and daily with a daily DMI move up… I am bullish and I do expect us to continue to push to the 4600+ area into next week. 

Next key resistance and level to watch is 4621. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4595 ->4621 -> 4667  
 Demand- 4563 -> 4653

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

Tech attempted to show some bullish strength today but actually end up showing slight weakness EOD. Now with a big google beat and depending on what MSFT does after hours we could finally see a huge move up on the Qs tomorrow and into the EOW. 

We did finally also get our new daily demand put in at 376.29 on Q today… This then gives us an upside target of 385.73… but my ultimate target for the EOW is 388.47 to 389.92. 

After we break out and close over 389.92 my ultimate target is 400-401.83. 

We also have a daily DMI Wave up starting on QQQ which supports further upside. 

As long as bulls continue to defend 376.29 I only see consolidation and/ or upside. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 385.73 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 376.29 -> 400.01

**VIX**

The VIX once again attempted to push up here. However, today we actually saw the VIX despite holding green almost all day close red. We did once again fail to close over the daily 20ema and over the supply level at 14. 

The VIX likely will see a sell off tomorrow post fomc which should give us a new supply off todays candle high at 14.03… that would also break this red bull channel on the VIX and should also give spy/ qqq further upside.

Today was another boring day of trading for me. I got stopped out on a call as you see this morning and then I took another call around noon that end up being stopped out at breakeven. After that I honestly never saw anything that looked suitable for entry. 

Today we ended up moving up purely on momentum. However, this was not quite the strong momentum we are used to on trend days… if you step back and look at it on SPY and QQQ really until just before power hour we held a bull trend day… 

Now the issue is that ever retest of support on the 15min 5ema really looked like the next leg down… however, that became the buy the dip opportunity and led to further upside… if you trade based strictly on the fact the 15min 5ema was going to hold support and not fail no matter what then you likely did well today… but for me I never saw an A+ setup and the few plays that were B setups that I watched barely netted 5% profits on 1dte due to the fact that we held a pretty tight range most of the day. 

I am looking forward to FOMC tomorrow hopefully giving the markets a reason to pick a direction and push that way. ",2023-07-25,9,0

As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print. The expected move for SPY today is about 0.5% with the QQQ about 0.8%.

Apple's expected move over the next month is about 5%, that time period includes and earnings report.

14s8h0q_DAL,DAL,"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more","Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

**Chart of the Day:**

NFLX options are currently pricing about an 8% move between now and the days after its earnings, a move smaller than 6 out of its last 8 actual earnings moves.

14s8h0q_SQ,SQ,"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more","Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times.

**Chart of the Day:**

NFLX options are currently pricing about an 8% move between now and the days after its earnings, a move smaller than 6 out of its last 8 actual earnings moves.

14s8h0q_PFE,PFE,"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more","Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

14raa25_MRNA,MRNA,"Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.","Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday. 

The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up 18% in July (one trading day). Options are pricing just a 10% move for the rest of the month, a potential disconnect between realized and implied.

14raa25_PFE,PFE,"Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.","Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday. 

The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up 18% in July (one trading day). Options are pricing just a 10% move for the rest of the month, a potential disconnect between realized and implied.

14raa25_DAL,DAL,"Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.","Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday. 

The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.

14pix8k_LCID,LCID,"Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.","Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.

On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

**Chart of the Day:**

SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.

14pix8k_NKE,NKE,"Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.","Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

14mysv9_UAL,UAL,"Expected moves, Core PCE, SPY, QQQ","Futures are higher this morning. The market still has to digest the Fed's preferred inflation measure of core PCE which drops before the open. It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.

14mysv9_MS,MS,"Expected moves, Core PCE, SPY, QQQ","Futures are higher this morning. The market still has to digest the Fed's preferred inflation measure of core PCE which drops before the open. It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.

SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years.

14m299g_DE,DE,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

14m299g_SNOW,SNOW,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

14m299g_SBUX,SBUX,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

14l8kq8_IBM,IBM,"Expected moves today: SPY, QQQ, Micron and more.","As market participants await words from Jay Powell, stock futures have slipped slightly into the red with tech pulling back from its recent rally. Chip stocks like Nvidia are leading the way lower following a report in the WSJ that the U.S. is considering restricting AI-focused chips from being exported to China. Powell's remarks will be interesting considering the economic data of late like consumer confidence and housing starts showing the economy still plugging away. He is speaking at an ECB / Central banker gathering with Christine Lagarde also appearing. The 1-year treasury is around 5.30, higher than before the SVB mess, and the 2-year yield is 4.74, still below its pre-SVB peak but has been moving towards those levels.

The VIX remains below 14 with SPY at the money vol about 11.

On the earnings front Micron (MU) is set to update today, with Nike reporting tomorrow.

Chip stocks like Nvidia are leading the way lower following a report in the WSJ that the U.S. is considering restricting AI-focused chips from being exported to China. Powell's remarks will be interesting considering the economic data of late like consumer confidence and housing starts showing the economy still plugging away. He is speaking at an ECB / Central banker gathering with Christine Lagarde also appearing. The 1-year treasury is around 5.30, higher than before the SVB mess, and the 2-year yield is 4.74, still below its pre-SVB peak but has been moving towards those levels.

The VIX remains below 14 with SPY at the money vol about 11.

On the earnings front Micron (MU) is set to update today, with Nike reporting tomorrow.

I will be back trading full time Monday (don’t forget that’s a half day and markets closed tueday). 

Well this was officially the strongest bull and trend day we have had since June 1st… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7x1frk9com8b1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1351bb3e527b16b8daf37b8768bd7966200e3e

Remember JPOW is scheduled to speak tomorrow at 930am. From what I am seeing it is a panel like meeting and there should be questions… not really sure much other than that. It will be interesting to see how markets react this time as last week they did not take anything he had to say too hot… nor was pre market. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h48bklpcom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=be530f12d327204ee51a9d3b1129cbadad263e5e

Well it officially happened! We officially got a new daily demand at 431.37 and we also started our daily DMI wave up. 

Now we did not quite touch 430 nor touch the daily 20ema like I was hoping for… but this looks like a very convincible v bottom before we start our next leg up… 

As you can see we came close to 436.95 but did not quite hit it today to take that level out… 

Our upside target will be 442.55 and 445.34 this week IF bulls can punch through 436.95 and defend the daily 8ema tomorrow. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ruc3c25dom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fbe5e19507ef71653b7c203eed6746e04b7df50

We now have a clear uptrend here and have clearly broken the red bear channel that started back on June 16th. As of now unless tomorrow we immediately drop and close back under the daily 8ema my expectation is a continuation upward. 

I actually was extremely tempted to open some Friday DTE calls for my vaca with a target of 445 (or even next Friday DTE) but with JPOW tomorrow morning I decided that wasn’t a smart idea. No reason to risk markets negatively reacting to JPOW. 

This backtest of support here really could be the pullback that bulls needed to push us to that magical 450 number… 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 442.55 -> 445.34  
 Demand- 436.95 -> 431.37  
 Support- 432.3 -> 431.4 -> 429.7  
 Resistance- 436.3 -> 439.4 -> 442.8

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfrkwildom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a59488a917ace18e557a0ae3849bf31f362c0157

Futures also finally got a new daily demand… this one came just about 100 pts higher than the previous… seems about every 80-100 pts we do establish a new daily demand. 

With this nice double bottom, daily demand, DMI wave up and recovery over the daily 8ema our expectation should be continuation to the upside… our major target will be 4467 to 4472. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/slfr5k1eom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d51f62c8547ace757a301791e4491ee4384b726

Futures also broke the daily red bear channel and now finds itself in an uptrend… while we again did not touch the daily 20ema like I would have liked and I really would have liked to see that contract roll gap down to 4300 filled… this is a pretty bullish potential start of a v bottom. 

Bulls need to now punch through 4427 which as you can see is a pretty strong resistance and is also just about where futures stopped its run today. IF bulls close over and push through 4427 then I do like our upside target to be 4467-4472 by the EOW. 

However, if we negatively react to JPOW tomorrow and drop back under the daily 8ema to close… then likely we will see that 4341 to 4351 support area retested. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4472 -> 4467 -> 4312  
 Demand- 4375 -> 4537  
 Support- 4375 -> 4351  
 Resistance- 4415 -> 4427 -> 4469

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2btnbiheom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6b30c5196f550b7e2062ab887848c6634c49de9

Now here on QQQ we also started a new daily demand today at 357.6. We did not end up coming down low enough to actually touch the daily 20ema now did we come low enough to take out the 357.09 supply. However with this new higher demand and recovery over the daily 8ema we should start to put 370.39 and 371.41 back into our playbook. 

The one difference here on QQQ vs. SPY/ES is that we did not start a daily DMI wave up. That could suggest that this is once again a dead cat bounce. 

With the breakout of the red bear channel though that does suggest an upside push and does also establish a new possible yellow bull channel as you can see. 

My upside still remains 370-371 and then if we can really break out 377-380.

However, if this much like last Thursday is just a big dead cat bounce and a bull trap… then we will once again set our sights on 357.09 and 354.95. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 371.41 -> 370.39 -> 357.09 -> 354.95  
 Demand- 357.6 -> 380.1

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dcnwhhxeom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b7b893fb1297e364f869e0bc63d60161e92ade

The VIX much like QQQ does have me a little hesitant on going straight bull… mostly because we have not seen a new daily supply put in on the VIX… as you can see we did touch, reject and close below the 14.51 supply and closed back under the daily 20/8ema today… however, until we really get the daily supply as further confirmation of downside on the VIX with the daily demand on SPY/ QQQ it is still slightly speculative. 

If we see a red day tomorrow on the VIX we likely will get a new supply at 14.13 which then sets our targets once again on the 12.89 area for the VIX and possibly even lower before we bounce and find a new demand. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

No trades today for me…

I tossed around what I wanted to do a lot last night… I had considered trading QQQ today but I ultimately decided against that because I hadn’t had time to fully backtest my strategy on QQQ. 

What I ended up doing today is I basically took a research day… instead of actually entering trades I really just analyzed SPY all day and its technicals and then took some “phantom” trades… so basically watching premiums to see if I had entered at $XYZ would it have been profitable or not…

Scalp wise in the end I would have still had a down day (granted small and I had much better success than the last few weeks). I am fully on board with putting my scalp strategy on the back burner for a while… my goal is to still watch for “perfect” scalp entries and when I see that the plays I am watching become more profitable and successful than not (like now) I will bring it back into the rotation. 

I went back to my OG level to level trade strategy that I used a lot end of 2022 and beginning of 2023. I was going to just start right back up real trading this but it had been a long time since I was able to do this and I wanted to see how premiums moved… I started out on 5dte and eventually moved down to 3dte… 3dte does seem like a really nice sweet spot for these… 

The biggest things I learned here today which will make this strategy that much more better next week when im back trading full time is that 1. Do not fight momentum (scalping is different as you can quick hit a scalp with a reversion to mean against momentum)… 2. The 15min trend with the assistance of the 5min trend is what I need to listen to… wait for confirmation and do not let the 5min trend head fake you (I had a morning put that the 15min said to hold and was golden but the 5min bull trapped me… sold a “-5% loss” only for it to then go on to be 15% “profits.”) and 3. Trust my targets… this is a big different here between scalps and l2l… scalps yeah I have an upside or downside target but mostly sell early because of theta and premiums being crushed… with these l2l I have to really trust my upside targets… set a breakeven stop once I see some profits and just continue to move that stop up until I hit the next target. 

Overall I am mentally ready for a nice VACA with family and some time away from the markets… but I look forward to next week already. 

Enjoy the rest of the week trading… remember capital preservation and risk management is the key to success! ",2023-06-27,4,0

14jed4y_NKE,NKE,"Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.","SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.

14jed4y_MRNA,MRNA,"Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.","SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.

**Chart of the Day**

Some SPY options have seen IV marks below 10 recently.

14jed4y_OXY,OXY,"Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.","SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.

Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up around 70% in the past 2 months yet options are only pricing about a 20% move for the rest of the Summer. Options rarely get this name right when it makes big rips higher.

I do this post every morning as sort of a daily trading arsenal and figured I'd share it here rather than just a weekly post. Do you all enjoy it? Is there something else you'd like me to include? Let me know in the comments. Even the haters and losers :-)

14g3dsd_RIVN,RIVN,"Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.","Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up around 70% in the past 2 months yet options are only pricing about a 20% move for the rest of the Summer. Options rarely get this name right when it makes big rips higher.

I do this post every morning as sort of a daily trading arsenal and figured I'd share it here rather than just a weekly post. Do you all enjoy it? Is there something else you'd like me to include? Let me know in the comments. Even the haters and losers :-)

14g3dsd_FSLR,FSLR,"Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.","Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

Tesla stock is up around 70% in the past 2 months yet options are only pricing about a 20% move for the rest of the Summer. Options rarely get this name right when it makes big rips higher.

I do this post every morning as sort of a daily trading arsenal and figured I'd share it here rather than just a weekly post. Do you all enjoy it? Is there something else you'd like me to include? Let me know in the comments. Even the haters and losers :-)

14f7h7b_RIVN,RIVN,"Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX","Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks. 

As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how ""cheap"" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.

SPY vol is just 15 in November

14f7h7b_TGT,TGT,"Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX","Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks. 

As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how ""cheap"" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.

14eaj6s_FDX,FDX,"Expected moves this week: SPY, FedEx, Carmax and more","Stock futures are slightly lower this morning, following Friday's slight pullback. Despite Friday's selling SPY finished up 2.2% last week, continuing a strong June that has already seen SPY higher by more than 5%. It's been a pretty textbook Summer grind higher thus far, with very low IV and tight intra-week ranges. As mentioned before, a slow grind higher usually results in low IV, but at the same time, low IV helps set up the conditions for a slow grind, as long gamma in the market prevents the market from rocketing to the upside, and on sell-offs there are usually buyers waiting below. For the market to break from that trend usually takes some sort of fear or FOMO that turns options sellers into buyers, freeing the market up from long gamma and allowing larger moves. Options aren't anticipating that those conditions change anytime soon, with SPY IV just 11 for this week. The expected move for SPY for the week is around 1%.

The biggest thing happening on the economic front this week is Fed Chairman Powell's congressional testimony on Wednesday (during market hours). On the earnings front, we hear from FedEx today, and Carmax on Friday. Options are pricing about a 5% move in FedEx today.

14eaj6s_ORCL,ORCL,"Expected moves this week: SPY, FedEx, Carmax and more","Stock futures are slightly lower this morning, following Friday's slight pullback. Despite Friday's selling SPY finished up 2.2% last week, continuing a strong June that has already seen SPY higher by more than 5%. It's been a pretty textbook Summer grind higher thus far, with very low IV and tight intra-week ranges. As mentioned before, a slow grind higher usually results in low IV, but at the same time, low IV helps set up the conditions for a slow grind, as long gamma in the market prevents the market from rocketing to the upside, and on sell-offs there are usually buyers waiting below. For the market to break from that trend usually takes some sort of fear or FOMO that turns options sellers into buyers, freeing the market up from long gamma and allowing larger moves. Options aren't anticipating that those conditions change anytime soon, with SPY IV just 11 for this week. The expected move for SPY for the week is around 1%.

The biggest thing happening on the economic front this week is Fed Chairman Powell's congressional testimony on Wednesday (during market hours). On the earnings front, we hear from FedEx today, and Carmax on Friday. Options are pricing about a 5% move in FedEx today.

143c8n4_SPY,SPY,Can the SPY create a swing high this week in the midst of Apple chaos? + What would this mean for penny stocks," The SPY is up about 20% since October, and it doesn’t look like it wants to slow down. It is at a crucial level right now where it can break or get rejected hard at the $430 resistance. If it pushes past the resistance and turns it into support, market sentiment will significantly shift to fewer bears. If you are unfamiliar with what a swing high is and why this pattern is a strong bullish indicator, here are some reasons why:

**Higher Highs:** Swing highs signify that the current price has surpassed the previous swing high, forming a higher high in the price chart. Higher highs often indicate a bullish trend and suggest the potential for further upward movement.

**Resistance Breakout:** Swing highs represent a breakout above a significant resistance level. When the price surpasses a previous resistance level, buyers have gained enough strength to overcome selling pressure, which is a positive sign for future price appreciation.

**Trend Continuation:** Swing highs can confirm that the existing uptrend is likely to continue. If swing highs consistently form at higher levels, the underlying trend remains intact, providing confidence to traders and investors to stay engaged in the market.

Building upon this bullish analysis, I have identified two stocks that align with the current market sentiment. Both AGBA (AGBA Group Holding Limited) and DFLI (Dragonfly Energy) could potentially experience favorable price movements if the current bullish sentiment continues and the broader market, represented by the SPY, successfully breaks above the $430 resistance level, converting it into a support level.

**$AGBA** \- Major Player in Hong Kong's financial realm

Target: $1.70

$**DFLI** \- With its new technologies and strong energy presence it looks to capitalize on the bullish momentum from the markets.

Target: $3

13yor38_JPM,JPM,"The VIX just had its lowest close since Pre-Covid … 6-2-23 SPY/ ES futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis","I said this a few weeks ago and it remains true today… “It is far too early to short this market, but at this point it feels far too late to go long on this market too…” What does that mean? IT means while yes I do think at this rate the VIX could see 12-13 and SPY could see 430-440… at this point counting on this rally to continue feels like pure FOMO, however, counting on this rally to come to a dramatic end feels like straight YOLO… 

Another thing here is that while I do think the upside is the ease of momentum right now… the odds we wake up to a bank collapsing or some other black swan event seemingly is increasing as time goes on… this honestly is the worst place the markets could be right now…

The question I hate to be asking myself once again is “What is going to stop this rally?” I feel like for months now we get to these “ideal scenarios” that will finally put the market in its place and take it down etc. etc. and then the market just barely makes it by everytime… The way this thing is shaping up is that this truly is going to be a “this time is different” market recovery from bear market to bull market… OR we are just setting ourselves up for one of the biggest and most unexpected crashes this market has seen… 

**To Pause or Not to Pause**

What is the one thing the fed wants but wont directly say they want? That would be higher unemployment rate… this mornings 3.7% UE is the highest reading since December 2022. However, since March 2022 (over a year now) we have NOT gotten a single UE reading over 3.7%.... it seems that the UE hits that level (4 times now over the last 1+ year) and then immediately retraces…

With the highest UE you would have expected the odds of a pause in June to nearly hit 80-90%... however, we are actually seeing a slight pullback here on the odds and now are looking only at a 70.1% chance of a pause in June… 

However, of course market is rallying like a pause and rate cuts have already happened. 

**Is TECH Topping out?** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d4c5ka7k3o3b1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=28fbb5b7050458bfb8a9814bba6136e6e250ab64

In the screenshot above you will see the breadth of S&P500, NASDAQ and NYSE… what does this show? Well in simple terms this shows the buying/ selling pressure of the market… 0 is neutral… what is very interesting to me here is that this is now the second day in a row that the NASD has lagged SPY and NYSE in the buying pressure… what does that mean? Well it means that for the last two days this rally was not led by TECH like previously… 

This is very evident by the heatchart here (taken near EOD)… what does it show? IT shows outside of communication services (which BTW took a big hit due to the amazon news as a whole) that TECH was the WEAKEST member today… this is a big deal… now there are two possibilities here… Market is rotating out of tech and into more small/ mid caps and going risk on because they truly believe the upside is the only way…. However, on the hand this could show that big money finally is slowing down here… I wish I had a way to show you guys for sure but the data im seeing is that the last few days has been heavily retail driven and not big money driven… 

**JPM COLLAR**

Almost exactly two months ago we were post JPM collar roll and I mentioned the history of Futes hitting the sold call level of the collar (or within at least 100 pts of it)… very rarely do we completely pass it but it is possible… my timing assumed we would hit it the 7th week of the trend but it would appear that we are doing it at week 9… 

Now the true question is…. Will this pullback like it historically has after reaching the sold call level of the collar leading into the rotation of the collar (June 30th)? 

**UNTRADABLE**

&#x200B;

I very rarely show a 15min intraday chart nor do I include it here but I think its worth it today… why? Well if you look at this chart today I would say that from 1030 until 1115am that was the ONLY time that SPY was easily tradeable today… the opening hour was extremely volatile and unforgiven… I attempted numerous times to catch plays on the way up and down and was not able to get in because SPX premiums were moving $2 in one second… just incredible movement…

If you trusted the extreme momentum of 1030 to 1115am you made some money… From there honestly I can whole heartedly say that from 1115am until EOD it was nothing but bull and bear traps… I haven’t seen so many bear traps in one day… I have never ever seen so many technicals are one time pointing to a put play only for the market to continue to push higher… just absolutely incredible movement on the markets today… This was a clear trend day as evidence by not touching or closing under 20ema all day besides one fast wick during opening hour… however, this was one of the choppiest extreme momentum days ive seen in a while… 

Ive said it before 2022 was hard mode in the markets… 2023 is turning into expert mode in the markets. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

From the daily supply and demand here we did not do anything new… we did attempt to touch 429.68 supply and id fall just short of it… this gap up has us sitting between 422.04 and 429.68 supply. 

We did however get a fake wave down (half wave) on the DMI and now the DMI is waving bullishly. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m1om0q7m3o3b1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=2663fdff9743142fd1633bd59b4c20ae1e04cb39

From a weekly stand point here we were attempting to make a new supply up until Thursday when we rallied. However, the two day pump has put us once again with no new supply and with a weekly DMI that is overbought and with a weekly chart in extreme bull momentum. 

With a closure over 427.35 weekly supply we honestly have a huge gap to our next major level which is 453.23.

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q9fmkdnm3o3b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dff3eb11b199a34ec613c287269041d50aa24996

I really zoomed out here on the daily so you can see exactly where some of these trend lines are at… we have officially broken upwards out of the red rising wedge that we have been trading in since the end of February… this now becomes a bull channel which is represented by the blue line… we are also in a shorter term black bull channel that we have been in since May 23rd. 

With a SPY daily closure at 427.92 this is the highest level that we have closed at since August 16th which was 429.7 and also was the top of the august rally and led us to our 52 week low sell off… 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o6dk2q5n3o3b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=653e4327e6a19101f47140ca5bf4f29afc940866

On the weekly we have officially closed our highest WEEKLY candle since the week of April 11th… not only that but we did close over the August peaks high and we now are in this 427.3 to 453.3 trading channel (orange). 

The weekly has closed over the weekly 8ema for 10 times in a row… that has not happened since August to September of 2021… 

With a breakout through the black and orange resistance lines… our next target is either the blue bull channel which gives us resistance at 439.4 next week or the red/ blue rising wedge at 435.23. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 416.08 -> 427.35 -> 453.23  
 Demand- 411.57  
 Support- 427.3 -> 421.9 -> 418.5  
 Resistance- 431.7 -> 436.9

Futures daily also has no change here… we are now targeting our next supply at 4311… DMI also now in a half wave down which means we are waving up bullishly.. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

On the weekly timeframe here we have now bounced off 4130 demand (after establishing it) and have pushed through 4193 and 4384 supplies… this means our next upside target is 4540… Weekly remains in a bullish DMI wave up and bullish extreme momentum… at this point it is absolutely silly to short this. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

Since I showed such a far out chart on SPY I will show more zoomed in here on futes… we have broken through the red rising wedge which now makes this the red/ blue bull channel. We are also in a almost month long black bull channel.

The resistance of this channel is 4357 and support is 4203 for Monday. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2m0f63xo3o3b1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=0daef95d367c701168a8cea98ddaa972ed1a3c25

On the weekly timeframe here we have broken through the shorter term black and red rising wedges… which pretty much solidifies us in this blue bull channel since early march. Channel resistance is 4420 and support is 4168.

Futures also is notching out just barely its highest close since April 2022. We are also coming in hot on these 4300 CC of the JPM collar and in two weeks will be at the 11th week post collar roll…

With this closure over 4280 we officially are in the 4280 to 4540. 

FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4193 -> 4284 -> 4540  
 Demand- 4130  
 Support- 4280 -> 4238 -> 4215  
 Resistance- 4238 -> 4392

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Interestingly enough here honestly QQQ daily looks very weak… weak enough that if you had the grit one could actually short QQQ over the weekend… however, we are in daily and weekly extreme bull momentum so you are severely fighting the trend which is why I do not recommend it…

We are now sitting between 352.8 and 357.09 supplies… This doji candle could lead to a slight pullback and retrace to put in a new supply at 354.64 on Monday… support would be 347.93 if we did that… the DMI is still waving down and on Monday should complete that wave down… 

To the upside our target remains 357.09 and 361.7

**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hr0ez5up3o3b1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=2668702bd0d320d53cbb910a9fa7eaa1ef5b0a52

QQQ weekly is absolutely begging for a pullback with a weekly DMI and supply/ demand indicator about as overbought as it possibly can be… This candle could as a weekly hanging man lead to a retrace next week… If we did that we would definitely add a new supply at 354.85. Our target for a bounce would be the weekly 8ema… This also is QQQs highest weekly close since the week of April 4th 2022. 

If we continue this upside run next week we have a supply at 361.85 to watch and then from there we have a pretty big resistance level at 382.9-384.54 to keep an eye on. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 330.67 -> 361.85  
 Demand- 322.47 -> 382.9 -> 384.54

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sfi1947q3o3b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a7de277dc50c6c68970a1f5b6b0fa8693854de

Yesterday I mentioned there was a high probability that we would get the VIX into the 14s… now I did not expect it to go as low as it did but absolutely incredible drop on the VIX… Here is some fun facts about just how low the VIX is right now… 

Today- LOD 14.42, Close 14.6  
 October 21st 2021- LOD 14.92, Close 15  
 June 29th 2021- LOD 14.1, Close 16.03   
 July 2nd 2021- LOD 14.25, Close 15.08  
 February 19th 2020- LOD 14.21, Close 14.38

This is the 3rd lowest level the VIX has hitting since Pre-COVID… this also is the lowest level that the VIX has closed at since Pre-COVID…

At these levels… the VIX is saying “we are at pre-covid fear in the markets and we are at pre-covid bull market levels.” 

Just for correlation here… SPY closed at 338.34 on Feb 19th, 433.72 on July 2nd, 427.7 on June 29th and 453.59 on October 21st… On average that means of the 4 lowest VIX readings in the last almost 2.5 years… SPY has an average closing price of 413.33… however, as you can see in July and June SPY was at the 427.7 to 433.72 level which is nearly perfect correlation to where we closed today…

Now today up until 130pm felt like an absolutely massive win mentally for me… I recognized the market and the trend… I recognized that the “perfect put opportunity” was actually the call entry in disguise… and I did really really good capitalizing on that and was up quite a bit… however, then came the 130 timeframe… 

It all went downhill getting stopped out attempting to play the support bounce with a call… and then from there I lost on two puts in a row on what looked like the worlds greatest put opportunities… the one I got absolutely massively stop loss hunted on and the other I got wrecked on… 

Honestly bless up for Mondays, Tuesday and Wednesdays in the market because I will fully admit without shame that Thursday and Fridays have been incredibly difficult for me to trade lately. Honestly from someone who is data driven and highly technical based in what I do… it appears that Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday has been extremely technical based and flows as one would expect both up and down.. however, we get to Thursday and Fridays and its like the market just throws everything out the window and does whatever it wants… highly frustrating… looking forward to the weekend to mentally reset and tackle this market again Monday!",2023-06-02,16,23

As we gear up for another week, let's take a look at the economic calendar, specifically focusing on Monday's lineup. At 8:30 am Eastern Time, we begin with the release of the Empire State manufacturing survey for the month of May. A slight chill might run through the market, as the median forecast is currently pegged at a less-than-optimistic -5.0. This is a dramatic swing from the previous 10.8, indicating a possible shift in the manufacturing sector.

However, the day's events are far from over. Concurrently, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will make a televised appearance, promising a rich discussion and invaluable insights into the current economic landscape.

Finally, the morning's agenda concludes at 9:15 am with a presentation from the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari. His remarks are always keenly anticipated and will certainly provide much fodder for market analysis. So, as we embrace the new week, stay tuned for a Monday filled with informative and potentially market-moving events.

**Daily Chart**

Bears failed to close under 408.87 and the gap at 408.64 - 402.72 remains protected. We have liquidity at 414.89 and a gap at 414.77 - 415.27 that bulls will try to overcome this week. A close above 415.27 opens the door for a liquidity grab at 417.62 and 418.31. Bears need to take out prior day low at 408.87 for the 408.64 - 402.72 gap fill.

Bears swept the previous day's low at 409.97 and grabbed liquidity at the order block from May 10th. Buyers came in with increased volume. We saw a character change at 410.70 and swept liquidity at 411.58. We have resting liquidity above at 412.01. On the late bounce, bulls created a fair value gap at 410.47 - 410.80 and 410.39 - 410.27, currently holding as support AH. On the way down, bears left a few fair value gaps at 412.40 - 412.52 and 412.93 - 413.16 that bulls will look to fill on Monday. The current price action favors the bulls here.

As you can see that we are currently in the sell side premium as we are below the 50% retracement at 411.67. Shorting at the current price doesn’t look attractive to me.

If the fair value gaps hold pre-market and we have a gap up, here are the sell-side discounts. Note that these would be points of reversal where we could see a failure and more upside.

If the 409.59 - 408.87 order block fails, bears will begin to fill the daily gap at 408.64 - 402.72. Here are some internal downside targets within the 1H order block.

**1H Chart**

Bulls came in 170.69 - 171.14 order block. We have a change of character at 170.67. Close under the character change on the hourly, and price action will favor the bears to test buy-side discounts. We have liquidity sitting at 169.00 with buy-side discounts at (50%) 168.62, (62%) 167.18, (70%) 166.23, (79%) 165.15, and (100%) 162.54. We have a 166.34 - 165.08 order block and 166.34 - 166.70 fair value gap within the buy side discounts that could offer some support. Be mindful that we have equal lows that could get swept at 162.66.

We found resistance at the 176.14 - 174.10 order block as we put in equal highs. We have untapped liquidity within the order block at 176.15. Above 176.15, and we have an order block at 177.99 - 179.60.

This cup and handle is playing out beautifully which gives us a soft target of 402.6 for EOW. However, I continue to see a bigger downside target of 399. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r04zz8udkawa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f67f95fccf0c2458c5f2b89a18ee531141fb7b

While some say TA doesn’t work and that its all fake… analyzing the past can be predictive of the future… this is as of now playing out perfectly for the weekly close back under 407.3 which should start the next bigger leg down. 

**Calendar**

Tomorrow we get more jobless data and GDP… currently the alantafed nowcasts says GDP is going to take a huge hit tomorrow. If we take a huge hit GDP like that that could put us back on the path to see a recession by the EOY.

We are seeing a “beat” on META but if you read between the lines… this forward guidance is real dog water if you ask me. 

Im starting to remember why I just as a blanket statement refuse to play earnings… at least it was a small lotto and about 30% of it paid for when I repositioned.

On a daily timeframe here we did have a 405.17 supply that we did come down to finally take out. We have officially cleared out all the supplies that were left down below except for one at 399.07… for me until we establish a new demand (support) my target will remain at 399.07.

One thing that I said I was looking for today was a bounce and retest of the daily 20ema… I actually expected us to put in a green day but instead we actually tested it and hard rejected and closed under critical support of 405.2… Now that we have closed under 405.2 we have a very clear move down to 399 and possibly 390.. the thing to know about SPY is that it is very consistent with its channels. What I mean is SPY likes its ranges… now that we have fallen out of the 405.2 to 420 range we should start re-considering the 390 to 405.2 range. 

We did come down and tested the daily 50ema support but held over that. Tomorrow my target is 399 which will get us under the daily 100/ 200ema… Historically speaking SPY does not like to move through the 200ema whether bullishly or bearishly without a fight. Meaning that when we do get to the 200ema that likely will be our bounce area and 399 is where I play to take profits on my 86dte 408P. 

We have officially started a resistance line down and will keep a close eye on that along with 405.2 and the daily 20ema. 

The question now is can this META “beat” actually hold SPY up… because clearly google and MSFT couldn’t. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 399.1 -> 412.6

Futures confirmed the 4117 as resistance (not a new supply just back tested and held as resistance) and here we are seeing a push down to 4040/4055 supply to take those levels out. I remain bearish and until a new demand (support) is established our target should be this 4040/4055 supply.

Futures is set attempting to hold this 4081 support line after hours. However, now that we have a clear cut back test of the daily 20ema and closure under the 4095 critical support level… my downside target remains 4040/4055 which would be exactly touching the daily 100/200ema. There is potential of a bigger sell off down to 3920 but I would expect that to come post FOMC.

The VIX is a little hard to read here today… so on one hand we have a really clear and nice v bottom and we despite the doji candle did bounce to retest the daily 8ema support and closed over the daily 20ema for the 2nd time in a row… we have not done that since March 17th/ 20th. However, one could absolutely see this daily doji candle as a evening doji star reversal. 

The VIX clearly has been reacting to the FRC news and the markets are starting to finally accept some of bearishness that is ahead. GDP tomorrow morning will be incredibly interesting to see if markets start to price in a recession or not.

I absolutely struggled this morning. The volatility of opening hours was some of the highest (realized not relative) that I have seen in a while). Premiums were moving so fast it was nearly impossible to get filled and by time I did fill it seemed that we were immediately reversing. I have not had so many stop losses immediately hit in a very long time as I did today. 

Thankfully the 2nd half of the day I was really able to capitalize on price action and make it back and then some. Currently (even with my small lotto meta loss) im already over my weekly goal. With two days to go this week I look forward to putting in another profitable week. 

The hardest thing I struggle with lately is that at times I am noticing price action pushing through technical. There are a lot of times that I find myself missing the move as the technical never fully reset from say bearish to bullish to take a call… and there are other times it does reset and then it’s a fake out. 

However, the one thing I will say and I have said all of last year too is that capital preservation and risk management is the key to success… for instance at one point this morning was down about a full days profit goal… instead of revenge trading (despite getting frustrated at price action) I stuck to my rules, respected my stop losses and waited for my time to make some money. Its not always straight green and its not always easy trading every day. But no matter how good or bad of a day we are having/ have had we have to respect our strategy and our rules. 

Risk management will always be the key to long term success and profitability.",2023-04-26,3,0

Has anyone had a lot of experience with this? Wondering if people get lucky if some holders of the options let the options auto exercise. Do the holders actually have to call in to their brokers and tell them not to auto exercise? Would be good for future reference to know if I’m on the other side of the trade.

Now that we have seen one day of this… I will be very curious to see how the VIX1D does EOD with correlation to the next day. 

My next major target and potential source of a bounce on SPY is 405.2/ 4055 Futures.

Really nice beat there on MSFT EPS and revenue wise pretty much a sweep across the board.

I did not play MSFT earnings as I just honestly generally do not play earnings… though I am considering a META and AMZN lotto play… but overall looks like MSFT is going to have a nice upside move. 292 will be a major upside weekly target and resistance for MSFT. 

**GOOG**

Goog actually came in with a beat on EPS too and some pretty decent revenue beats… they also authorized an impressive 70million buyback too. 

I actually would have expected a miss on google and this is its first beat on EPS since Q1 2022. 

Puts clearly were not the play on Goog.

Taking a look at daily supply and demand here I mentioned how with the way supply and demand has been moving lately I would not be surprised to see us immediately turn around today and turn demandt back into supply… that is exactly what we did… 412 demand now becomes 412.62 supply. 

We also came all the way down and took our 409.73 supply finally. We did fall just short of 405.17 supply though. 

If we continue this sell off tomorrow our target is 405.17 followed by a bigger eow and into next week sell off to 399.07 supply. If we can take out 399.07 supply then I would be more confident in a longer term and stronger bounce to the upside.

SPY officailly has broken out of the 15 day long range of 406.6 to 415.6 with todays close. Not only that we closed our first -1%+ day since March 22nd. 

We also clsoed under the daily 20ema for the first time since March 23rd. One thing on SPY is it likes to back test the EMAs. Now I did think we could immediately turn around and reject that daily 8ema recovery from yesterday the bloody premarket made tahtjust a straight drop. We came dangerously close to hitting 405.2 today but we were not quite able to get there… I will be watching that level extremely close going forward. 

If we can break through and CLOSE under 405.2 I feel fairly confident in a sell off down to that 399-400 area. However, IF the bulls can hard bounce us off 405.2 and potentailly turn 405.13 supply into demand then I actually would favor a push back up to 412-416 leading into FOMC.

I wouldn’t be totally surprised to see an upside push tomorrow to retest the daily 20ema resistance. As long as we close under that I would remain bearish going forward. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 405.1 -> 399  
 Demand- 406.7 -> 409.2

Just like SPY futures immediately turned around and turned 4153 demand into supply (resistance) at 4157.

We did not take out any previous demands or supplies today but we did close below that key 4116 demand. We now have a fairly large gap in supply/ demand with downside target at 4040/4055. We also have a supply all the way down at 4015 that too needs to be taken out.

When I said that futures could immediately turn around and make 4160 a double top looking at the TOS chart that is exactly what I was talking about. Actually this is where my love hate relationship with TV forms as I love TV for ease of charting but its price action is “oof” sometimes… as you can see on TOS futures closed a confirmed 4157 double top but if you look below its not an actual double top on trading view.

Now the biggest thing here to note is that we too did break out and close below the 4113 to 4178 channel that we have been consolidating in for 15 days… With a break down like this on futures and spy we should 100% expect a bigger move to be had. Now prior to MSFT and GOOG earnings being released we actually were setting up for a closure under 4095 which is a majorly bearish movement. 

I will look for a possible retest of the daily 20ema at 4125 tomorrow and then look for a continuation back and closure back under 4095. If bears can get this closed under 4095 I do for see that bigger push down to the daily 100/200ema at 4040/4055. However, IF bulls can bounce us off good earnings then there is a chance that we will see a push back to 4138 resistance before attempting to retest 4160-4198 area. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4160 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4116 -> 4005  
 Support- 4095 -> 4080  
 Resistance- 4118 -> 4138 -> 4160

The VIX had an impressive day today being up about 18% at one point. Now we always have to look at the WHY… why was the VIX pumping today and SPY dumping? Well FRC said it might sell up to 100 billion in assets… why does this matter? Well this shows that this banking crisis is far from over… Markets needed a reason to sell and we might have gotten that reason finally…

Now we did see a pretty sizeable drop on the VIX by EOD but if we continue to see more banking issues we very well might see continuation to the downside despite what the big tech earnings do this week.

Whats actually interesting to me today is that probability of a 25bps rate hike next week dropped from about 88% to 77% today… people are now beginning again to think that JPOW is going to pause because of the banking crisis.

I had a field trip with my daughter today so I wasn’t able to trade but I was able to close my long term 405 puts pretty much at the LOD. I wouldn’t have minded holding these but being OTM and I was heavy in these I wanted to close and reposition. 

I am now in July 21st (87dte) 408 puts… my ultimate target for these is 399-400. IF we happen to get a rogue rip back to 415 I will happily average down there again.

**Last Week – Another positive week and an IV collapse.**

SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.

**This Week – A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn’t necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.

Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):

Perhaps driven to a degree by the banks, the IWM is showing the most bearish chart with clear bear flag consolidation.  SPY could be viewed more neutrally with price stuck in a consolidation zone between two major TLs; however, when you factor the IWM and QQQ, probabilities suggest the break will go to the downside.

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price remains stuck between two bearish levels: macro bear channel ceiling & the mico downsloping TL from the February 2023 pivot high.  A parralel channel upsloping TL entered the picture this week, which will eventually 'pinch' price to the upside or downside (probabilities favor the downside, look at the Weekly bearish consolidation).  385.65 is the support level to watch this week, the cross-point of the upsloping TL and bear channel TL.  On the resistance side, 401.05 is the nearest level which must be broken through before more major resistance around 410 can come into play.

**QQQ**:  Price stalled at the February 2023 double top; however, did not immediately reject the level.  Therefore, price could be putting in bullish consolidation.  Friday's close kept probabilities for more upside still neutral; a 3rd day of weaker close would have changed those probabilities.  Still, given the huge run-up in tech since the banking sector collapse, more consolidation may be needed before another move higher...if a move higher is what happens.  Next reisstances are 322.84 or 329.28 gap-fills, but the major resistance level is 334.42 double top from August 2022.  Major support remains the upsloping TL from the October 2022 lows.

**IWM**:  Price clearly rejected not only breaking back out from the bear channel, but also the upsloping TL coming off the October 2022 lows.  The resulting bearish consolidation (especially if you look at the Weekly chart) & the potential breakdown towards the end of last week places probabilities on further downside...but that doesn't mean we couldn't see some limimted upside by virtue of consolidation.  Nearest major support is 162.76 double bottom from October 2022; nearest major resistance remains the aforementioned upsloping TL (bolstered by the 200 DMA).

**Last Week – Another positive week and with it lower IV**

SPY was up 1.4% on the week, less than the 2.6% move options were pricing. However, once again the market had multiple swings and had about. 2.6% range. The week saw an FOMC announcement and some guidance of what’s next, but also saw some mixed signals from Treasury on deposit backstops for the banking industry. The VIX fell from 26 to start the week to 22 to end the week. The banking sector was once again the focus. The regional bank etf KRE had an 8% range for the week but finished the week where it started. XLF saw about a 5.5% range and also finished about unchanged. The 2-year yield closed the week at 3.77%, down slightly on the week and down from 5% on March 7th.

**This Week – GDP and The Fed’s Preferred Inflation Report**

SPY options are pricing about a 2% move for the week. Earnings season is winding down and the next one picks up in Mid-April. In between the market will of course be watching bank stress, but this week also sees the GDP print an important inflation report (PCE) on Friday. The SPY is about 4.5% above its 2023 lows and about 5% off its 2023 highs. With IV a bit lower now, the options market is not currently pricing a move to either level until early May:

Also open to minute bars as well. Looking to analyze locally, so any locked data on a cloud backtest/trading platform won't really fit my needs.

11uzybj_ANET,ANET,The Week Ahead & More: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM + Trade Journal,"**OVERALL**:  The Fed meeting will likely cause consolidation, but the regional banks & energy could force a move.  IWM showing the weakest chart this week with a possible bear flag forming within the bear channel.  SPY is trading at the bottom of a parallel channel, suggesting a potential small bounce given all of the MA & TL resistance directly overheard.  QQQ is pretty extended after last week's vertical move, but there is still a little room above before it hits a likely stall point.  If money leaves tech & flow back into other sectors, we could see an inverse of last's week trading...as arguably last week we saw QQQ break out from bullish consolidation, SPY continue bullish consolidation, and IWM break down from what had been bullish consolidation.  That said, on the weekly & monthly charts, we are still very much trading in a larger bearish pattern.

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price never did officially breakdown back inside the bear channel; on the contrary, it did validate its move outside the bear channel.  The repeated tags on both side of the channel ceiling, however, weakens the line for both the bulls & bears.  Price seems to be trading within an upsloping parallel channel since Fall 2022, which puts probabilities on the bear's side for an eventual breakdown & re-test of the October 2022 low.  Before reaching that level, however, there is a major resistance level at 370 by an ascending TL (which also is trading parallel to the aforementioned parallel channel).  There will be some resistance at 402 descending TL, but major resistance is the upper range of the parallel channel, which is beginning to converge with the 431.73 mid-August 2022 double top

**QQQ**:  Price did indeed tag the ascending support TL Monday before ripping higher all week, as tech saw big cash inflows from instituitons seeking comparative 'safety' from the regional banking collapse & energy breakdowns.  The near resistance levels got blown through all week, but price has not officially broken out yet from that descending resistance TL -- we need a close above 307.18 to do so.  If we get it, then that descending TL becomes major support; otherwise, major support remains the upsloping TL at 286 - 287.  Continued upside will likely pause at the 313.68 level, but if it can get through that then major resistance is between 318 - 320 which connects some pivot highs-to-lows from the past year.

**IWM**: The regional bank collapse prevented a sustained bounce of the major support level that was the bear channel ceiling, but 170 did provide support throughout the week.  The multiple closes within the bear channel, and failed attempts to get out of the bear channel, is problematic for the bulls.  This week's price action could be bear flag consolidate between 170 and those former support TLs, which could be setting up for a move to retest the October 2022 pivot low at 162.76 -- the nearest major support level now.  If upside returns, then major resistance will be the ascending TL between 179 - 180 this week -- which will soon also converge with the 200 DMA.

**Last Week – A bad week that somehow got worse**.

The week started off weak for stocks with rising treasury yields and fears of a more aggressive Fed, and got worse on Friday with a bank failure. SPY was lower by 4.5%, a move way beyond what options were pricing. Option vol spiked with the sell-off, with the VIX closing the week near 25, up from 18.50.

**This Week – Eyes on banks, treasury yields, a CPI and the Fed reaction to turmoil.**

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, much higher than last week’s 1.6%. IV now the highest it’s been in 2023. The last time the VIX was 25 was in December of 2022. To say this is a critical week for markets on the macro front would be an understatement. Options were already looking forward to an important CPI report for signs of the Fed’s next moves, but a banking failure last week, largely a result of aggressive Fed moves, throws some chaos into the FOMC guessing game.

Friday’s equity sell-off came alongside a sharp decline in short-term treasury yields, moves that would typically have been in opposite directions over the past 6 months. But the failure of Silicon Valley Bank runs the risk of a flight to safety in short-term treasuries, as well as the potential for more bank runs. The Fed will have to weigh the risks that more rate hikes will have in this new environment, or decide that the inflation fight is more important than other banks that may also be sitting on low-interest rate portfolios. The bond market reaction this week will be one to watch, especially after this week’s CPI. A cool print could give the Fed some breathing room to chill out and maybe even pause soon. A hot print and it’s anyone’s guess what happens next.

Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.5% expected move, about $376 on the downside and $396 on the upside. $376 would match the lows going back to December 28th, 2022, and would mean new lows for 2023:

11oul1o_AXP,AXP,The Week Ahead: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  SPY showing the weakest chart with a potential breakdown back inside the bear channel.  IWM closed right at its bear channel ceiling, so Monday's candle could lead it into a potential breakdown as  well.  QQQ holding up the best, with at least a minor support level between current price & its bear channel.  With prices sitting within so much support, probabilities would favor a bounce Monday; however, the regional bank sector crisis throws probabilities out the window.  We'll see...

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Potential breakdown back inside the bear channel; the prices to watch are a close below 384.32 -- or -- a close above 389.30 -- that will officially determine the breakdown (or not).  If a breakdown, major resistance is the 368.79 level of convergence between double bottom and COVID ascending TL.  If not a breakdown, then major resistance would be around 423.50 as price would be moving within a bullish parallel channel.

**QQQ**:  Price closed below the 50 + 200 DMA necktie, but just above 283.98 convergence of 100 DMA and ascending TL off the Oct 2022 lows; probabilities suggest this level will need to be tagged and therefore could see more downside early next week to hit this level.  Major support remains down at 270 former bear channel ceiling; aforementioned levels are just minor support.  First resistnace is 301.70 descending TL from the early Feb 2023 pivot high.  Major resistance is now 334.42 (now longer the 311 triple top) as the down move we are seeing could technically be all inside bar, bullish consolidation from the Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 up move.  The bull case is unlikely, given the events of this past week, but nevertheless worth mentioning because the chart is the chart, after all.

**IWM**: Price fell & closed into major support; probabilities would suggest a multi-day/week bounce from this level, ***but*** the SVB collapse, & weakness across the entire regional banking sector as a result, certainly cannot be ignored.  If downside continues, 170 should provide some support, but the next major level is 162.76 - 160.40 where triple bottom & an ascending long term TL converge.  Any bounce would see first resistance at 181.45 (gap-fill and 200 DMA), as well as 187 -- major resistance is 197 - 202 (ascending long term TL and double top).

**Last Week – A bad week that somehow got worse**.

The week started off weak for stocks with rising treasury yields and fears of a more aggressive Fed, and got worse on Friday with a bank failure. SPY was lower by 4.5%, a move way beyond what options were pricing. Option vol spiked with the sell-off, with the VIX closing the week near 25, up from 18.50.

**This Week – Eyes on banks, treasury yields, a CPI and the Fed reaction to turmoil.**

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, much higher than last week’s 1.6%. IV now the highest it’s been in 2023. The last time the VIX was 25 was in December of 2022. To say this is a critical week for markets on the macro front would be an understatement. Options were already looking forward to an important CPI report for signs of the Fed’s next moves, but a banking failure last week, largely a result of aggressive Fed moves, throws some chaos into the FOMC guessing game.

Friday’s equity sell-off came alongside a sharp decline in short-term treasury yields, moves that would typically have been in opposite directions over the past 6 months. But the failure of Silicon Valley Bank runs the risk of a flight to safety in short-term treasuries, as well as the potential for more bank runs. The Fed will have to weigh the risks that more rate hikes will have in this new environment, or decide that the inflation fight is more important than other banks that may also be sitting on low-interest rate portfolios. The bond market reaction this week will be one to watch, especially after this week’s CPI. A cool print could give the Fed some breathing room to chill out and maybe even pause soon. A hot print and it’s anyone’s guess what happens next.

Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.5% expected move, about $376 on the downside and $396 on the upside. $376 would match the lows going back to December 28th, 2022, and would mean new lows for 2023:

11o390u_JPM,JPM,"Is this are black swan event? All eyes on CPI next week… 3-10-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield Weekly Market Recap and Analysis","The question everyone wants to know the answer to is “was this a one off even with SVIB or is there contagion and this going to be a true market wide run on banks?”

The answer is know one knows for sure. I don’t know if going into a weekend right now is better or worse for this sort of situation. This has the potential to be the black swan event that puts SPY at not only a 52 week low but could easily cause a true market crash. However, if this is just a one off event and this gets ironed out quickly and in a timely fashion this actually could end up being okay. 

We are either watching before our eyes the start of the next market crash or we are watching yet again markets barely survive “the big one.” Only time will tell for sure… 

Honestly at this point unless that’s your round house or you are directly effect in a work setting the best thing anyone can do is continue to preserve capital and continue to make smart financial decisions. We despite what happens here are still likely to have an extremely bumpy 2023 and probably 2024. Remember the FED hasn’t even pivoted yet and generally post pivot is when the actual bottom is put in… so this could continue to be a rogue year or two. 

Also just because we saw some probably once in a life time 1million % gainers on SVIB the last few days does not mean that is the normal. Do not go chasing these types of crash winners… Even myself today let my winners run more than I usually do and I did it in a slightly more carefree way due to the environment. We 100% can prosper from this situation but stay humble and most importantly stay smart!

**CPI**

Next week is CPI… why does that matter? Well this is going to be probably one of the most important CPI readings we have had in a very long time.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/agvwltv7pzma1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f59cc009ab7aa2fc1bfadf0810e7b98d44806d

Now what actually is somewhat impressive and reassuring here is that the chances for a 50bps hike has now gone from almost 80% before the 830am data to now 38% chances here at market close. 

CPI is going to be extremely important as it is the last major data that we will get (we do get PPI the next day) before FOMC on the 22nd. IF we get a good CPI reading then there is a very good chance that markets are going to fully price in a 25bps hike (there could depending on this bank situation even be a case for 0bps crazy enough). However, IF CPI comes in hot (a true rebound) then we are going to go to 100% chance 50bps and with his already scare market because of the bank situation we are going to see a repeat of June CPI if not worse… 

My thoughts are this… if CPI is good this is going to take a lot of fear out of the market not only for inflation but for rate hikes. Not only that but these market algos are looking for any reason to rally us. 

With the VIX nearly breaking 30 today and SPY now back in the 380s this is set up for a massive move one way or the other. My thoughts are here that if this banking situation is calmed by Tuesday and we get a good CPI we are going to see a pretty incredible rally into FOMC on the 22nd. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Currently SPY is at 188million volume this would make today the highest volume day on SPY since February 24th which was 214 million total volume. Interesting enough that was a major bounce point… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7g0dtdc8pzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cca72021c9b158afb1056cf84e2d1f15128d98a

Taking a look at the daily supply/ demand chart here we have that newly established 405.17 supply (resistance). We are pretty much set up here (and this will likely depend on the bank issue/ CPI) for an even bigger breakdown to the 373.98/ 376.67 demand (support) from November/ December or we are set up to establish a new demand (support) potential on that 383.8 supply and make a pretty impressive push back to 388.52 and 394.68 demands (previous support now turned into resistance). 

We fell just short of 383.82 supply (support), however, there is a chance on Monday we could very well go down and touch that level. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qry44ht8pzma1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc638f5d059044efd42fac74d46d3d50df6d2fa

Honestly looking at the weekly S/D chart here it seems fairly obvious now that since really November we have just been chopping in this broad 382.2 to 412.5 channel. We are now coming in once again on this 382.2 demand (support). 

The fear here for bulls would be either this bank situation or CPI breaks us not only under 382.2 but closes us under it. IF that were to happen there is a very good chance depending on what FOMC would bring the following week that we could see a very impressive sell off down to 357.3. That 382.2 demand (support) is going to be a major level to watch. 

However, if we were to have a bullish week next week there is a very big chance that we could establish a higher demand (support) above that 382.2 level which would be bullish and I would 100% without a doubt start looking for a bigger recovery and push back to the 400s. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a5avjyd9pzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=eed66b54a2b63d9273bc6ae0efef89b50efcf38f

Taking a look at the spy daily here you can see we are in a pretty obvious massive blue falling wedge here. With this finally closing a candle below 390.1 the natural assumption would be for this to continue to breakdown to that 378 channel support. At this point we have gone from the November 395 to 405 consolidation channel to now attempting to break back down into the December 375 to 385 consolidation channel. 

SPY has officially fallen 5.7% or about $24 dollars in 4 trading days and has falling 4.3% or about $17 in the last two trading days. 

This much like that massive $12 breakout we had last week is overdue for a correction back to the upside. Now the caveat here versus that rally is that this is data/ news driven and this could turn into a bigger continuation. This was not a rogue fed speaker mentioning something to cause a rally. This is a really big deal. 

My thoughts here is that going into CPI Tuesday (granted this depends on nothing new happening with the banks over the weekend) that Monday is going to be a consolidation day. WE are very likely to see a smaller range type of day. We could easily attempt to recover back to the 390 area or we could attempt to get back down to the 380 area before EOD. I would not expect this extent of sell off to continue on Monday. However, if we continue to see sell offs like this into next week then that’s when we know this isn’t going to be just a one of bank and the true panic will set in… 

Bulls ultimate target will be to retrace 390 and breakout back to 400/405 on a good CPI.

Bears ultimate target is to break under key 378 support and make a run for the 360s with a hot CPI reading. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjqz1rv9pzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=12edde3c663739c6df5ffc237144c884f7b4fd9c

The bulls biggest concern here is that we have officially lost the key pivot point of 390.1 With the bears finally closing under this support level that is very worrisome for anyone who wishes to go long here… I will say that 390.1 is probably for the last 10 months been the most important single price level on SPY. 

Something I have talked about before but since May of 2022 until present day SPY has spent an extreme amount of time trading in the 375 to 407 range on the weekly. Of the last 44 weeks of trading… all but 5 weeks has had price action that has taken place between 375 and 407… that means that 88.6% of the last 44 weeks has at some point traded within the same $32 range… 

Of the last 44 weeks all but 13 weeks have CLOSED within that same $32 range… that means of the last 44 weeks of trading 70.5% of the time the market has closed within the same $32 range. 

I think much like I said back in 2022 this is where the majority of our trading for 2023 and possibly 2024 will take place. 

The issue we face here is that we have to ask the question… are we more likely to see 375 or 407 again? There is obviously a case to be made for both. IF you are a bear here is your perfect opportunity to take a 30-60dte put and look for 375 if not the 360s. However, if you are generally bullish now is your time for 30-60dte calls and I would look for a retest of 407.

Bulls ultimately want to see a close over minimally 396.3 next week and bears ultimately want a close under 375.6. 

SPY Weekly Levels:

Support- 382.2 -> 375.7 -> 367.9  
 Resistance- 390.1 -> 396.3 -> 403.2

Supply- 383.82 -> 405.17  
 Demand- 373.98 -> 376.67 -> 388.52 -> 394.68

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syofgreapzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c0a8916a88d20ac77d14787eceae0f902b80ca9

NOTE- this is going to be frustrating for the new week or two while the contracts roll on futures… on tradingview they already rolled, however, TOS did not roll. I will try and talk old and new contracts to avoid confusion. In general S/D will be off old contracts and price action will be new contracts. 

Today we early morning looking like we were going to attempt to hold the 3920 demand (support) and turn that into a double bottom. However as you can see that did not work out too well for the bulls. 

We after establishing that 4055 supply (resistance) have really not looked back. We were able to break through 3960 and now 3920 demand (supports). These levels will now become resistance if we attempt to breakout next week. 

On a down side here we only have 3833 demand (support) established. If we were to lose that level and not immediately establish a new demand (support) then we do not really have anything holding us up until we get to that 3683 demand (support). 

However, if the bulls can quickly establish a new demand or reconfirm 3833 demand (support) Monday and we get a good CPI on Tuesday then I would look for a breakout to the 3960 to 4055 area. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0b2honvapzma1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=761c45811184c7c814f72b422504ebc5ad6ce707

Now what is most impressive here on the futures weekly (remember old contract) is that we are actually attempting to close exactly on 3864 demand (support). That actually could end up much like when we bounced and closed two weeks ago on 3971 demand (support) which led to a really nice double bottom. However, this time it then immediately led to a double top and established a new supply (resistance) at 4055. 

With the bulls holding over this key level that dates back to the December lows we have found ourselves at a high potential bounce point. However, if we were to lose 3865 next week I would start looking for that previous 3600 demand (support). 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xc1qlodbpzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=55e1d4982fce93a0957e0fbe966200aca27834eb

Now keep in mind here contracts rolled on ES for tradingview last night so these candles are going to be a little off and you will see that levels are off… these will over the next week normalize and basically once we establish a new low and a new high it all fixes itself…

However, what you see is this bigger and broader red bear channel and we have a falling blue wedge being established within that. 

We did lose 3920 pivot point and now that would open up a breakdown to previous 3810 support. However, if the bulls can quickly take back 3920 next week this could look for a recovery back to the 4000-4050 area. 

Again so much depends on not only the banks but on CPI next week. I actually wouldn’t be surprised to see a very large either red or green week next week at all. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

I have talked about this before but the JPM collar… I mentioned on week 7 that historically that is the top or bottom and from week 7 to week 11 we see a reversion to mean… which actually is playing out beyond perfectly right now. 

IF that pattern pays out we very well could start the next move up next week. As you can see here though with losing that key 3920 pivot point we now find ourselves staring down 3860 support. That will be a major level to watch.

Bears ultimate target will be a closure under 3860 support which opens up a breakdown to 3770 support. However, bulls ultimate target will be a closure minimally back over 3975. That would open up the potential for a move back to 4000s. 

Futures Weekly Levels

Supply (old)- 4055 -> 4150  
 Demand (old)- 3600 -> 3865 -> 3970  
 Support (new)- 3860 -> 3770  
 Resistance (new)- 3920 -> 3975 -> 4050

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fsneevccpzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7becec462a7fdd87d9eae90e8b7279ea72fc1644

The VIX had an incredible day. I do not know the last time I have seen the VIX swing in price action the way it did today.. Amazingly the VIX still did not break through 30 today… however it did reach its highest level since October 25th. AT that time SPY was trading from 378 to 385 so that is actually pretty on par for the course. 

Now the question is based on VIX here is are markets risk off or risk on? IS there fear or is there not fear? 

We actually have reached the extreme fear level of 24 today for the first time since October 13th. You what is incredibly magical about October 13th? Well that was the 52 week low on SPY… that was the day that led to an incredible bounce from the 340s to the 420s. 

When I look at this I honestly think to myself that with extreme fear already set in and the VIX already elevated that unless this unwinds in an incredible way Monday that CPI is once again setting us up for one heck of a green rally. 

IF that CPI (which so far looks like it will per my estimates) puts in a lower YoY and MoM (shows that CPI is still dropping) then there is a really good chance that this market is going to put in an incredibly green day. I don’t know if will be as wild as Novembers 5.5% green day but I think we could easily see a 3-4% green day… 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/89874gwcpzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=558eb01ba9989d122f24e0be22eb7dff7e86038b

It was very clear today that the trust in the dollar fell which makes sense to see it drop like it did today. However, by EOD it did recover almost all of is losses. TO me that shows the strength in the dollar and I think that paints a bigger picture of this being a one off event as of now… 

With DXY also breaking its rising wedge this further goes with my expectations of a massive green week next week. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/408a7ledpzma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f89a4d41acca786fbb6241acbc844a29fc01c9b0

Yields as a whole today had a massive drop across the boards. Now granted I am still 100% a rookie when it comes to yields and I am learning here so correct me if I am wrong here guys! 

But with this massive drop in rates today on the 10yr (and really market wide) while SPY sold off that shows that money is running to the safe haven of the yields. Money is 100% scared right now and the broader market is scared that this could be the next major financial crisis. 

This here also sets us up (SPY) for a massive green week next week. Why well when the yields sell off the way they have here (meaning money came out of market/ risk) when CPI comes in cooler next week and the chances of a 50bps go to 0% and we even start talking about a 0bps hike we are going to see all of this scared money flow right back into the markets. That is going to cause an incredible rally next week. 

This rally is support by the way DXY is moving also. 

**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l1t90twdpzma1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f5a9fc3dca8ccf433eb901ae419621159834b5c

Today was probably my single best day I have had in 6-9months (not including lottos). This is my first perfect day (100% win rate) since February 22nd. 

Honestly today with the incredibly high volume and volatility actually felt like trading in a bull market again. All we had to do was be patient and wait for our play. Yes there was some rouge candles (mostly EOD) but almost everything from a technical stand point played out perfectly. Why is that? Well because there was BIG money in this today… when big money and big volume come in they are all trading by computers/ algos.

What have I said since the beginning? My job as a trader is to figure out what those algos are going to do next and capitalize on it. Of course we never look to get the full move and we know we are only getting the bread crumbs from the bigger piece of the pie… but today we absolutely killed it. 

Honestly today reminded me (which I haven’t felt in a long time) about how fun and easy it is trading during a bull market. I have preached for this whole bear market that the number one goal is capital preservation so that when we finally see the next bull market (and really just not a market with low volume/ easily manipulated by large orders) that we can fully reap the reward. 

I told myself (as hard as it was) last week that I would not do any more swings this week. I strictly day traded and despite being 100% correct on every swing I would have taken this week… I am extremely happy with this week and I am extremely happy going into the weekend! 

I hope you guys all have a great weekend!",2023-03-10,63,22

Wednesday, Feb 01, and the days following will bring a lot of buzz, and there will be some potential in the market. Over the past weeks and months, I have written about such events as the CPI and events like this one, the FOMC - here: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/zlba90/brief\_analysis\_for\_the\_market\_open\_dec\_14\_2022/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/zlba90/brief_analysis_for_the_market_open_dec_14_2022/)) ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/109mkak/cpi\_analysis\_and\_market\_movement\_for\_jan\_12\_2023/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/109mkak/cpi_analysis_and_market_movement_for_jan_12_2023/))

*The purpose of this exercise, like the others, is to examine the current sentiments and settings and gauge what opportunity the market presents.*

**25 Basis Point: The Consensus**

The FOMC committee is set to raise rate by 0.25% come Feb 01. This 0.25% increase is the consensus rate expected by most market participants. The question is how will the market react to the news of interest rates hike? Before we can answer that, we need to ask - why is this even important to begin with?

The simple answer - one espoused by many experts - is that interest rates affect stock prices, and it also affects the economy. We are interested in stocks and have already seen how volatile events like this can be. What happened during the last FOMC 0.50% interest rate hike? Take a look SPX chart at Dec 13, 2022 (below) to see for yourself.

&#x200B;

[SPX Daily \(FOMC Dec 13 Highlight\)](https://preview.redd.it/p6y8hv6o1jfa1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e26735bf269e81ef18cfd8927fa0892c13c0f77)

**SPX fell for five straight days after the Dec 13 FOMC Rate Increase**.

It is important to note that the conditions present during the previous rate increase (Dec 13) are not the same as the current one. Namely that inflation and all the other economic indicators (PCE, job reports, etcetera) seem to be getting better. At the surface, inflation, when compared to previous data, is cooling. But not there yet. More rate hikes are expected in the future.

We have seen how the market reacted to the last rate hike, and with that in mind, the question now is - how will the market react to this FOMC rate hike? Will the market keep running or will it fall like a hard rock from the sky just like the other two rate hikes?

To really come to a conclusion on what could potentially happen with this FOMC, we would have to work with the information we have on hand. The consensus or the expected rate is a 0.25% increase. Now we take a closer look at the chart again.

What does the chart tell us?

SPX has been on a climb since Jan 20 until it reached point \[A\] on Jan 27. What happened after it reached this point? It was forcefully pushed down the next day on Jan 30th only to quickly come back up again on Jan 31. This point \[A\] is a very critical point just from the reaction when price touched that point. If we extend that line all the way to the left of the chart, we can now see begin to see a clearer picture (see below).

[SPX ](https://preview.redd.it/m70lbko72jfa1.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=77ebab5ace5f0ced49ede82eb0ef921d7b336d57)

Do you see the picture it paints? The chart tells an interesting story.

We can see that at every run this snake makes, since Sept 6, 2022, that it always gets close to that significant point at \[A\] with line running across horizontally. When the price got to point \[A\] on Jan 30, it was pushed down, but quickly got back up the next day. This is actually bullish. But we know the reason for that. This bullish action on Jan 30 (yesterday) is, mostly, I suspect, from strong earnings of companies like XOM and etcetera. This is actually a cause for concern if we already had a bearish bias.

[SPX Bigger Picture Extended](https://preview.redd.it/lq7v6mlb2jfa1.png?width=1271&format=png&auto=webp&s=3664f51a204162b7f0132bf3d3865801dfd2f80f)

**The Verdict: Lets set this record straight.**

The price action from yesterday (Jan 30) is, no doubt, bullish. But we see that this price is fast approaching a critical price point. And this price point (the horizontal line) extends all the way left of the chart to area \[1\] which is a tight knot. We can see the importance of this area \[1\]. It is a magnet. Price slows down at this area, and this is evident in the chart with those two rectangular boxes besides it. Hence there are couple take away we can note, thus:

**& Assuming the FOMC rate comes in as expected (and it should because the conditions are getting better than it was prior), then**

*1. Price possibly rallies, first, back to \[A\] close to the price range where those knots at \[1\] are located. This would potentially be followed with more rally. ---> BULLISH*

*2. Price possibly rallies, first, back to \[A\] and then come crashing like it did on \[2\] & \[3\]. ----> BULLISH, then after, BEARISH.*

*3. The third scenario - price falls right after market open ---> BEARISH*

**&** Assuming FOMC rate comes in as 0.5% that would be death sentence for the index. Similarly if there were no hike (1000% unlikely), then the index will rocket straight into the stratosphere never to be seen again.

**Out of all these possibilities, the most plausible is \[2\] which is price rising back to \[A\] and once it hits that line then it comes straight down. But the story doesn't end there. Why? The rest of the week is really going to be a busy week with a lot of big companies reporting earnings**. Companies like META (earnings on Wed) and Apple, Amazon, & Google (earnings on Thursday). These companies make up a big chunk of SPX and the actions we see post FOMC will largely be shaped by these events.

I am not as enthusiastic on this play, nonetheless, I believe that there is some crops to be harvested with the FOMC.

Be cautious.

**SPY:**  Compared to QQQ and IWM, this index is actually lagging from a technical perspective.  It took the longest to break out of the bear channel (and just barely did not with Friday's close), it has yet to reach the last pivot high, and has has yet to re-test the bear channel ceiling.  Therefore, price remains 'stuck' between these 2x major resistance and suport levels: 410 and 398 respectively.  The facts that it 'gapped out' of the bear channel, and both QQQ+IWM have reached major pivot high support, leads me to think price will hit 410 before the Fed on Wednesday.  But the way it gave up in the final hour of trading on Friday...maybe just people taking profits into the weekend, or maybe indicating it will not reach that pivot high.

**QQQ:**  This week I'd say tech finally 'caught up' to IWM from a techincal perspective, considering it both 1) broke out of the bear channel (which IWM did a couple weeks ago) and 2) reached the last pivot high (which IWM did at the same time this week as well).  That said & of note, IWM has pulled back to re-test its bear channel ceiling (now a major support level), whereas the QQQ has not, so this is the nearest major support around 284.  Price is currently into a major resistance level, but if it can get through then next resistance is just over 311 which is the next pivot high and also a pretty big gap fill between September 12-13.

**IWM:**  Great price action from a technical perspective.  After officially breaking out of the bear channel, price went back to what turned into a major support level (as a result of the breakout), and then rallied to the next major resistance level -- which we hammered on the last 2x days.  The next major resistance level is around 196, which is a very long term ascending channel ceiling the pre-dates all the madness we've seen since COVID stimulus.  The nearest major support level remains around 181, the bear channel ceiling and now also the 200 DMA as well as the TL which lead to the failed bear flag pattern.

MSFT as I suspected “beat” again for me a beat means stock goes green not necessarily all the details… I am now two for two with Netflix and MSFT correctly predicted… next is TSLA tomorrow night. I honestly feel TSLA will see a miss but perhaps give good guidance.

This was my thesis prior to earnings… and this also remains my thesis currently.

I talked about it in premarket today that there was a very real scenario that we would see an inside day/ tight range day today as we were very over due for one of those. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cbooemgr92ea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b54f114c57376a68f02be1a09e80ae1a78275ce

Looking at the daily chart here that is exactly what we got today. Now most of the time an inside day is considered a continuation pattern therefore the pattern of bullish should continue. With the help of MSFT I do believe that we are finally going to start our push to 405.2. If bulls can conquer 405.2 we are well on our way to touch 410 before we get to FOMC next Wednesday. 

The bulls also back tested support at the daily 200ema today and managed to hold it closed back to back candles over the daily 200ema. The bulls really struggled to break through and hold over 400.6 today. That will be the biggest resistance to watch tomorrow, however, with this green after hours if that holds we could see a gap up over it and not have to worry about it. 

The last remaining bear market resistance line comes in at 402.4 tomorrow. 

SPY Key Support- 398.9 -> 396.7 -> 395.9 -> 393.6

SPY Key Resistance- 400.6 -> 401.6 -> 405.2

Taking a look at futures prior to the MSFT earnings release we were actually seeing a worrisome double top at 4035 for the bulls. However now that we have a nice push here we have broken that double top and presumably will see continuation tomorrow. Futures also closed a full candle over the daily 200ema for the first time since December 1st. 

One thing to keep in mind on SPY and Futures is that the daily 50ema is getting ready to crossover the 100ema for the first time since February. 

Futures Key Support- 4035 -> 4020 -> 4007 -> 3985

Futures Key Resistance- 4055 -> 4080 -> 4095

Taking a look at Tesla here I was actually very tempted into a 30dte short position on TESLA. However, almost all of the previous earning days on tesla besides one were very flat. 

Tesla reports tomorrow after the bell and I do expected a miss on it. IF we get a rogue beat or amazing guidance we could end up seeing a very large green day on Thursday for tesla. 

We are looking at a possible evening star doji pattern forming here on Tesla with a double top rejection at 143.9. 

Still riding this blue bull channel here Tesla has officially crossed its 8ema over the 20ema. 

Tesla Key Support- 139.4 -> 136 -> 133.3

Tesla Key Resistance- 143.9 -> 146.2 -> 150 -> 154

The VIX had a potential bull flag formed, however, with this rejection of the daily 8ema and closure back under 19.7 that is now negated and we should look for further downside which would align with the thought that SPY will continue its climb to 405 to 410.

Overall today was a really tough day to trade. Very low volume and very low ranges do not make for great trading. 

I was able to keep my streak of my first two plays of the day being green for the 6th day in a row now alive which is great! 

I did close my 14dte calls after hours on that huge spike. However, I am back in some 402C 14dte now with an expectation of a move to 405.2 

I still remain bullish until otherwise proven. It definitely seems I am one of the few bulls right now. I don’t think earnings season is going to bring the massive dump many are calling for. I also don’t know if FOMC gives the reaction many are hoping for… though I will be cash until after the FOMC meeting is done.",2023-01-24,12,5

Of note, it looks like neither the SPY nor the QQQ will officially break out of their bear channels...at least not today, unless either or both shoot up in the final minutes, I guess.  The SPY currently look the most 'at risk' of failing the breakout entire, by closing back down inside its bear channel.  QQQ looks slightly more comfortably above, bolstered by the gap-fill support level it is sitting on top of (having just filled it yesterday).

10jp5mp_JNJ,JNJ,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // NFLX JNJ LMT UUP,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors added to the up-moves from Friday, and all are now out of the bear channel resistance.  My bias is neutral-to-positive in the coming days-to-week timeframe, basically leading into the Fed statement; I could see consolidation & 'floating up' into that speech.  From a technical perspective, there are numerous resistance levels lingering just above where the current price action is, so a little more upside into the Fed would be a good thing to see before we ultimately head lower in the weeks-to-months timeframe.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- but compared to QQQ, much less 'conviction' in the move, as it closed just over the TL.  Price must close above 402.65 before re-entering the bear channel; if it can, then the descending TL becomes major support.  Major resistance is 410.49 pivot high.   Major support is flag's top at 387.41, which is also now converging with the flag's ascending TL which helped lead to this breakout.

**QQQ:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- and compared to IWM, more similar volume vs Friday's move higher.  Price must close above 290.21 before re-entering the bear channel for that descending TL to be viewed as a major support level.  Nearest resistance is 293.66 the 200 DMA, with major resistance at 296.88 pivot high.  Major support remains the  274.78 flag's top and ascending TL convergence.

**IWM**: Another solid move up; however, note the significantly less volume today vs. Friday's candle.  Another up day on even lighter volume may suggest exhaustion. Major resistance is 189.56 pivot high. Major support is around 177 ascending TL from late December.  I would like to see either some more time or a 'higher high' be put in before I believe the bear channel descending TL will offer much support.

10jp5mp_LMT,LMT,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // NFLX JNJ LMT UUP,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors added to the up-moves from Friday, and all are now out of the bear channel resistance.  My bias is neutral-to-positive in the coming days-to-week timeframe, basically leading into the Fed statement; I could see consolidation & 'floating up' into that speech.  From a technical perspective, there are numerous resistance levels lingering just above where the current price action is, so a little more upside into the Fed would be a good thing to see before we ultimately head lower in the weeks-to-months timeframe.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- but compared to QQQ, much less 'conviction' in the move, as it closed just over the TL.  Price must close above 402.65 before re-entering the bear channel; if it can, then the descending TL becomes major support.  Major resistance is 410.49 pivot high.   Major support is flag's top at 387.41, which is also now converging with the flag's ascending TL which helped lead to this breakout.

10jo140_GE,GE,Bulls continue to show unbullievable strength… 1-23-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"I hope everyone had a great weekend. As I mentioned last week and really for the last 2-3 week I am bullish on the markets and the bulls notched another win today. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tnjfhkf42vda1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb5e765033d626120d019dc8ef02a4e9caf9c0fd

Doing a slightly zoomed out look today on the daily chart to show you a few things I am eyeing. The first is the “we are here” tag from back in November. If you remember in October we did a ton of consolidation before we started out leg up. That was followed by an aggressive pullback and then that led to a bigger push up before we entered the consolidation in December around CPI. I believe we are in a similar time period. 

We have FOMC next week and as of right now it seems all but ensured that we will get a 25bps hike. This is bullish for markets and I believe many are expecting the fed to pause after this hike. A pause come when we go to no rate hike or decrease of rate hikes. Now this is NOT the pivot yet as we need a negative bps for that… however, if JPOW next week confirms after this meeting we are going to pause (0bps) and see what the inflation does… I think we are without a doubt going to tag that 417.74 bear market pivot line and break into a new “bull market.” That is my current thesis and currently what I believe is that we are on a road to at least 410 and we very well could breakout as high as 427 before FOMC next week. 

However, on the of chance that JPOW says we need additional 25bps or like some of the other fed members mentions that they still want to see the federal funds rate higher and the wanna continue with 25bps for a while… then I think that will top our rally and bring a bigger retracement much like what happened in September and December post FOMC. 

One very bullish thing to note today is that we had a breakout triangle on the daily formed and we clearly broke through that resistance today. Many people cited that the previous bear market trend line (green on my chart) that was at 399.7 was still valid and would reject us… however, we have clearly broken through that and we are clearly over that line with another close… the last bears defense comes at the red line which is the current bear market resistance line. That level is 402.6 tomorrow. If bears can hold us under that line then there is a chance we come back down to 390. However, the bulls were able to close over the daily 200ema finally. If they can close a full candle over that 398.1 level tomorrow that will be very bullish going forward. If the bears take back the daily 200ema tomorrow at close I will re-evaluate the road to 410. 

Key support- 399.1 -> 396.8 -> 395.9

Key resistance- 401.5 -> 405.2 -> 407

&#x200B;

Futures also look incredible bullish with a nice support bounce off the daily 8ema and closure back over the daily 200ema with a break through of that triangle. Bulls wanna try and close at 4035 if possible in the next 45 minutes. 

One key note here is we broke out and touched 4055 and rejected hard there earlier today. That level is the December CPI resistance. That will be a key level we watch tomorrow. 

Support- 4020 -> 4008 -> 3985 -> 3965

Resistance- 4035 -> 4055 -> 4080

Tesla looked extremely bullish today and extremely strong today. Tesla came out swinging putting in a nice 7.74% green day. Tesla has officially closed 10 candles OVER the daily 8ema…. This is the first time it has accomplished that since the September sell off began. It has not closed 11 days over its daily 8ema since July. 

There as a red rising wedge on the daily, however, bulls pushed through that and now turned that into the current blue bull channel. With a closure over the daily 8ema and a presumptive 8/20 ema crossover on Tesla I am very much so still expecting some upside. However, much like last week after a big push up we very well could expect a retrace to retest support before we continue this push upward. 

With earnings on Wednesday Tesla really is a wild card. 

Support- 139.5 -> 136 -> 133.4 -> 128.7

Resistance- 143.8 -> 146 -> 150

There is a potential bull flag formed here on the daily chart of the VIX. However, we closed lower than Friday and we did break the support line. We are still holding that 19.7 support and do not seem to want to hold under neath that for very long. 

**Daily log-**

Started the week off right with some nice wins on SPY and Tesla 4dte swing calls… closed them unbelievably early but I don’t like to mess around with swings especially short dte… that is the hard thing about swings. IF you are right it’s a win and you pretty much have to take that win right at open or be ready to lose it all. The best way is always to recognize the win or loss and reposition with what the intraday gives you.

Nice green day to start the week off right. This is now my 5th green Monday in a row! I was interested in some SPY 18dte calls overnight for a play for that 405 to 410 touch but decided to sit cash and see what tomorrow brings.

The biggest thing I expected yesterday was that 390.1 would be tested. I fully expected that but I really did not fully expect us to open at 389 like we did. I actually was pretty surprised to see that red of a move after hours/ pre market and open red like that. The question we get to ask ourselves yet again is… is this a short peak or a short bottom? The best answer I can give you right now is that we do not have enough information to answer it yet… but tomorrow will give me guidance for at least the next 7-14 days… 

I am watching 390.1/ 3920 VERY closely. IF we close over those levels I am very bullish and I fully expect a push over 400 before 380s again. However, if we close under 390.1 tomorrow I am going to close my 15dte SPY calls and will look to open some puts. 

We have not closed a fully candle below the daily 8ema for the first time since January 5th and closed back below 390.1 for the first time since January 9th. As you guys know 390.1 is a major pivot point in the channel. I look forward to tomorrows close for more information on where we might be going next. 

The most interesting thing about today is that we found a very nice bottom at 387/388 area and made a ton of progress all day long and we suffered one of the bigger power hour sells off on seemingly no news I have seen in a long time. A total $2.4 sell off on a day we only moved a total of $3.82 is quite impressive and frankly seems unwarranted. 

I am watching closely for this doji candle to turn into a beautiful morning doji star pattern that breaks us back to the mid 390s tomorrow. 

Support- 387.8 -> 386.3 -> 384.4

Resistance- 389.4 -> 390.1 -> 391.5

&#x200B;

Futures here I am watching closely this 3920 level at close here… that is my big pivot area here on futures. 

We are seeing closer to a hanging man reversal candle here on futures then we are seeing a doji. When we were trading closer to 3930-3935 it was far more clear and convincing of a reversal to the upside tomorrow. However, this pattern very well could turn out to be bearish. With a rejection and closure under the daily 8ema and closing under the daily 20ema that is bearish. However, we need to see what tomorrow does and more importantly where this weekly candle for spy and futures closes. 

Key support- 3895 -> 3872

Key resistance- 3920 -> 3945 -> 3965

&#x200B;

Tesla is one that I am not quite sure how I feel yet. There is a really nice rising wedge formed here. However, after that huge break out to 136 its found support here at the daily 8ema. Realistically until we break through that daily 8ema I struggle to be bearish anymore. When I played puts before and was bearish it was when we were looking to reject daily 20ema and cross back under the daily 8ema and inevitably touch 123 again. However, Tesla is attempting to find support here to continue this move up. 

We are going to have two key levels at 128.9 (daily 20ema) and 125.6 (daily 8ema) tomorrow. Rising wedge support is at 126.5 tomorrow. Three key levels to watch tomorrow. 

Support- 126.5 -> 125.6 -> 122.5

Resistance- 128.8 -> 131.5 -> 136.6

&#x200B;

one of the biggest thing that is keeping me bullish here is the VIX. As you can see we have a really nice falling wedge that’s been forming over the last 3 months. 

We had a convincing push and breakout here on the VIX over the daily 8 and 20ema, however, we had a massive rejection off that blue trend line and closed with a beautiful evening start doji. With spy showing a morning star doji and VIX showing evening star doji that is not two patterns together I would like to bet against. While macro we could still be bearish I am short term bullish for now.   
   
 

If we close under 390.1 tomorrow and close over the daily 20ema of the VIX that might change my mind though. But I think we are going to see some bears very surprised with a push back over 390.1 if not higher tomorrow. 

We do have a ton of earnings next week:  
 Tuesday: MSFT, TXN  
 Wednesday : Tesla, IBM  
 Thursday: INTC, V  
 

This is the first wave of earnings before the next big wave the first week of February. There is a case to be built of a final run up next week or even the next two weeks. Netflix very well could be setting the tone here.

This has been so much nicer than the scalps that I was forced to trade in order to keep my head above water.

10akun4_UAL,UAL,Daily Review & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**: Today's move higher saw our first pierce of the bear channel celing, courtesy of IWM.  With the upcoming long weekend, I expect volume will be light tomorrow which may cause price to drift higher, sending SPY above the bear channel as our second major index to do so.  That said, I am still in the bearish camp, as on the macro time frame everything we are seeing is occuring at the lower range of the down move we saw over the entire couse of 2022.

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price tagged the 200 DMA before pulling back.  Major resistance remains immediately overhead at 399.40 to 401.35.  Given the potential breakout of the bear channel in the IWM chart, I could see price floating through those levels tomorrow on light, pre-long weekend volume.  If price reverses, then 387.41 flag's top will offer some support, with major support at 382 ascending TL through the former bear flag.  Antoher major support level is at 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).

**QQQ:** By comparison from a technical perspective, a 'quiet' day, but today's close did officially turn 274.78 into a support level -- and it is also being bolstered by an ascending TL.  The first major support is 259.08 flag's bottom & previous pivot low, followed by an even more major level at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.  Nearest resistance remains the 282.33 gap-window, with major resistance at 286.51 gap-fill and 288.50 descending TL channel ceiling.

**IWM:** Yet again a leading indicator, price punched through & closed above the bear channel.  Price must close above 185.95 before dipping back into the channel to officially turn the TL into a support level.  Given the coming holiday weekend, I would not be surprised to see price float into the 188 - 190 resistance level tomorrow. If price reverses, then 180.19 is nearest support, followed by 176.80.  The first major support level is that ascending TL cutting through the former bear flag.

**Type**:  Sell to Close  
**Symbol**: UNG  
**Return**:  + 6.58%  
**Entry Date**:  1/05/2023  
**Avg Price**:  11.62  
**Exit Price**:  12.38  
**Short Size**:  2%  
**Thesis**: Price popped this morning right back into the same area it failed to move through on Monday (which I missed & did not exit); therefore, I closed my position as price seemed to weaken.

**Type**:  Sell to Close  
**Symbol**: CTSH  
**Return**:  + 1.78%  
**Entry Date**:  4/26/2022  
**Avg Price**:  63.96  
**Exit Price**:  65.10  
**Short Size**:  1%  
**Thesis**: I entered this trade a while ago, yet failed to ever add to the position (hindsight is always 20/20).  I had just recently planned to transition this swing trade into an investment position, at which point I would've begun writing covered calls against it to chip away at my average price.  Put this morning's pop sent the trade in the money...I set a stop at 65.10 thinking it would give price the ability to consolidate for another leg higher...but I ultimately got stopped out.  Seeing how this had traded as low as $51 recently, I am more than happy to take even the smallest win here.

**Type**: Short to Enter  
**Symbol**: RIOT  
**Short Price**: 6.00  
**Short Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: Big run up here as BTC broke $19,000.  I am using TA across both the RIOT and BTC charts for this trade, as both are hitting major resistance levels.  My target for this trade is $5 - $5.15, which corresponds to the previous pivot high as well as a 38.2% Fib retrace of this move.  I will add another tranche to this position at 7.28 next pivot high, which is also where the 200 DMA is coming down into.

**Type**: Short to Enter  
**Symbol**: F  
**Short Price**: 13.53  
**Short Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: 11-days into this vertical move.  I entered as price filled a gap from December 14th and hit the 200 DMA.  If price continues higher, I will add another tranche at 15.  My target for this trade is 12.11 - 12.22 which is the 20 DMA and 50% Fib retrace level, respectively.

**Type**: Short to Enter  
**Symbol**: UAL  
**Short Price**: 50.00  
**Short Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: Amazing vertical move across the entire industry it seems.  I entered this trade on the TL hit and 50.00 round number, and will add another 0.5% tranche at 52.50, then another full 1% position at 55.  My target for this trade is between $46 - $46, depending on how price moves lower after such over extension.

**OVERALL:** Today's price action saw some very cool levels being hit or nearly hit from a technical perspective across all 3x majors. The gap-up at the opening bell, followed by an immediate sell-off and then consolidation at the lower range of the 10-min chart candles suggests a bear-flag was built at that very micro, intraday time frame. This is not to say tomorrow will be a continuation of that down move, just that price definitely consolidated from about 11:20 until the closing bell at the lower range of the trading day.

**SPY**: 11x days into this bear flag & trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself. Price just missed doing the same head fake / fake out as we saw on IWM. If price continues lower, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low. If price turns around & heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** Given today's price action, I will amend my ""bear flag"" measurement from December 13th to December 22nd, which means today's candle could be the 6th day of what is becoming a bear flag pattern. Today's move to just miss that ascending TL (which had only recently become a resistance level) played out perfectly as price pulled back from the level. If price continues lower, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. If price turns back around & heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 270.70 (that same ascending TL), but it could be 'weaker' now. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st (also where the 20 DMA is sitting). Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 11x days into this bear flag & trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself. Beautiful pierce of the flag & 20 DMA, which I suspect caught many traders off guard, as price pulled back from that level into the flag as a head-fake / fake break out. If price continues lower, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows. If price turns around & higher, then the nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

I mentioned this pattern yesterday in my TA on SPY. With 378 clearly being “bottom” for the foreseeable future I envision this to be our next pattern to play out. This would give us a rally in January. I would start to eye a retest of 405 to 415 area through the month of January. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ho5lhkrb349a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dea74b9e8f454c5d6923a0c09038e4bb5daa4dcf

I started to analyze the 2022 bear channel weekly movement. When we take a look at it you can see we have this cycle of peak at channel resistance -> short drop -> short peak -> full dump -> retest of channel resistance. We have been in this pattern all year long. We did however, break through that channel resistance of the 2022 bear channel the day of CPI. However we fell through it and we have not touched it since. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nn5xmq8c349a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9b53adb8d46fcd92425a67374aa7406726e9f78

Taking a look at the cycle you can we just had a 21 day 8.7% drop for our first short drop… this SHOULD be followed up with about 50-75% of the length and 56% of the distance recovery… so that means we should be looking at about a 10-14 day 4.8% recovery minimum. 

That would put SPY at the week of 1/16 to 1/20 near 393 minimum. 393 on the weekly timeframe is actually the red bear channels resistance line. That is my target for next week. 

Taking a look at the structure of the last two weekly candles you can see they are back to back gravestone dojis that came down and bounced off that 376 area and their candle bodies held support at 383 level too. 

We have been waiting for the 390 resistance retest and I believe that is our target for next week. 

Key support- 375.6 -> 363.7   
 key resistance- 390.1 -> 398.8 

&#x200B;

Taking a look at the futures daily chart you can see we are in a massive breakout pattern right here. We did double top off that 3870 key level, however, as you can see we closed out with a massive wick to the downside. With this close this should be seen as a bullish candle for Monday. I would be shocked to not see us breakout over 3870 Tuesday and I will be eyeing a touch of 3910 to 3920. That would be a 1.1 to 1.3% green day on Tuesday.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lfy8wb7d349a1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=180540840721fe60b0a267f539fd84f19feb5af3

Besides the June quarterly the last 3 out of 4 quarterlies have opened green. The biggest open was 1.1% at the September quarterly and the lowest is 0.28% for an average of 0.58% green open on the day after quarterly. 

Something else I had noted for Tuesday DTE options is that the IV closed in the 11s. This is VERY low for SPY IV. Generally almost every morning opens with an IV of 25-30% and slowly ends around 20%. With an IV pump and high probability green open I found a call swing worth the risk for Tuesday. That was also a very bullish finish to the day, week and year. The bears no matter how many times they tried to break us down the last two weeks were not able to. 

My only hope for 2023 is that we finally get some real direction and that the technicals come back into play better. 

&#x200B;

I mentioned the inverse head and shoulders on SPY daily and honestly its kinda ugly but I do see it forming here on futures weekly. I could see us reading 4200 by middle of February.

As bearish as I want to be and as bearish as I believe the markets tried to be today it just couldn’t do it. The bears do not have the momentum right now to break us down further. 

&#x200B;

A couple important things to note ahead in the month of January. 

First up on Wednesday (2 days into the new trading year!) we have FOMC minutes (I will have a detailed trade plan posted sometime this weekend for that!)… followed the next day by ADP followed by unemployment rate (The last three have resulted in 1%+/- openings)… And then finally the week after that we have CPI on Thursday January 12th. 

A big first two weeks of the year. The question is…. Will FOMC minutes remind the market of how bearish JPOW was or much like in November where we had a massive red FOMC the markets didn’t care and we ripped on FOMC minutes hitting the wire. 

I remain going forward bullish until markets prove me otherwise… things that COULD prove me otherwise… 1. Closing AND holding below 378. 2. VIX popping and holding over 25+ or 3. A huge miss on CPI. I don’t at this moment forsee any of those coming true… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2f7tnvne349a1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=5341a6ce35b2a4a85c9d411b6d6ebf2e95a119cf

And then there was… Tesla…. 

After absolutely being slammed the whole month of December I have to give it to the tesla bulls and say they finished on a very positive note! 

Taking a look at our cycles we can officially say we have closed out our downward cycle on Tuesday. That remains the longest and biggest drop tesla has seen during this sell off period. 

Looking at the trend we should be expecting about a 4 day 14% rally. However, we have to remember that Tesla put in double its usual sell off… perhaps we get double the recovery? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cleb1v5f349a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=498724e307dd90f47e811a2c1c9f8a6144672016

Taking a look at the tesla daily I have to say this candle body structure is both impressive and confusing. Yesterday Tesla put in a 8.08% green bullish day… however, today only putting in 1.12% green actually was a bullish engulfing candle of a green candle. That is not something you see too often at all. 

Things to note here is that we are sitting at key 123.2 resistance and we did not quite touch the daily 8ema. SPY is going to need to breakout over the daily 8ema in order for me to be bullish more than Tuesday. However, if this is a double recovery on Tesla we could be looking for sometime before 1/9 for Tesla to retest the 136 to 140 area. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b94d01nf349a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b77879465ccd9755b0896ae526473135520fdcc

I mentioned last week in my weekly TA that tesla is in a cycle of 3 red weeks followed by a recovery/ consolidation week before the next leg down. Taking a look at the weekly here Tesla could have an impressive pop all the way to 147 and still be in that broadened red bear channel.

There also should be noted a critical bounce occurred off that 11.4 support that dates back to 2020. With that level holding and Tesla receiving a decent bounce and forming this possible morning star doji I am bullish for tesla going into the first week of the year. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/744jns2g349a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=13f26d21375b120dfdca52f577d76f6b31ccaf59

The VIX has been detached from reality but at times the structure remains impressively accurate. We failed now for 6 days in a row for the VIX to close a candle over 22.2. With these 6 rejections here (in addition to the 8 out of 9 last daily candles that have held 3845 support on futures) I remain once again bullish for next week. 

This evening doji star pattern formed here on the VIX should take the VIX down to about 21.2 Tuesday. We as you can see inside of this blue bear channel are maintaining a breakout/down triangle also. Unless the VIX opens over 22 (+1.5%) at open and all day that will be a break through of support and that should start the next leg down on the VIX and subsequently the next leg up on the markets. This movement should take us into CPI week. 

**Year in review**

Before someone says why am I not posting a broker screenshot… well I have moved money throughout the year and also changed brokers and accounts during the year and I frequently take money out of my options account. I also couldn’t find data from January as I was still working full time back then and didn’t keep records like I do now. 

But taking a look at this the biggest thing that strikes me here is a few things. 1. The fact that my worst weeks win rate was during a green week is crazy to me. But this was back in February when we had those massive $10-$14 days and we could pick up 100-150% wins like it was easy. Aint doing that shit no more that’s for sure. 

The other thing that is intriguing to me is that my average win rate on a losing and winning week is only a 6% difference. Tells you the overall power of stop losses. Also intriguing and I think really makes a statement is the fact that I had a really 2.5 month long stretch of straight struggling was still able to close out a really green year. This is where small wins over time average out to be huge wins. There is no reason to look for massive win after massive win. And if you have a really bad stretch that is okay its not the end of the world. 

Something else that really helped me this year too is that when I noticed I was struggling in June I sized down heavily on my position size and I still have not sized back up yet fully to that full position size I was using up until June. 

Overall a pretty great year despite the bullshit that 2022 presented us. I look forward to 2023 and I hope whether bull, bear or flat that we can at least get a market that is rational and obeys the technicals.

Pretty light trading today. Had that really nice swing win over night which covered some earlier losses in the week. After that the tight morning range and the absolutely mind numbingly boring price action I didn’t trade a whole lot. Took a lotto put around that big after noon dump time and took a nice win. Closed around 22% and it went on to be well over 100%...   
 

Overall honestly despite closing a green week (mostly thanks to that swing put over night… I really didn’t feel like I had my best week of trading. I would have liked to have a better week than I did but I felt like iw as struggling with the technicals this week. Felt like by time my setup finally signal a buy for something the move either never happened or it just straight reversed on us. Even today during PH which granted this was expected to be a highly volatile PH…  the 315pm candle was red and a massive gravestone doji rejecting off a key resistance level. With that double top the 1min, 5min and 15min all being overbought and volume switching over to sell… we should have seen a bigger drop but what did we see? We saw a huge pop of another 0.6% in the last 30 minutes.

Weeks like this as someone who trades with a clear cut and dry strategy it makes it extremely hard to take positions. I find myself looking at price action alone and seeing trades develop but being unable to take those trades because of how the indicators are presenting themselves. 

Tough week for sure. Hoping now that we got the collar rolled, tax loss harvesting is over and everything that we can finally see some normalcy in the markets again next week.

zzea31_JPM,JPM,End of Day SPY ramp up / Trading 0DTE,"I tend to trade zero or  one day SPY - simply buying a call or put based on my view of the charts. I usually close out my position by early afternoon but I can't help but look at the charts after closing and see that the last 60-90 minutes of every day seems to have an elevated volume level (compared to earlier in the day), and often SPY finishes well off its low. Yesterday was an exception. I noticed a nice bullish engulfing pattern at about 1:50 central time today. So I am going to look to paper trade some options towards that last hour. Anyone else trying to trade the late day ramp up? And any guesses as to what drives the up tick in late day volume? Is it all computer generated buys from the big traders?",2022-12-30,7,17

zwr0gy_HLT,HLT,Daily Review & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors continue to behave decidedly bearish.  SPY and IWM are maturing their bear flags, while QQQ continues to grind lower.  As expected, extremely light volume (even compared to last week).  The fact this light volume did not float higher shows how negative the overall market sentiment is with retail/small investors (who are likely making up the majority of this price action; institutions are largely out this week).

**SPY**: 7x days into this bear flag; price remained within Friday's candle.  Nearest support at 374.13 gap-fill which price missed on December 22nd.  Mid-support is 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd.  Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to Octover 13th pivot low.  Nearest resistance is  389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill.  Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** Price continues to grind lower; 262.46 must hold on a daily closing basis for the former support TL to not become a resistance TL.  If that level cannot hold, then 259.08 is nearest support.  Major support is the 254.26 double bottom from Octovber 13th.  Nearest resistance is the aforementioned ascending TL, then moderate resistance at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st.  Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 7x days into this bear flag; price remained within Friday's candle.  Nearest support is 170.68 the flag's low.  Moderate support is around the 169 pre-COVID high.  Major support is 162.76 triple bottom  from June, September, and October lows.  Nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high.  Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th.  Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

I executed 3x trades today: 

**Trade**: ADD x2 tranches  
**Type**: LONG  
**Stock**: TSLA  
**Add Price**: 116.45 and 110.00  
**Add Size**: 1.5% total between both tranches  
**New Avg**: 120.99  
**New Size**: 2.5%  
**Thesis**: I added twice because price fell through & to major technical levels.  My cost average is still 'in range' of reasonable targets when the bounce does come.  This situation highlights why I keep position sizes small when trading volatility -- at only 2.5% of my portfolio, I stil have plenty of capital available if price falls further.  My next add(s) will likely be $100 to $90, and will bring my position to 4-5%.  My new target is $130 to 135, but depending on how price returns to that level, $165 is not out of the question...but probabilities no longer favor that initial target.

https://preview.redd.it/4ylb661x7i8a1.jpg?width=2298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=809301b740be72a71728501831a9c8d40f5a412b

  
**Trade**: ENTER  
**Type**: SHORT  
**Stock**: PEP  
**Price**: 183.36  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: From mid-November to mid-December, price saw 3x failed breakouts while trading in upper-range of channel. Most significant is December 13th: significant gap-up, failure to hold above the previous ATH, and major bearish engulfing candle.  Since December 15th, price has formed a bear flag. I entered a small 0.5% position because 1) light holiday volume should cause price to float higher naturally; but more importantly 2) the gap-up this morning above the 20 DMA.  I will add another tranche a 186.50 -- then use a upper channel  TL tag to add a 3rd tranche depending on how price moves into that level.  Depending on the overall position size, my first target to cover is the 200 DMA at $172, followed by the lower channel TL at $165.

zvwpro_AAL,AAL,The Week Ahead: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  Macro trend is bearish.  Micro trend is bearish-to-neutral.  Last week may have formed a bear flag, but with very light volume expected this week, price could ""float"" slightly positive over the course of the week & still remain within that pattern.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Most ""clean"" bear flag of the 3x majors. Just barely missed the gap-fill from November 9th.  If price floats higher on the expected light holiday volume, it must break 389.63 to negate the bear flag.  394.30 will be a more significant resistance level since this is where the formerly bullish consolidation broke down.  If it can get through those levels, then 399.40 is another gap-fill.  Max upside is 403.73 (Tuesday) to 402.80 (Friday).  Price must get above that descending TL for the bulls to have any hope of regaining control of the macro trend.  If price breaks down this week, then 374.13 could provide some support, but likely not much because of that near-miss of gap-fill on December 22nd.  Moderate support level at 365.50 which is an ascending TL from 2016.  Major support level which could get tagged this week if price truly breaks down is 358.50 the COVID low TL -- but again, the holiday volume will likely prevent that kind of a move lower.

https://preview.redd.it/s24kl8092b8a1.jpg?width=2297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b20b50e76fec34bf0721134bd766719bc83c91e

**QQQ**:  The least ""clean"" bear flag formation of the 3x majors, perhaps because it is the only major to retrace down to a technical level on December 22nd's gap-fill.  If price floats higher this week, it must break back above the TL it broke down through last week: 275.50 (Tuesday) to 276.75 (Friday).  If it can, it will hit major resistance at 280.72 where its previously bullish consolidation also broke down.  For bulls to possibly regain the macro trend, the descending TL around 293 must be broken & held above.  Conversely, if that double-touch of the 263.32 gap-fill level weakened the level and price breaks down further, the COVID-low TL at 261 will likely not provide much support now that price has consolidated somewhat around this level.  Instead, the double-bottom at 254.26 should provide major support.

https://preview.redd.it/69x7y7ba2b8a1.jpg?width=2299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2425aec1811fc45ad01133892faa9ce81c1b1b7

**IWM**:  A clean-ish bear flag, and most notable is the unsuccessful break out on December 21st.  As a result, 175.68 will likely provide only slight resistance if price floats higher this week.  Instead, 180.19 will be major resistance, as it is not only a gap-fill but also the level where previously bullish consolidation broke down.  If price manages a serious break out, then 185.50 to 186.40 will likely be max upside; price must hold above those descending TLs for the bulls to regain control of the macro trend.  Conversely, if price breaks down this week, there are a couple support levels at 168.78 (previous COVID pivot high) and 167.90 (COVID-low TL); however, given how much price has consolidated just above these levels, they will likely only offer temporary support.  Instead, the double-bottom at 162.50 is major support and should offer a more significant technical bounce.

zqzo79_AAL,AAL,Daily Review: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**: Slight relief today. The fact it came on light volume, and more from a time-perspective than a technical level, suggests only neutral to positive bias for tomorrow's price action.

 

**SPY**: Barely retraced back into yesterday's candle. If upside continues, first resistance is 385.18 and 389.63 gap window/fill -- with 394.30 and 399.40 gap window/fill as significant resistance.  For the bulls to regain control, the failed-breakout descending TL must be broken around 405.  If selling resumes tomorrow, modest support should come at 374.13 gap-fill, followed by a decade-old ascending TL around 365 until hitting major support at the 357.70 COVID-low TL.

**QQQ:** Price failed to close within yesterday's candle, but at least it did not validate the breakdown of its ascending TL. If upside continues, first resistance will be that ascending at TL 273.90 -- followed 280.72 where its previous bullish consolidation broke down -- then 282.25 to 286.51 are gap window/fill.  Similar to SPY, major resistance remains around 295 the pivot high TL.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is at 263.32 gap-fill, then it will hit major support between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

**IWM:** The most solid retrace by any major, but on the least amount of volume.  If upside continues, first resistance will be gap-fills at 175.68 and 180.19 with major resistance between 186.40 to 185.95 at a confluence of descending TLs.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is 167.78 pre-COVID pivot high with major support  between 167.55 to 167.75 the COVID-low TL.

**Last Week – Some selling ahead of the Fed**

SPY fell 3.4% last week, a much larger move than options were pricing. The majority of the move lower happened on Monday and Tuesday and the market went sideways to close out the week. With the combination of the move lower and with the market now looking ahead to this week’s FOMC decision, implied volatility rose across the board. The VIX rose from 19 to nearly 23 and SPY IV for this week nearly 30. More on that IV anomaly below.

**This Week – Options are pricing movement this week**

SPY options are pricing a nearly 3% move for the upcoming week. About twice what options were pricing last week. The Fed rate announcement is this Wednesday of course, and option vol is high for this week relative to after. How high? SPY options this week are 29 IV compared to 21 IV for options expiring Dec 30th. QQQ vol is 34 for this week and 27 for Dec 30th. In other words, options are pricing the majority of the move for the balance of 2022 to happen this week. The expected move in QQQ this week is 3.4%, which is the majority of its expected move of 4.4% into year-end.

To illustrate the move for this week, an Iron Condor set at the expected move would be max gain if SPY closed the week between $382 and $405. That’s near where the latest rally stalled and well below recent lows of the past few weeks. Here’s how that looks on the chart:

**Last Week – Typical Holiday Trading**

SPY rose 1.6% last week, in line with the 1.5% move options were pricing. Retail stocks helped continue the recent rally and the FOMC meeting minutes confirmed some market assumptions on the Fed’s next moves. Day-to-day volatility was also subdued and volumes light. Implied volatility again fell. The VIX finished the week at 20.50, its lowest close since mid-August. VIX futures are now steeply in contango with Jan VIX futures above 25 and March above 26. SPY 30-day IV is just 19, 60-day is 20 and 90-day is just 21. So SPY options are near historical averages across the board while VIX futures continue to price high 20’s out a few months.

**This Week – Economic Calendar Picks Back Up, Culminates on Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are again pricing just a 1.5% move for the upcoming week, but option premium contracted a lot to account for no trading on Thursday and a half day on Friday to end last week. There’s nothing market makers hate more than getting plugged with premium into a quasi 4-day weekend and that explains a lot of the IV drop last week. IV typically reflexes the other way on a Monday open following a long weekend.

Last week we highlighted a possible phenomenon that falling IV after sustained high IV (like we just saw) can have a bit of a snowball effect on both option pricing and actual market movement as the selling loads the market with gamma:

>File this under a “way too early to know” category, but one thing traders should be aware of is that falling implied volatility can be a self-fulfilling prophecy on realized (actual) market volatility **The TLDR version is that it can load the market with gamma that may act as a governor on market moves as there are deltas to be bought lower and deltas to be sold higher.**

That’s something worth keeping an eye on but with the NFP Jobs number this week and the FOMC December meeting on the 14th, there are a few potential market-moving events that could keep options bid. In fact, the expected move chart shows higher volatility for this Friday and the FOMC week (note the FOMC week in particular as IV jumps from 15 to 20 and expected moves expand, it looks like a stock does into earnings):

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bk140ef9yk2a1.gif

What that means is that even if market moves stay muted for now, options will have to keep the some key upcoming dates on the radar and price an assumption of volatility those days. That effect on IV may be less noticeable in individual stocks but traders should apply the same assumptions, particularly in stocks with close ties to interest rates and currencies.

The economic calendar this week has the aforementioned Jobs Number, but some other important events like the GDP number and a Powell speech/ Beige Book.

**Last Week – Typical Holiday Trading**

SPY rose 1.6% last week, in line with the 1.5% move options were pricing. Retail stocks helped continue the recent rally and the FOMC meeting minutes confirmed some market assumptions on the Fed’s next moves. Day-to-day volatility was also subdued and volumes light. Implied volatility again fell. The VIX finished the week at 20.50, its lowest close since mid-August. VIX futures are now steeply in contango with Jan VIX futures above 25 and March above 26. SPY 30-day IV is just 19, 60-day is 20 and 90-day is just 21. So SPY options are near historical averages across the board while VIX futures continue to price high 20’s out a few months.

**This Week – Economic Calendar Picks Back Up, Culminates on Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are again pricing just a 1.5% move for the upcoming week, but option premium contracted a lot to account for no trading on Thursday and a half day on Friday to end last week. There’s nothing market makers hate more than getting plugged with premium into a quasi 4-day weekend and that explains a lot of the IV drop last week. IV typically reflexes the other way on a Monday open following a long weekend.

Last week we highlighted a possible phenomenon that falling IV after sustained high IV (like we just saw) can have a bit of a snowball effect on both option pricing and actual market movement as the selling loads the market with gamma:

>File this under a “way too early to know” category, but one thing traders should be aware of is that falling implied volatility can be a self-fulfilling prophecy on realized (actual) market volatility **The TLDR version is that it can load the market with gamma that may act as a governor on market moves as there are deltas to be bought lower and deltas to be sold higher.**

That’s something worth keeping an eye on but with the NFP Jobs number this week and the FOMC December meeting on the 14th, there are a few potential market-moving events that could keep options bid. In fact, the expected move chart shows higher volatility for this Friday and the FOMC week (note the FOMC week in particular as IV jumps from 15 to 20 and expected moves expand, it looks like a stock does into earnings):

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bk140ef9yk2a1.gif

What that means is that even if market moves stay muted for now, options will have to keep the some key upcoming dates on the radar and price an assumption of volatility those days. That effect on IV may be less noticeable in individual stocks but traders should apply the same assumptions, particularly in stocks with close ties to interest rates and currencies.

The economic calendar this week has the aforementioned Jobs Number, but some other important events like the GDP number and a Powell speech/ Beige Book.

**Last Week – Relatively Quiet, Now What?**

SPY fell 0.6% last week, its least volatile weekly move in some time. Not only was the close for the week well inside what options were pricing but the range of trading for the week was much more muted than what has been typical over the past month and a half with about a 1.8% move lower the extreme of the weekly range. Implied volatility was more or less unchanged on the week. The VIX sits around 23.

**This Week – Will Traders Get Full of Turkey** ***and*** **Gamma?**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.5% move for the upcoming holiday-shortened week, that move is down significantly what options were pricing over the past few weeks.

File this under a “way too early to know” category, but one thing traders should be aware of is that falling implied volatility can be a self-fulfilling prophecy on realized (actual) market volatility **The TLDR version is that it can load the market with gamma that may act as a governor on market moves as there are deltas to be bought lower and deltas to be sold higher.**

The **deeper dive** version is this. Following an extended period of High IV (like we just saw), a lot of options are bought at higher premium levels. In fact, if you had been buying options the past month and half, you were buying historically high IV, but you also happened to be buying options that were underpriced vs how the market was moving day to day and week to week.

Part of that movement in the markets can be attributed to a really loaded news cycle. We had inflation data, FOMC, Earnings, an election, and more. But all those buyers of calls and puts were also affecting actual market volatility as all that short gamma (residing with market makers and institutions that had sold those calls and puts) can supercharge moves in the market (and individual stocks).

Here’s an example. A $100 stock is about to report earnings, options are pricing about a 10% move. A lot of investors get worried about losing 10% overnight and go out to buy puts, especially piling into the 90 put. The company misses on earnings, the stock is lower by about 10% but there’s a lot of short gamma around that 90 line and market makers need to sell a bunch of stock lower to remain delta neutral. They push the stock even lower, below the strike, and beyond the move the market was expecting. That causes a chain reaction among longs in the stock who start to panic because they don’t know how low the stock can go. That selling pushes the stock even lower, creating even more long deltas that market makers need to sell, etc etc.

Now let’s look at the flipside. Following an extended period of time with the VIX near 30, it is now in the low 20’s. Since IV just spent so much time historically high for so long, the average cost that someone has bought options over the past few months is quite high. They are clearly now selling those options, as they don’t want to be stuck holding a bunch of options at super high IV (they don’t even need to think of it that sophisticatedly, they just see that their options lose value each day and want out). So as they sell those options. And the market makers who are short IV near 30 are happy to buy it back near 20. That’s how they make a significant portion of their money. However, a 23 VIX isnt even that low, it just seems low compared to where we just were. 19 is actually the historical mean, and the VIX has been known to get as low as the low teens.

So market makers buy to close the options they sold higher, and the short gamma, which had been acting as a market accelerant, is gone. That effect could have begun last week, no one knows yet though. The interesting part is what comes next. This is a shortened holiday week, and another few holiday weeks are coming next month. The world will be watching the World Cup, there seems to be a consensus about the FOMC’s next move, and sellers may be a bit exhausted. If option selling continues the next few weeks, and market makers begin to get loaded up with options, not only will the short gamma be gone from the market, but it will have gamma working not as an accelerant, but a governor, with market makers buying the dip, and selling the rip. And IV would go even lower.

Options are now just pricing about a 5% move into year-end. They were pricing 3%+ weekly moves recently.

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 5.9% last week and has now bounced about 12% from the 2022 lows (made in mid October.) It is about 17% away from its all-time closing highs (Dec ’21).

The big move higher last week came after a tamer-than-expected CPI print that has market participants thinking the Fed is now done with its 75 basis point hikes.

The 5.9% was obviously alot more than the 2.6% move options were pricing. But once again, because the move was to the upside, combined with most of the big cap earnings, the election, the FOMC decision, and CPI now behind us, vol continues to move lower. The VIX is now 22.5. Down from 34 in October. That declining vol has not been a reaction to options overpricing moves over the past month. In fact, the opposite has been true. What it is a sign of is worries of a crash, or continued move lower in the market, whether it be FOMC, Earnings, Election, or inflation data-driven, is now less of a likelihood in the near term. In fact, IV is now lower near-term, than it is out a few months, as seen by this 1 year SPY chart showing expected move levels and IV:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2mg7bcudquz91.gif

Bottom line, with the IV crush that accompanied the market rip higher last week, options are not pricing in a retest of those recent lows anytime soon. (In fact, options aren’t pricing those lows or the near-term (August) high until late Winter.)

And IV, which is about 19 near term in SPY, increases as you go out expiries, with options out in March around 23 IV.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.0% move for the upcoming week or about $8 in either direction. That is down from a 2.6% ($10) move options were pricing last week (actual move \^$22).

Speaking of that $22 move higher, from last week’s post:

>With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher.

Last week didn’t just see a Powerball winner, it also saw some of those lotto ticket upside calls win as well. Perhaps some of it was positioning for the chance of a CPI induced squeeze.

The economic calendar this week sees Retail Sales (as well as several big retail earnings) here in the US. This could be a scenario where hot numbers would be bad for the market because of inflation implications.

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 3.3% last week, erasing most of the gains made the week before. The majority of the move lower came immediately after a slightly more hawkish-than-expected press conference from Jay Powell following the FOMC rate change and statement. The market rallied on Friday and kept last week’s selloff from being even worse.

The 3.3% move lower was more than the 2.5% move options were pricing. The market has been moving more than options were pricing fairly consistently over the past month. Despite that, vol continued to trend lower, with many of the big earnings reports, plus the FOMC decision now out of the way. However, the election looms this week and that could keep a bid on options for the next few days. 30 day IV in SPY is about 24, with realized vol (actually moves) over the past month around 27. (for reference, realized vol for the past year is around 23, so 27 the past month means the market is volatile, even for 2022)

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of about $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 25. Its lowest levels since mid-September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher. The reasons why are numerous and unimportant is some ways, but from a trading perspective, it means that debit call spreads that buy ATM and sell upside strikes are more favorable than they have been in recent weeks (not to mention they are lower IV overall).

The economic calendar this week has an important CPI number, and of course, the mid-term elections are on Tuesday, with reactions beginning with Wednesday’s session.

**Last Week –** SPY rose 3.9% last week, despite disappointing earnings (and gaps lower) in big cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, (Apple’s 7.5% move higher, bucked the trend and helped close the week on a high note). That SPY move higher followed a 5% rally the week before. It is now about 10% above the recent lows. QQQ was up about 2.2% on the week, underperforming the broader market and weighed down by those earnings reports. QQQ is now about 8% higher than its recent lows. The Dow is about 14% higher.

Volatility fell across the board, with the VIX now below 26, both because of the move higher but also with a huge percentage of the SPX market cap now having reported.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 26, its lowest levels since mid September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

The economic calendar this week features both the FOMC, where a 0.75 rate increase is expected, and the NFP jobs number to round out the week.

**Last Week –** SPY rose 3.9% last week, despite disappointing earnings (and gaps lower) in big cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, (Apple’s 7.5% move higher, bucked the trend and helped close the week on a high note). That SPY move higher followed a 5% rally the week before. It is now about 10% above the recent lows. QQQ was up about 2.2% on the week, underperforming the broader market and weighed down by those earnings reports. QQQ is now about 8% higher than its recent lows. The Dow is about 14% higher.

Volatility fell across the board, with the VIX now below 26, both because of the move higher but also with a huge percentage of the SPX market cap now having reported.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 26, its lowest levels since mid September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

The economic calendar this week features both the FOMC, where a 0.75 rate increase is expected, and the NFP jobs number to round out the week.

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 1.5% in a wildly volatile week. Stocks saw a large two-day relief rally to begin the week as treasury yields declined, and hopes rose that the Fed was beginning to see evidence that would allow them to slow their aggressive rate hikes. Those hopes were dashed on Friday as the NFP report came in hot. Those numbers are notoriously backward-looking and even if it was the last hot payrolls report, markets seem to decide, that the Fed has cover for continued aggressive rate hikes for the foreseeable future.

The move on the week was inside what options were pricing but the swings in either direction during the week were way outside.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing about a 2.9% move for the upcoming week. The VIX ended last week around 31 and implied vol remains near its highs of the year.

## Earnings Season in High Vol

This week marks the beginning of earnings season, with a lot of eyes on the large banks that report towards the end of the week. Earnings season in a high vol environment means that options need to price both the earnings event itself but also the potential for large market moves into and out of the event.

That means trading the event itself needs to be fairly precise, with strategies placed just before and taken off just after in order to isolate the event itself. Here’s an example, with Wells Fargo (WFC) options pricing in a 5.2% expected move for the week ([Options AI free tool link](https://tools.optionsai.com/companies/WFC)).

To put that into some very recent perspective. WFC closed last week up nearly 4% and at one point during the week was higher by nearly 8%. The other banks reporting this week are also pricing around 5% moves, more on that below:

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 1.5% in a wildly volatile week. Stocks saw a large two-day relief rally to begin the week as treasury yields declined, and hopes rose that the Fed was beginning to see evidence that would allow them to slow their aggressive rate hikes. Those hopes were dashed on Friday as the NFP report came in hot. Those numbers are notoriously backward-looking and even if it was the last hot payrolls report, markets seem to decide, that the Fed has cover for continued aggressive rate hikes for the foreseeable future.

The move on the week was inside what options were pricing but the swings in either direction during the week were way outside.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing about a 2.9% move for the upcoming week. The VIX ended last week around 31 and implied vol remains near its highs of the year.

## Earnings Season in High Vol

This week marks the beginning of earnings season, with a lot of eyes on the large banks that report towards the end of the week. Earnings season in a high vol environment means that options need to price both the earnings event itself but also the potential for large market moves into and out of the event.

That means trading the event itself needs to be fairly precise, with strategies placed just before and taken off just after in order to isolate the event itself. Here’s an example, with Wells Fargo (WFC) options pricing in a 5.2% expected move for the week ([Options AI free tool link](https://tools.optionsai.com/companies/WFC)).

To put that into some very recent perspective. WFC closed last week up nearly 4% and at one point during the week was higher by nearly 8%. The other banks reporting this week are also pricing around 5% moves, more on that below:

xz6yvd_SPY,SPY,"Has the stock market (SPY down -24%, QQQ down -34%) even priced anything in yet?","The Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates higher and higher and is seeming to not have very much effect in the economy (as of now).  The only thing that seems to feel the pinch of higher interest rates is less home buying and less auto purchases.

Aside from that, inflation has barely budged, unemployment is back at historic lows at 3.5%, and inflation is still very high.

It doesn't seem like businesses (stocks) have said announced negative effects from higher interest rates, is this mostly true overall?

Is the stock market really down -24% prior to any real effect from higher interest rates entering the economy or is there another reason?

It seems like a 2 part process.  The fear of all these rate hikes scaring the market.  Then the rate hikes finally showing real economic effects on businesses that inevitably bring the stock market another leg lower?

## In the News

Last week I looked at how high vol was in the FAANG+ names and detailed some Iron Condors in Amazon. AMZN stock closed last week about where it ended the week before, however, overall market IV was higher. So a scorecard on high IV neutral trades would look like this so far. Stock not moving: yes, IV going lower: no.

Most of these names begin to report in late October with some reporting before Oct 21st expiry, like TSLA, and others after, like AMZN and GOOGL. With that in mind, and with IV even higher let’s look at another high IV strategy for those that may be looking to turn bullish in a stock. We’ll use GOOGL, as an example, using Oct 21st expiry, as earnings don’t come into play until the week after. And we’ll compare two credit put spreads, one at the money, the other out of the money:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lj9t0zoejer91.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe2ac758c23c94bad4a83411afa6174485e531c

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sqs7itrfjer91.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=da22cbc31d24db489f667c11d13290ed83f5482b

The first put spread sells the at the money put and buys the expected move put, risking 3, to make 2, if GOOGL is above $94 on Oct 21st. With the way stocks are whipping around this type of trade can be thought of as a fairly straightforward bullish play, with a little but of wiggle room below where the stock is trading (but not much). The more important factor is with IV this high, this trade doesn’t need a big snapback rally. It just needs a small one, or even one that starts from lower and just gets back to this point in the stock. In other words it doesn’t necessarily need to have its timing exactly right, nor its magnitude of move exactly right. Playing for a reversal with calls or debit call spreads kind of needs to have those things perfect at this point, with IV so high.

The second trade is an out-of-the-money put spread, risking about 75 to make 25 with its strikes set at the expected move. This is the type of trade someone does when they just think IV is beginning to overprice downside risk, and often at levels where they’d psychologically be a buyer of the stock. The advantage with a credit put spread vs a cash-secured put is that if the market crashes, it’s just a $75 loss rather than unlimited risk below.

GOOGL is simply an example here. There are a ton of similar stocks with similarly high IV at the moment. Eventually, there will be a snapback rally where calls work, but until then it’s interesting to look at some credit spreads and the defined risk associated with selling moves rather than trying to time them for a reversal.

Today I was able to get a quick trade off in the morning that netted me a profit of $159, I was risking $130 on this trade because of the volatility of late. My plan on this trade was that we reclaim the support zone that was broken Friday. This level once reclaimed also lined up with the 9ema on the 15 min chart. I bought calls on the wick down and sold into new highs of the day (annotated on chart above). My thesis on most trades that I buy off a moving average are that we are likely to create new highs on the day. I was a bit hesitant because since the lows of Friday, we have had nonstop green 15 min candles, so I knew that the trade was a little riskier because a pullback was likely today because of not having a single red 15min candle prior to this. All in all, I have been scalping a little more of late than I really planned, as I want to go back to holding for bigger moves, but its hard to change something that isn't broken. For example, if I would have held for the bigger move today (sell into gap close) I would have stopped out for a loss.

xf5cad_SPY,SPY,SPY vs SCHD.... What am I missing?,"Hello all,

I recently have began investing my money (22M) and was excited about dividends and specifically dividends in this macroeconomic environment. It seems intuitive to me that dividend stocks outperform the market when the market is flat or negative. According to my (extremely brief) research, however, this doesn't seem to be the case. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/sMRw7q9) is daily, dividend adjusted, returns of SCHD vs SPY vs SPHD. 

I pulled these numbers from capiq and don't know how to share an excel file, but it seems clear that spy outperforms schd even after taking dividends into account. Why not just buy the market and sell bits of your investment off as needed? I am not attacking anyone here just am genuinely curious why one would invest in schd if it just objectively underperforms spy.

Funny enough I actually have equal parts schd and spy in my portfolio right now, I am just trying to figure out what the argument for dividend etfs and specifically schd is. Are there tax benefits I am unaware of? Am I looking at the data the wrong way? Let's discuss in the comments!",2022-09-15,19,39

**Last Week –** The SPY rallied 3.6% last week, more than making up for the prior week’s 3.1% decline. Options were only pricing a 2% move, so that’s several weeks in a row where options have been underpricing market moves.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing a 2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** After 2 weeks near 26, the VIX declined to close last week, under 23.

## In the News

Last we checked in on Tesla (TSLA) in this space was with the stock heading into its 3-for-1 stock split. At the time the stock was about $295 split-adjusted and options were pricing an expected move was about 11% for the next month and a year-end expected move of about 25%. The stock did indeed move lower by about 11% but has now rallied right back, essentially now unchanged since its split and near $300.

As we’ve mentioned numerous times, TSLA stock has tended to make quick moves that far outpace option pricing, both higher and lower in the stock, over the past year. But splits can sometimes affect a stock’s volatility. Since the split, TSLA stock moves have been fairly muted, albeit with a very small sample set. Here’s the pricing going forward, with the options market pricing about a 10% move for the next month, and about a 20% move into year-end:

## In the News

The big news last week was the Powell-triggered sell-off on Friday. Markets had a bad reaction immediately and then got worse all day.

The selling caught options off guard. The VIX was below 20 in mid-August, something we hadn’t seen since April. Back in April a sub-20 VIX preceded a market sell-off that took the VIX above 34. Another IV spike above 34 in June marked the lows of the year in the SPY and preceded the recent rally.

The VIX closed below 26 on Friday, still below the middle of this year’s range. SPY options are pricing a weekly move near 2%, while in prior selloffs this year SPY options were regularly pricing moves of more than 3%. In other words, selling IV at these levels is positioning that Friday’s selloff won’t continue. While buying IV at these levels is positioning that the market is headed back towards the yearly lows.

For its part, the SPY is now roughly 15% off its highs, and 10% from its low on the year. SPY options are pricing about 10% move in either direction for the rest of 2022:

## In the News

The big news last week was the Powell-triggered sell-off on Friday. Markets had a bad reaction immediately and then got worse all day.

The selling caught options off guard. The VIX was below 20 in mid-August, something we hadn’t seen since April. Back in April a sub-20 VIX preceded a market sell-off that took the VIX above 34. Another IV spike above 34 in June marked the lows of the year in the SPY and preceded the recent rally.

The VIX closed below 26 on Friday, still below the middle of this year’s range. SPY options are pricing a weekly move near 2%, while in prior selloffs this year SPY options were regularly pricing moves of more than 3%. In other words, selling IV at these levels is positioning that Friday’s selloff won’t continue. While buying IV at these levels is positioning that the market is headed back towards the yearly lows.

For its part, the SPY is now roughly 15% off its highs, and 10% from its low on the year. SPY options are pricing about 10% move in either direction for the rest of 2022:

wxommn_BP,BP,8-25-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis,"The classic pump, dump, pump, fake dump then pump it to the moon. I gotta say that is one of the biggest pumps during a power hour that we have seen in a very long time. SPX 0dte contracts bought before power hour woulda been a solid 1000% gain… I cant even tell you the last time that has happened. 

https://preview.redd.it/27z0wub56xj91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=327230562a39aa223c570197733356bbbc2a25f1

A lot going on here now on the daily and we finally got some direction! 

SPY this morning tested the daily 8ema and daily 200ema, however, were smacked down to almost the lows of days. The bulls managed to regather all their strength and popped it not only through key level of 417.5 but they also popped it straight through and closed a candle over the daily 8ema and daily 200ema. 

This is a heavily favored bull chart right now. I had mentioned I took an L on my 418c (Friday dte) calls yesterday and it now appears I was about one day too early on those calls. This movement is what I was actually anticipating to happen yesterday. 

Now that we have closed over the daily 8ema, 200 ema and over key 417.5 resistance we should favor upside here. I mentioned last week (and got a lot of flak for it) that I did not go long put 30-60dte puts yet because I had a thesis where we would retest near 430 before we saw the sell off. Well that thesis looks to becoming true right now. 

With this fairly bullish close we should look for the 421.22 gap fill tomorrow and IF ole daddy JPOW can whisper the right sweet nothings to the markets we just might even see 430 tomorrow… 

Key support- 

417.5 is the line in the sand. If we tomorrow lose 417.5 and close under it then it is time to go short and this should be seen as a failed breakout attempt. From 416.7 breaks the recovery support line. 

Key resistance-

418.8 (blue downward channel) -> 420 -> 422 (gap fill at 421.22) -> 424.8 -> 426 -> 427.9 -> 429.4 (bear market resistance line… 2.3% day)

Futures support-

4183 -> 4175 (breaks recovery support) -> 4156

Futures resistance-

4210 -> 4223 (downward resistance) -> 4232 -> 4256

https://preview.redd.it/88mf5a076xj91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a692ff17fe43b917b4c978bd113289ef998f9f0c

Being that Apple broke through its resistance line of the downward channel (the same ones spy and futures are just below) I suspect we see a green day tomorrow across the board and we should see Apple fill its upper gap. 

Support-

170 (recovery support line) -> 168.8 -> 167.5 -> 166.4

Resistance-

171.6 (gap fill at 171.31) -> 173 -> 174.6

https://preview.redd.it/ea0tinm76xj91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=191aad16c61268905f2ed1bab336ddcc5652b202

The VIX broke its recovery support line today and therefore we should look for a bullish day for markets tomorrow while it completes its gap fill at 21.27 and potentially retests 19.7 support area. 

Where are we at then? What should we expect tomorrow? 

Well tomorrow morning we have PCE releasing which will be interesting as that is something that JPOW specifically mentioned was important and even more important then CPI. 

From there at 10am JPOW starts to talk about at the Jackson Hole. This is pretty much what my expectations are for tomorrow. 

If we look at the past times JPOW has spoken whether it be random meetings like this, any time he has testified, and even FOMC meetings/ minutes. What is the one common theme? Markets rally like no other. There has been times where JPOW is testifying for two days and the markets go on a bull binger for two days straight and then the third day once he is finally done speaking markets dump. 

This is my intentions and this is my thoughts on whats going to happen tomorrow and how I would like to play tomorrow. 

I am sitting cash gang overnight. I will check market sentiment in the morning and as long as we aren’t in some massive red open and massive sell off before 10am then I will most likely look to enter some calls to let ride for the day. Overall if this is going to do what I suspect it is going to do then we should see low volume over all (due to no sellers) and from there we should see SPY ride the 5ema/ 8ema on the 15min chart and not break it… that’s how we know we are in a big trend day up. From there the key timeframe bulls have to survive with the trend through is 11am. 

I will try to if the trend holds ride calls all day long and then I will save some BP and I will look to open some 30 dte puts. My expectations are that we do retest bear market resistance and that we do see a retest of 425-430. The only reason I would NOT open 30 dte puts tomorrow is if 1. I run outta BP making trades (profits over speculation always) or 2. SPY breaks and closes over 430. 

10% challenge-

Its just been one of those weeks for me. Thankfully working with a green day and green week despite some rookie mistakes and TOS not filling two of my wins earlier this week. Patience remains key in this market and fast profits. Despite some of these huge moves we are having we are still having high volatility and trends that break the technicals.

Curious as to what you would invest in today. I would like to continue building a portfolio of SPY, but considering I’m 20, I was thinking about buying a decent amount of QQQ first, then buying SPY after I have a decent amount of QQQ.  

My biggest worry is that I could still lose decent amounts of money. If I invested in QQQ in 2000, my investment in SPY would be worth more from DOT.com bubble. 

Does anyone feel QQQ is overvalued for P/E ratios?

w5m593_BP,BP,7-22-22 SPY/ ES Futures Weekly TA and Recap (bonus Apple today)… this is along one but worth it…,"This week was an interesting one. The bulls were pretty clearly in control all week yet we only secured a 2.5% green week. The most interesting thing though is that this is the first week before FOMC that has been green since 2021… Almost every week before FOMC has been very red (average is -2 to -5%). 

Speaking of FOMC week (recommend you read my TA I just posted on that too… ) but two of the last four FOMC Mondays/ Tuesdays were red (averaging -1.2% for the reds Mondays/ Tuesday) and averaging +0.6% for the green Mondays/ tuesdays). It should be noted that the reddest Monday/ Tuesday before FOMC was this last meeting in June where we dropped a total of 4.2% over two days. 

Lets start with SPY then move onto ES as this week we are actually seeing some differences that present two different cases for next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/ttb64ej0v6d91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=de373690d4f202db1944d1e6032744ca994a836b

The chart actually has quite a few things to keep an eye on.

Rising wedge- Today you see the rising wedges support line was broken. Technically it was broken yesterday but because we still had a green day it was worth noting a possible new support could have built. Plus the support for this rising wedge on the 15minute had not been broken yet. Now that we have broken this support it should be assumed a retracement back down is coming as this is a bearish reversal pattern. 

Double top- We actually put in a perfect double top on the daily today with resistance now being at 398.9. This should be seen as a major resistance going forward. This level has been hit time and time again. 

401.44 Gap- today we chipped away at the 401.55 gap dropping it from a $2.6 gap to a $1.29 gap. There is actually a case to be made though that SPY is going to build support here and consolidate sideways (much like we did in April and June) before we either fall more or make our next move up. While my personal preference is not that SPY fills this gap Monday there is a case to be made that we could pop $6.5 fill it really quick and then start our sell off. Would be a nice 1.6% pop on Monday. I suppose the case could be made that we fill it and consolidate here before FOMC Wednesday instead of seeing a true sell off. 

378.57 to 380.54 gap- we still have this about $3 gap left down below and I would be very surprised to not see it filled this week. Overall I actually suspect this to be filled by Tuesday EOD its about a 4.5% drop from here. At minimum if they really are planning to leave this unfilled I suspect them to cut that gap in half. 

369.38 to 370.18 gap- this 80 cent gap still exists and lives rent free in SPYs head… overall this one being under $1 while statistically speaking it SHOULD fill I would not be surprised if this one did not fill.

Symmetrical triangle- looking at this daily you can see we have a symmetrical triangle forming with the green dotted being resistance and the blue dotted being support. WE should look to see now that resistance has been made a dip back to retest support. 

Daily 50ema- this was the first week that SPY has broken above the daily 50ema since April. Despite trading beneath it today and threatening to close below it today the bulls bounced it enough to close above it… I like to say when an EMA is broken like this that it is a hint of what to come. Had this been true support I would have liked to seen a bounce off of it and not trade beneath it the way we did. My suspicion is that we see this broke and we test the daily 8 and 20ema this week ahead. 

https://preview.redd.it/qzleloz1v6d91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ba4784afb62f670e8fe3acd2a63ab4fd34d768

The weekly chart I would call bullish but weak. Today we saw that 400 level retested and a pretty solid resistance rejection as you can see. After that 400 test we saw a pretty violent sell off and rejection further down. This is the first time the weekly candle has closed above the weekly 8ema since the week of April 5th. 

Overall you can see we have actually started a very mild bull channel upwards. The support for that next week that is crucial to hold is 389.4. 

Bull and bear wise for SPY… I see far more reason to be bearish then I do bullish right now. I would be vey surprised to see the markets not begin to panic at all before FOMC. To go into FOMC bullish or even neutral with no sell off would be hella surprising. The only case I can have be made for that is that everyone expects 75bps hike and now that big tech is laying people off they are going to look to see if the feds actually pause rate hikes after this one. That or we truly are setting up for one hell of a bloody week with big tech earnings, FOMC and GDP Thursday. 

Bulls-

Bulls are going to want to see this 395 support level hold on Monday and from there they have a lot of resistance to break through to fill the gap before FOMC and try to be in the 400s before FOMC on Wednesday. 

389.9 -> 401.4 (gap fill and break resistance line) -> 405.4 -> 409.5 -> 412

Bears-

Bears are going to want to break down that 395 support and break through the daily 50ema without question. Once the daily 50ema is closed under they will look to drop this back under the daily 8 and 20ema and prevent the 8ema from crossing above the 50ema. 

395 -> 392.3 -> 388.7 -> 385.3 -> 382.1 -> 378.8 (gap fill) -> 376.8 (support line)

ES futures daily chart is a little different. 

As you can see the bulls actually held it above the rising wedges support when they prevented the end of day sell off. The wedge is pretty much reached its peak right now though and we are about as close to a decision without having it as we can possible be. So lets talk about the daily ES.

Rising wedge- this morning when we broke out to 4016 we actually DID break the resistance line of the rising wedge. It was not by much but it did very slightly wick through resistance. However, due to the immediate rejection we could have had a fake breakout. This pattern will play out Monday with either 3978 support breaking or 4005 resistance breaking. Being that 4005 has been a key resistance I would be surprised to see a breakout to the upside

Symmetrical triangle- this uses the blue dotted support and red dotted resistance line. As I had mentioned the red dotted resistance was broken but its possible it’s a fake breakout. If we start breaking down this week we will look for support between 3775 and 3790 on the blue dotted line depending on the intensity of the drop. If we were to see the rising wedge hold and see the red dotted line broken at 4005 then we are actually going to be targeting 4100-4175 next week. 

Daily 50ema- much like SPY I mentioned about they closed it over the 50ema today just barely at the end. Bears will want to break that down next week while bulls defend it again. 

https://preview.redd.it/g42k32s3v6d91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9697171d1040b6cb594355b1f281fb310ef39b

Now the futures weekly is looking similar to SPY but almost more bullish to me. We are seeing that we closed above that key 3905 resistance line. That has been a magnet for the last 4 weeks and we finally were able to close away from it. 

As you can see we have that blue dotted mild bull channel formed here too. We will keep a close eye on that this week and weeks to come. I am seeing that SPY weekly did fail to break out above the 100ema despite having the bullish close over the weekly 8ema for first time since the week of March 28th. 

When I look at the ES daily/ weekly chart I actually want to be more bullish than I do with SPY. It actually attempted to break out upwards from resistance of the symmetrical triangle before being smacked down. In addition I have been saying I truly think the bottom is in and if the bottom is truly in then this slow mild bull channel would be the perfect mild recovery trajectory. 

There is no doubt who was in control this week and that was the bulls. Even the VIX on this pretty good sell off SPY had managed to close at 23. The VIX made a lower low despite a pretty big red day for SPY. 

If I was looking at this chart right here and I didn’t have FOMC to worry about and didn’t have earnings to worry about I would be saying lets load some calls for next week cause shes finna rip and that this dip was the buying opportunity. However, we have to even in a macro trend look at the micro trend. 

I wont lie when I started writing this TA I was full bear for next week. But the more I look really hard into things, adjust things for how the day finished out im struggling not feeling bullish next week. Had the bears been able to break us down close to 392/ 3920 or below EOD then I would be hella bearish but im slightly struggling being bearish more then knowing FOMC usually is a drop in market due to fear. 

I still do see now looking at this a case for that gap fill Monday or Tuesday. But the unknown of course is going to be FOMC… is markets truly already numb and priced in the 75bps hike and we are just going to rally or at least range into FOMC? I mean I suppose its possible. 

I recommend you read my FOMC dd/ta I posted but I mention playing calls in there at 235pm and being careful of a January FOMC when we dump… if market is truly going to go into FOMC with a bullish mentality that everything is fine and we have nothing to worry about then we do need to be very careful with what we do on that FOMC trade. IF we get truly something in left field and JPOW is even slightly hawkish we are about to see the mega dumps of mega dumps. I also think with GDP the next day we are going to aggressive dump Thursday.

Now apple is an interesting chart. I missed the massive breakout that apple was going on and truly that handicapped me this week as I missed the bullish tech momentum that Apple hinted at in early July. 

Rising wedge- apple is trading within two potential rising wedges. There is the solid black support line which puts support close to 150.5 to 152. This support has held up nicely since June 30th that’s nearly a month long bull support line on Apple. Resistance wise we have the first one using todays candle the black dotted which shows 156.5 as resistance for Monday and then we have the solid black resistance line that actually shows Apple could break out of its grey bear channel. 

Grey bear channel- this channel resistance has not been tested since the April bull run. We are closer to it now then we have been since then. This week we have potential to not only test resistance but also to break resistance if Apple can see 158. 159.5 for 100% confirmation. However, a rejection here would play the bearish thesis out for SPY and the overall markets. This 158 rejection also would allow SPY to fill its 401.5 gap. 

Daily 200ema- this is the first time we have seen Apple close a full candle over the 200ema since May 4th (ironically that was FOMC day). 

Daily double top- apple put in a pretty convincing double top at 155.5 today and that will prove to be a key level for bulls to retake and for bears to defend. 

EMAs- we now have the daily 20ema crossed over the 50ema for the first time since April 22nd (very bullish), and we have the daily 8 ema threatening to cross over the 100ema which would be an incredibly bullish move. Bulls need to defend that 200ema with their lives next week. 

Earnings- this is actually why I am currently in a 7dte 152.5P for next week. In April the 7day proceeding earnings on the 28th saw a 10% drop and 9% drop. With the big SNAP miss and overall slowing of hiring announced this week and what not I am playing this that we should see further drop Monday Tuesday and Wednesday leading to the Thursday Earnings. This would target 138-140. I personally do not think it dips that low but I am eyeing support around 147. 

&#x200B;

The Apple weekly chart actually is looking hella bullish right now. 

Black dotted bull channel- that we have held despite its tightness for 6 weeks now… That’s some significant movement green… Support for this remains at 152.3 next week. IF that level breaks we should suspect downside closer to 140-145. If bulls defend 152.3 we have upside potential of 167 based on the black dotted channel. 

Red dotted bear channel- this channel shows that if bulls hold onto support of the black bull channel and if earnings are good this week we could be seeing 164 tested. This 164 and red dotted resistance line is very important because it shows that we are 100% out of the bear channels and will look to tackle the last resistance line at 175. The thing to know is that Apple unlike most charts (SPY/ QQQ) didn’t have the straight drop it sideways burned and in March had such an aggressive recovery it nearly retouched ATHs. 

Blue dotted bear channel- this one is a key level for bulls to break through. It rides at 156.2 which is the level Apples weekly rejected at this week. If we break through that there is a lot of green ahead of us. If we reject there and reconfirm the bear channel then we are starting to think about that support line down in the low 100s again. 

Overall I see a big case for bulls the more im diving into this. If it was not for FOMC I would be 100% bullish next week. Is FOMC enough reason to not be bullish though? Historically speaking yes it is. As you can see every week this year before FOMC has been red in preparation and 50% of the time SPY is red the two days before FOMC. Once we get FOMC, GDP and Earnings outta the way then we can follow the chart and not the events. 

NOTE- I am out of town Monday and Tuesday with the family at the beach… no TA those days and no trading those days. I will be back in the saddle Wednesday though for FOMC of course!

10% challenge-

Overall this was a red week for me. I had a great Monday (broke my 5 week long red Monday streak which is great… also broke my red Friday streak too) but I unfortunately could not get on board with the bull thesis this week and that was my downfall. I was too bearish with FOMC coming up and expecting a sell off that I missed out on big gains. That was a bias I gave myself based on previous data. 

I also got greedy at times too and didn’t trust the trend. This is actually the best trends I have seen in months on SPY. We pretty much had five days this week that once the morning bullshit was done we were locked into a solid trend that was easy to follow and maximum gains were able to be achieved. OF course this market has turned most of us into scalpers so its hard to trust anything over 10-15% gains. 

This week ALMOST makes me believe in trusting the trend. And that just because a candle retraces slightly doesn’t mean we have to exit. If this is truly the new market and we truly put a bottom in… we just might be seeing some normalcy return. 

The biggest thing for me next week is to not fight the trend and also no matter what I THINK its going to do we trust the trend in front of us. I wont miss out on any rallies just because I don’t believe it anymore.

I didn’t make any new trades today. I averaged down my 0dte that I swung (too early but still for nice profit) and then I let my 5dte run till pretty much the bottom at 393 and close that for maximum profits. Overall a great day. I didn’t make any actual day trades just cause I didn’t wanna be over leveraged and I was planning to save BP for a swing but decided not to use what I planned to use.

I opened this VERY small swing for next weeks earnings. I expect a sell off into earnings so I will be looking to close this Monday or Tuesday depending on what happens. However, upon writing this TA I am not as confident in this position as I was when I opened it and Apple and SPY looked like an EOD sell off was coming. 

I don’t plan to trade at all Monday or Tuesday. I might make a small swing Monday night depending on what I see. But Tuesday night historically besides the January FOMC the risk to reward of swinging anything into FOMC is not there…",2022-07-22,16,3

Spy

The Long Play

\- There are two options for the long play tomorrow, depending on where we open and how volume and price is reacting will be the overall factor if I take either. 

The 1st is we break the 396.50 level and confirm. If this happens I will plan for 401.50 for a sell target

The 2nd is we retest the lows of the box we traded in today (392.90) and get bought back up on some bullish volume, I will plan to sell into the top of the range if this happens (396)

&#x200B;

The Short Play

\- We stay trading in today's box of 396 to 393, if price action and volume is setting up at the top of the range, I will be expecting a pull back to the bottom where I will be covering.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

AMD

The Long Play

\- We hold and confirm over 89.40s and have room up to 94.75 for a gap close as the big target, the soft target would be 92 as this also a very key level (the opposing side of the gap). This setup looks very similar to how spy looked coming into today.

&#x200B;

Side Note:

These moves are what I see as possibilities not absolutes, I am not just buying calls blindly expecting things to go my way, these are my key levels where I want price action/volume to confirm for me to take the trade. Always respect your risk because no one has a crystal ball that can tell them every move that is going to happen, that is why we take high RR trades so you don't have to worry about always being right.",2022-07-21,9,9

What the actual fuck is going on around here? But to be fair it makes sense…. It makes sense that they would do it on a random ass day instead of when we all expected it and were all positioned for it. 

Now the question is…. Was this a over reaction or was this the beginning of the next big leg down? My vote? I think we bounce tomorrow and maybe once tesla reports we actually go down… That’s my opinion… Ta wise it could go either way.

If you look at SPY and ES futures weekly chart you can see we broke out upwards from the descending wedge which should be bullish, however, they both perfectly rejected their weekly 8ema. That rejection is actually more bearish than the resistance line break out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ts7pfdewzdc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aebba8a453ff6adbab57c2558e35753c9a0692e

Now the daily charts for SPY and Es futures look pretty bearish to me. On SPY we see we nearly perfectly tapped the downward tan channels resistance line and came just short of the sideways purple resistance line too. This tells me we have more to go down. If you look at the next chart below you can see we had a similar movement on April 21st and similar sized candle red on that day. We could be seeing the next big move of the market over the next month or so if this resistance rejection holds true. 

Looking at the ES futures you see that we broke the blue dotted resistance line which would be bullish but we rejected the purple channel. You can see by the blue arrows that everytime we have hit these we have reversed course. 

https://preview.redd.it/s3y0u5jxzdc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c70967916ddd099a0f8b6496a184814382856e

And then we have the vix… it attempted to break back into that key 25.5 level today and even saw 25.91 at its peak today but overall I would still venture to say that the VIX is not onboard yet for the next leg down. The only reason im not saying its time to go heavy into some puts here or uvxy/ VIX calls is because of how the VIX reacted today… I feel like it more naturally reacted today but it still didn’t quite spike and hold like we would have expected. I would and will be bearish longer term once we break through 26.7 VIX. 

I still think this could have easily been a market over reaction to the Apple news. If it was a over reaction then we will see a pop tomorrow and most likely see a green day tomorrow. Unless some more news about tech come out tomorrow there really isn’t anything until Tesla earnings Wednesday night that would really move the markets. I would be careful here.

&#x200B;

I also would be careful until this  breaks back under 20k. Hoping that a picture of it wont result in my post getting removed… but I think this being so green today is a big hint of whats to come. I wont be full bear thill this breaks back under 20k and holds. 

Bull case for SPY/ ES-

Despite the big sell off today we managed to close at that key 382 support. It is an adjusted close to just slightly under 382.23 which is the daily 8ema… Looking at Fridays candle we do see a possible double bottom forming here at 382 and the wicks at 380.6. The VIX has not fully committed to the next drop yet and until we really see that break and fly over 26.6 we most likely are going to hold what we got. We do have to keep in mind that today could have been a true market over reaction which we have seen time and time before. It could be argued that this new was used as a chance to fill the big gap up we had overnight and that now that the gap is filled we should reverse. 

Bear case for SPY/ ES- Markets have been looking for a reason to dump and this might finally be the reason. With a resistance line rejection of two key channels this morning with a failure to break through that is bearish. This morning even before the apple new markets had SPY pinned within a <$2 range for almost the whole day till the sell off started. After blowing through key 385 support and now closing under the daily 8ema and 382 support it is only natural that we could see 378.8 to fill the gap below us. We also have a fully engulfing bear candle on the daily now

Daily support for SPY- 382 -> 378.8 -> 375.1 -> 370.6

Daily support for ES- 3795 -> 3744 -> 3671

Daily resistance for SPY- 385 -> 387.3 -> 390.3

Daily resistance for ES- 3915 -> 4020

I feel bearish long term still but short term im not ready to be bearish enough to hold anything. I would have like it better had we stopped at 385 and formed a doji at the top on all the dailys to help with a clear reversal. This fat massive candle is not quite the reversal candle we would expect. The case for both channel resistance rejection is quite strong but we haven’t had back to back trend days in a very long time and all last week no matter what happened buyers ate everything up and we even saw that today. 

Overall I see two scenarios

1) We will hold support here at 382 and back test resistance at 385. A rejection at 385 would be a more compelling top/ reversal case than we have here. I also wouldn’t be surprised to see the 388.5 resistance retested tomorrow either. If we see that then we can get not only a TRUE double top on the daily but we can also get a true tan channel resistance rejection. That would be a case for me to feel and stay feeling bearish. 

2) If we are seeing the next leg down it will start with filling the gap at 378.8. This is going to be key with what happens next. Most times a gap fills we do see a reversal so that is something we would need to keep in mind. However, if the VIX finally gets on board or we get anymore big tech bad news we might see this sell off continue. I would need VIX >26.6 to believe in it though. 

https://preview.redd.it/mbsl48j00ec91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e88fe5b12e59784846a5243e5f37561d7337c7e

AMD actually looks fairly bearish here on the daily with this hanging man doji. This is the type of candle I wanted to see on ES or SPY today to really sell the top but we didn’t get it. AMD did fill their daily gap though so I would be surprised if we see a back test of support at 79.5. If that 79.5 support holds there is a pretty big case to be made for 87.2 still especially with the CHIP bill being voted on tomorrow. However, if 79.5 fails we just might see a back test of that 71.6 support. 

10% challenge-

Today was a GREAT day that I turned into a GOOD day thanks to greed and also playing it safe. All morning I hated the trend and I recognized the range super early which was great. The news broke out and I was able to get some nice plays in. I was not expecting this level of dump today and was definitely expecting this to be an over-reaction and recovery intraday especially since VIX wasn’t on board. Made some great gains and then at 2pm I made my error but going in on another 0dte OTM 381p. They burnt me with the choppiness and I finally decided to close for -41.7% after it bounced and bounce and bounced around. Little did I know had I just held on a little longer… it woulda been a 6x position by EOD. 

Days like today are the hardest because its the time of day that if you just hold on long enough everything will be green. But days like today make the next day even harder. Because then we have this false safe feeling that “well if I just hold them imma get green.” And then we just keep holding and averaging down and it just keeps getting redder and redder until we realize we are too burn to even salvage anything. In this market we have to salvage our losses and mitigate our risk/ loss. 

Todays biggest lesson was 0dtes are still a great trade but EOD OTM 0dte are a big struggle. Had I just gone ATM like I usually do I wouldn’t have gotten burnt like that and felt the need to sell. I will not be playing these OTM again until days like FOMC when we fully expect the big move before it happens. 

Also had I just sat with my $1200 profits I would have been very happy but instead I ended up with just over $600 in profits. Tough day to trade today for sure.

Spy

The Long Play

\- We break out and hold the prior resistance we created on Friday (384.85), and sell into the 388.42 level/gap.  At the end of Friday we tried for the break but the market closed, closing us over the resistance. Which is why I wont be surprised if we see a gap up on Monday as well.

The Short Play

\- We fail the breakout and break through support (383.35) with room to tank till 378.36, which is also a gap close to the downside.

TSLA

&#x200B;

Long Play

\- We break and hold 722.11, the major resistance level this past week on TSLA, and have room to run till 749, the prior support level, which will most likely become resistance on the way back up.

So lets get to a few market things first before I touch on charts. I saw a really interesting chart today that shows the UMICH consumer sentiment vs the Russel 1000 that shows they are severely diverted from eachother. 

What does this mean? Well this is the furtherest they have ever been from eachother in the last 30 years. There is still a lot of people out there that thinks despite how far the market has come down that there is still a very long way to go. I would have thought CPI woulda started the next leg down but that is not the case… lets get into that a little bit.

Yesterday the fed went from “we will not be doing a 100bps hike” to wow yeah man we really just might do a 100bps hike back today where now its down to a 17% chance of 100bps hike. The craziest thing about this all is if you look at the last CPI it jumped from 8.3% to 8.6% from April to May and JPOW shit himself and the markets did too with a massive 75bps hike that was not expected… now CPI is up 0.5% HIGHER than previous CPI (more than last time which was only 0.3%) and all of a sudden it doesn’t matter what we do rate hike wise and markets don’t care about 75 vs. 100bps hike? 

Confused? Me too… I touch on this a little below as to what I suspect is the true thing going on.

I mentioned on the CPI night that I think we are experiencing some psyops in the market… the media is fueling this rollercoaster and we are being led astray for now. It is even more evident by the VIX that the “fear” is being contained right now… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cm8xbwy4rsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=77fd1c81821105bd811c925838ca45f60d1ff845

The VIX daily chart is very telling of current sentiment and that is that nothings going to take us down. After spy had 4 days of red this week and closed out today green for this week SPY is only down $0.72 cents on the week. They were close to closing this week out as a green week. 

This is the lowest close on the VIX since June 8th. Interestingly enough June 8th was the top of the last trend before we crashed. Looking at the vix there is a case that we could see a bounce Monday around 23.9 on the VIX at that support level which would let SPY truly top before we start our next leg down. 

I am also now if we break through that 23.9 level under the impression that the markets are going to completely unwind the VIX down to 18-20 level before tesla earnings hit on Wednesday night. Tesla will be the first notable earnings that could move the markets and then the week after that is massive with MSFT, GOOG, APPLE, and META. Not only that but we also have FOMC on Wednesday the 27th and then GDP is on July 28th the next day. That GDP should confirm a recession. 

Many of you red my UVXY/ VIX calls post and I do believe I was correct. The one thing I am wondering is if I was wrong on the timing. I suspect markets to panic from CPI to FOMC like previously but I am wondering if markets are going to rally from CPI to FOMC and then once that week of earnings and FOMC and GDP happen markets then panic till the next CPI and FOMC. At this point I think watching for the VIX to hit 18-20 and UVXY to hit 11.5 again to go long on some 30-60dte calls is the way to go. This is the lowest close for UVXY since April 21st interestingly enough. UVXY also has not closed under 11.5 since January. So that will be a key level to watch for next week.

The one thing im really watching on the daily is the close of this candle. It is a hanging man LIKE candle but the wick is not long enough. So this could end up like a continuation candle similar to June 23rd instead of a reversal candle like May 17th.

Things to note here for a bull vs. bear case on daily and weekly chart. 

Bull case- despite a bearish catalyst week we managed to close it with a dragonfly doji. Despite all the craziness we saw this week we saw a bullish finish to the week. We got our weekly 372 channel support test/ bounce. On the daily we broke through the red dotted resistance line which means we made a high high. We also close above the daily 8ema AND the daily 20ema for the first time since last Friday.  

Bear case- on the weekly we saw a new lower low for the third week in a row and that was also followed by the third lower high too. While we did not confirm resistance there is a VERY large descending wedge forming on the weekly chart. We have enough of the triangle left that there is a case we see a rejection next week followed by a descent below. Despite the bullish close today one could assume the last three days of bullish volume came from OPEX and how much downward OI there was. We now have a daily gap of $1.54 on the daily (note- this gap is actually closer to $2 as the daily movement of SPY never actually hit $379.05 on Thursday despite what the candles say). While historically gaps always fill we still have a 402 gap above unfilled so that is not something you can say anymore. 

Daily supports to watch- 382 à 379 (gap fill) à 375 à 370 (channel support) 

Weekly supports to watch- 372 (channel support) à 364 (weekly 200ema)

Daily resistance to watch- 388 à 390 (downward channel support AND sideways channel support) à 393 à 398 à 402 (gap fill)

Weekly resistance to watch- 388 (ascending wedge resistance) à 413 (downward channel resistance)

What I am watching for is whether we are going to attempt to back fill this gap Monday or Tuesday or whether we are going to break through 390. 390 is a HUGE level for Monday. IF that level is broken then we are actually hella bullish. With no major earnings to really effect the market and no real economic data to effect it either till Thursday at open we just might see a hell of a ripper early next week.

ES daily actually looks a little different than SPYs. I mentioned yesterday that it looked like futures was turning bullish and it appears Thursday might be the temp bottom again. We did see a rejection of that blue dotted support line at 3867 EOD today though but it closed over the daily 8 AND 20 ema for the first time since July 8th (which ironically was top). 

I am watching on the daily for Mondays open if we see a red open and we hold resistance at 3850 we will most likely be headed for a back test of that key 3744 support. Sundays night open will be very very important to watch. Anything over 3850 Sunday is bullish for the week. 

Daily supports to watch- 3793 à 3744 à 3672 (channel support) 

Daily resistance to watch- 3850 à 3915 (channel support) à 4020

Futures weekly chart is probably the most bearish of anything I have talked about yet. So it will be curious to see which one plays out. 

The weekly chart actually confirmed the resistance of the descending triangle on Monday and closed with a true hanging man candle. This true hanging man candle has me suspect that we are going to see a retrace come Monday that takes us back down to that 3675 area. The futures charts are more skeptical and bearish then SPY itself. 

If we were to have a mega bull week next week we could see not only the descending wedge broken (any open over 3875 breaks it) we could see the overall downward channel and the overall sideways channel broken. It would take an impressive 7.7% move to do it but with the way the markets are running its not impossible. Or we could see a retest of that channel and rejection which could confirm further downside in two weeks for FOMC/ earnings/ GDP.

Weekly supports- 3830 à 3675

Weekly resistance- 3875 à 4136 à 4165

Overall SPY/ ES I would say I am bullish next week and will be looking to position to be bearish the following week.

AMD actually had a hell of a great day and week this week. AMD looks to on the daily have established a V shaped recovery at 71.6. My pre-market plan was to go long on AMD after it back tested 79.5 support and then go long with 7dte calls for next week looking for 87 range. I should have done it but I decided to wait. I am hesitant only that the markets are a little irrational right now. Most likely will regret that next week. 

Daily supports- 79.5 à 76.6 à 71.6

Daily resistance- 83.8 à 87

AMD weekly is in a nice descending wedge too. The weekly candle is a hanging man so that worries me but it should be able to push through if it keeps up the same momentum. Overall we are looking for 87 resistance to be tested next week and to hold that v shaped support line. If we break through 87… 95-98 is on the table for sure. But any retracement below 77 would be noted as bearish omen. 

10% challenge-

I had a great but boring day today. I did not like the open today as we dumped then ripped and had some wild candles. With the massively green open and UMICH sentiment I knew I was not going to go in until closer to 1030-11. By them we were already at the probable high of day IV wise and I was not going to play anything above that. My strategy is very strict about not going long/ short when SPY hits those levels. I also noticed that IV on SPY and AMD were hella high today and my mid day we got crushed. I watched 384.6 resistance hold all day long and EOD played a nice SPX (my first one) 0dte put scalp off the breakdown and then played a SPY 0dte call once biden was done talking and the volume came pumping in. Overall GREAT day and GREAT week. 

This is actually the highest weekly WIN RATE year to date for me. This week I was EXTRA patient and really waited for my plays and waited for the chart to come to me. It made all the difference.

I look forward to a good weekend to rest. I am sitting cash gang over the weekend. I was tempted to go long on SPY calls but decided to stick to what it old myself at the beginning of the month and do no swings. The biggest loss this week came from CPI day. It came from ANTICIPATING a play AND it came from trading while SPY was at the probable IV range. I did not stick to my guns that day and I did not let the chart come to me. I also double down on that loser which became 2x as big of a loser. Doubling down can work when tactfully done… but most of the time like I have said before don’t add to a loser to make it a bigger loser… I also took a loss on Monday due to TOS not filling my order completely which is a logistical issue I could not avoid and is part of the risk of 0dtes in the last 15minutes. 

Overall great week for me mentally and trading wise. Look forward to the weekend with the fam and seeing you guys back on Monday!",2022-07-15,28,9

Today after opening massively red we got… the money glitch day. So this has only happen one other time that I have ever seen (June 30th the JPM collar day) and that day I assumed it was just a glitch from that, however, there was a MASSIVE 1.6 billion Dark pool print at yesterday at the 379.05 level… Now look at the daily ranges below (there se were from around 11am the same time I saw this last month). From here I assumed we were going to rally all day and break the IV probable high and we sure did. Great day for everyone who played the calls on the server. I took profits way early but I only trust things so much in this make belief market…

Looking at SPY daily chart I have to say I am pretty bullish here. We finally touched the support area of 370 (371.04 to be exact) and now with the VIX refusing to rise anymore and unwinding I am looking to see SPY hit 388 next week and test this channel resistance. It could on a big enough day do it tomorrow but that seems unlikely. 

https://preview.redd.it/uryf8k9ielb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5e2ecf2e2cb9d35afc957608b33d2d94396f598

This massive dragonfly doji is even more bullish on the ES futures daily chart. 

Bull case- I am looking for ES futures to break that 3805 resistance tomorrow and SPY to break that key 379 resistance tomorrow. Once those levels are broken tomorrow and next week we can look for futures to shit 3840 to 3900 (next week) and SPY will look for 385 tomorrow and 388-390 next week. 

Bear case- we saw SPY reject that 379 breakout once again. If that is truly resistance we will look for a retest of 375 support and then a true test of 370 support of the purple channel. ES futures will look to test that 3744 level that is seems to be super support right now. 

Overall both charts are 100% sideways stuck between 370 and 390 SPY since June 11th. I think this is where we are stuck. I think we are going to see a run into next week with earnings coming up which are all going to be mixed bags then we see FOMC end of July. Depending on how well they prep that markets for the 100 bps hike this could be where we finally sell off. It could be we see a drop from FOMC to the next CPI on August 10th which they are projecting to be 9.2% right now (we just had 9.1%). 

While I still do NOT recommend any swings here or going long on anything… I am bullish at 370 and bearish and 390. 380 im neutral. And will remain there till I see something otherwise.

AMD had a great day today and I had a GREAT day scalping it for the first time. It opened up hella green saw a nice sell off then a very nice recovery EOD. Overall it did reject key breakout resistance of 79.5 though. If we were to break through 79.5 tomorrow and close over it I would look for a 7dte long call for next week with a 87 price target. If we break down through 75.5 blue channel support I will look for a 7dte put for a target of 71.8 if not 70 for the black dotted support line which is now 6 months old.  

10% challenge-

Great day today. I early recognized that we were building a bottom at 371.6 and refused to drop into any puts at that time. Once I saw the dark pool glitch I knew it was time for calls. I took profits early along the way. Had I just let them ride all would have been easily 100% profits. I have heard numerous times “your TA is great, your entries are great and you are correct often… but you are skittish.” And I will say this is 100% correct but this market has made me skittish. I can only trust this market 5 second at a time. I would rather take 10-20% profit along the way to ensure I get profits instead of letting it ride and ending up big red at the end. 

Worst plays today were attempting to scalp puts against the trend. Never fight the trend…

Note- I played one contract only on AMD plays today as im learning it still and took profits early.. lots of nice 5-10% scalps there today… I wanna test this some more before I go too heavy in plays… I did one normal size position today though.

This was quite the wild day today. They literally ran here all day long. This morning we started out with the narrative that “inflation has peaked… its all good… no worries here!”

The algos had really no bad news to pick up on all day today. Everything was nothing but how CPI is backwards looking and that everythings gonna be just fine. No one I mean no one was forward looking to FOMC and what things could mean…

Que the end of day… and what do we get? We get massive news about 100 basis point hikes and those are 100% not priced in right now. This feels just like right before the FOMC in June where they kept it all good everythings great then all of a sudden WSJ drops a news article about 75bps hikes and the next two days were blood baths.   
 

If you want my actual opinion.. and this is not TA based by strictly opinion… someone high up purposefully leaked that 10.2 CPI fake article yesterday. What it did was triggerd ALL the algos out there to dump. And it did that day. And then it came out it was fake. But you know what? Those algos now see that we have 9.1% inflation (worst in decades!) but it reads it as less then the 10.2 so the reaction is not nearly as bad. This in my opinion was MASSIVE psyops being played out on algos and retail… Its just like the WSJ article for 75bps hikes… they never release things like that but it was ironically released just in time to let the markets know to price it in before FOMC…. Okay rant over back to TA!

Okay today we are going to take about the VIX first cause this things truly pissing me off. I can not still fathom how underwhelming the vix reaction was today to CPI. The average move has been about 13% by the vix from low to peak and today we barely saw 10.8%. The VIX is not reacting normally at all and I believe this is what is propping markets up right now. The volatility is not there at all. Until the VIX kicks in a move there is no long positions worth playing at all. 

January 12th- vix moved 7.6% total, February 10th- vix moved 22.8% total, March 10th- vix moved 12.6% total , April 12th- vix moved 13.9% , May 11th- vix moved 12% , June 10th- Vix moved 12.7%, July 13th- vix moved 10.8% total… very underwhelming… VIX didn’t even break 30 today…

The Daily chart is starting to form some obvious trends the only issue is its hard to trust… you can see we have a nice inverse head and shoulders forming that should take us to 370 minimum and possible 365 at the lows. However, after todays bullshit its hard to trust and be able to go long for this. 

Todays open and close did show us a few things though. We rejected the daily 8ema again (bearish), we closed under yesterdays low (bearish), we gapped filled (neutral) and we bounced off 375 (bullish). 

Right now I am seeing 375 as support and 382 as resistance. Until one of these two levels are broken we aren’t gonna see the big move. 

Bull case- 375 was higher low bottom today and we will break out back above 380 tomorrow and close over the daily 8ema breaking the red dotted resistance line and look for 400+ by end of month. For this case to play out markets have to price in 100bps hike over night (or have done it EOD today), fomc has to be beautifully executed and earnings have to be positive af… if we get all that there is a case to be made that bottom is in.

Bear case- today was the worlds biggest bull trap. There is historical accuracy that spy is one day late to react. Today I think is that day. Bears already blased through the black dotted support line and closed under it we will now be looking to complete the inverse head and shoulder and close closer to 370 EOD tomorrow and look for 365 EOD Friday. This would complete the inverse head and shoulders. From here this would be the 2nd test of the weekly 200ema at 363 and could finally break us through it. 

Neutral case- we are going to fuck around and find out what JPOW wants to say and do end of July at FOMC. We are stuck in this purple 370 to 390 sideways channel. This is where we are going to maintain for quite a while until we get some sort of amazingly bearish or terribly bearish catalyst. 

10% challenge-

Weird day today… so I alerted yesterday that overnight puts were the play… I, however, decided it wasn’t worth gambling 30 and 50% profits overnight on a 50/50 win. I didn’t carry anything but my UVXY calls over night… they opened around 40% but when I saw VIX wasn’t gonna get on board yet again I closed them from 27.8%. Which is sad cause that is about what I should have closed them for yesterday before market closed…. In general I think next Cpi 2 days before playing 7dte ATM uvxy calls would still be the play assuming vix is near 25 again.

From there I played the probability and got burnt… I watch the IV probable highs and lows and its resistance/ support that I rarely see broken. I did not anticipate that we had the strength to break through it and knowing that almost every CPI had closed lower than it opened I played some puts on the 10am rejection there and saw a quick 20% only to get absolutely wacked faster than I could get out of them. I attempted to average down once at 1115 when it looked like we topped and got wrecked. Overall I closed them for a pretty massive loss at 145pm only for it to dump next candle. That dump woulda saved me 20% loss. But I don’t know if I woulda closed either… 

I was patient EOD waiting for the sell off and scalped a nice full remaining BP 50% 0dte put scalp. Woulda been 150% had I held but wasn’t worth the risk.. I set a 50% stop limit when I saw 60% profits and wasn’t gonna gamble… it didn’t give me a green day… but it did give me a green week still. 

https://preview.redd.it/d7kvgs52geb91.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a43f1f28f9ea3fdd1ff6f32f747fbc243e783e7

Overnight I am holding these… I am going with the bull trap narrative and that the next 100 bps is gonna get priced in today and tomorrow. 

My break even is 371.75 (-1.8%) for tomorrow and 366.5 for Friday (-3.6% ) from todays closed… I think we get that 370 test tomorrow and that its worth the risk.. if the VIX ever gets back on board this should also get a nice IV pump on a bigger drop too. (see below) but 5 out of 6 post CPI days have also been red with 4 of those being significantly red (with the average being -2%). However, I did not recommend NEW overnight puts as almost all of those days as you can see below did not open with any significant pre market drop. 

Biggest lesson today for me was you may be right but your timing may be wrong. In the end being patient and waiting for my play instead of anticipating the play is always best. Had I waited at 10am for a confirmed breakdown in theory there should have been enough left for plenty of gains. However, that doji at 1015am was highly unexpected and did come out of nowhere and all things pointed to heavy bear at the time. In the end the less here is that we CAN NOT ever make a trade that will blow our accounts up. One single trade should NEVER be enough to end your trading career. If it is you went to heavy. I recommend 5-10% per trade. That means that if you have 10k in your options account (again not full net worth) that you only trade $500-$1000/ position.

This morning around I believe it was 11am I was looking at my charts and noticed while we sat near 374 and had only seen a HOD of 377 that the daily range was already saying we had touched 380.53. I thought that was odd. I checked the daily candle and sure enough… it looked like we touched 380.53. I thought well that’s odd so I checked TOS and webull and they said the same thing! We had only see $4.44 of movement but they were telling us we had seen nearly $8 of movement… And my initial thoughts were a glitch or I miss a 1minute candle blip. Nope all clean and PM never even broke 380. 

So of course I first thoughts are we are going to see then run it to 380.53 range before they dump it… and what did they do? They ran it to 380.66 and IMMEDIATELY reversed it. I don’t know what kind of market fuckery that is right there but I have NEVER EVER seen anything like that before.

JPM is saying we wont break about 400 SPY (doubtful we fill the gap now at 410.5) and we should see about a 5% drop to 360 SPY and we are positioned for about 300 SPY worst case scenario. 

So with this information lets take a look at the daily and clean it up a little. 

https://preview.redd.it/kqadeaf9wt891.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e121b1cb065a8319be53fbe88bf598dce69fedf0

We are holding the black channel support so far. I suspect us to break through that black dotted support line of 373 tomorrow. 

We now have a red dotted bear channel forming.

If you note on the daily using the black solid line and the red dotted support line we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge which means we just might see that 300 price target by end of July if things don’t improve. But we are on a clear path to 358 SPY right now. 

https://preview.redd.it/8ttfmhrawt891.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa24215e041521f21c10f8a8d5975500a7e147f8

The weekly chart is what interests me the most… we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge forming there with the floor near that 350-358 price range for next week. I have a feeling now that we 1. Rejected breaking through weekly 8ema and 2. Broke down out of blue bull channel we are going to start our next sell off. 

We have been seeing for about the last 6 months now that the last week or first week of a month we get a change of trend… we are now due for a sell off. 

As much as I would love to say this is the time to go long 60-90dte puts I just don’t think it is…

What I think we are going to see is that SPY is going to trade between 360-380 until end of July. End of July bring a shit storm of things for us. 

We have Junes FOMC minutes releasing July 6th,  CPI on July 13th, FOMC on July 27th, GDP on July 29th (which most likely will be negative and confirm a recession), and then we also start earnings around the 2nd to 3rd week of July. 

I have a feeling earnings are gonna be dog water and with this last two weeks of July shit storm brewing we MIGHT have one more bull week or at least sideways week left in us before we finally see capitulation and get the next move down with a  price target of 300 SPY by September.

My ONLY saltiness about today is I KNEW we were going to sell off EOD when we kept rejecting off of 380 but I was too scared to enter after yesterdays fuckery. I finally entered and had a position up about 40%... I decided to lock in a 25% stop limit sell order on the 0dte JUST IN CASE she turned against me. But I had VERY VERY strong intuition she was gonna see 100%+ profits… Well she triggered at 32% as you can see above in my log. I then only had $26 in BP left so I bought a 0dte 373 to let ride and of course as you can see within 4 minutes it was up well over 100%... It hit 150% at its peak. Had I just held on and believed I would have had 100%+ profits. 

But that’s how this market goes. The days we don’t secure profits like I did today or at least protect us from the downside is the days we get absolutely rocked like I did yesterday. And the days we do take profits are the days it perfectly hits our PT. The 11.4% and 10.7% I played earlier were the same thing a 10% stop limit just in case that triggered and both those went to see 100-200% gains also. This market is such a mind fuck on being able to trust the chart and indicators but also protecting yourself from tom-foolery. 

\*\*\*\*Friendly reminder to anyone NOT in my server\*\*\*   
 I am going to be out of town starting tomorrow as I am flying to vegas/ grand canyon to get married this weekend and then the following weekend will be vacationing to see my family. I will be very spotty in my posts. I will have a weekly TA up that I plan to be very detailed (got a 5 hour flight to write it) and then i plan to trade next wednesday if I can. Other then that besides a random quick daily Ta if I have time I wont be back to full time trading till July 12th when I return from vacation fully. After that I have no more trips planned and kiddos go back to school beginning of next month.",2022-06-30,50,23

**Last Week –** Markets made another outsized move last week, this time to the upside. SPY was higher by more than 6%, a significantly larger move than the 2.7% move options were pricing. That follows weekly moves of more than 5% lower the past few weeks. The majority of last week’s move higher happened on two days, Tuesday to start the week, and Friday to end the week.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.4% move for the upcoming week (about $9 in either direction), which is slightly less than last week. This week includes the end of a month and quarter for markets on Thursday (so an additional ETF expiry on Thursday) followed by a weekly expiration Friday into a 3 day Holiday weekend. So a lot of variables that options sometimes have a difficult time pricing.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 27, down from 31 the prior week. From last week’s write-up:

>the VIX was near 35 several times last week which is close to the highs the VIX has seen in earlier spikes this year (March and early May). In both those earlier cases a VIX above 35 marked a temporary low in the market.

A VIX spike to 35 once again marked a tradeable low in the markets. Prior market bounces this year ran out of steam with the VIX 19 in early April, and 23 in early June before stocks reversed lower. The VIX is still historically higher than average.

### In the News

One month ago we checked in on oil & gas stocks and noted that despite the stocks “crashing higher” alongside the price of oil, implied volatility in the equity options was not spiking like implied volatility in commodity options tends to. That left equity options vulnerable to underpricing a reversal in oil prices:

>For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100. Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either.  
These stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have “crashed higher” towards all-time highs alongside oil itself, but the implied volatility of options in the single names are acting more like a stock near highs and less like a volatile commodity near highs where one typically sees IV *increase* as the commodity price goes higher. Meaning Puts and Put Spreads in particular may cost less than might otherwise be expected. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge.

The commodity side of things did indeed reverse the past few weeks, to the tune of about 15% in some cases. And Occidental (OXY) and Exxon Mobile (XOM) followed suit. OXY and XOM are both down roughly 18% in the past month, even more than Oil. XOM options are pricing a move of around 20% for the rest of 2022. A move that wouldn’t even take XOM back to its highs of a few weeks ago. This is one example of how the expected move can be used as a gut check versus the stock chart itself, a way to see implied volatility for what it truly is… how options are pricing moves in the stock versus how the stock is actually trading.

vg2uld_SPY,SPY,SPY Long/Short Indicator Derived from OLS Model and some macro independent vars,"This is a model I build using a linear regression to produce long and short signals for SPY. The dependent variable is a 50 day future return while the independent variables are:

* 12 month CPI percent change,
* differences between spreads for 10Y-2Yr and the 10Yr3Mo yields,
* SPY to high yield spread (AAA Bonds)
* GLD price
* Moody AAA Corporate Bond Yield

The Adj R Squared is 0.46

It is currently overfit and I still have some work to do but thought I would share. The OLS model is trained using data from 2000 to 2014 and the rest of the predictions are on unseen data.

Anyhow the big takeaway here is that it continues to predict negative returns over the next 50 days for SPY and actually some of the worst predictions to date.

I look forward to constructive feedback. Has anyone gone down this rabbit hole?

First image is the regression summary. 

Second image is the cum sum of the return assuming you follow the signal. This is overfit but thought I would share anyhow. The reason it is overfit is because I trained the OLS model with data from 2000 to 2014-1-1 and this obviously starts at 2000. Got to run now but I can update with post 2014 data later.

This daily chart is so impressive that with todays gap down we actually essentially completely negated yesterdays candle. Todays candle hit perfectly at the resistance from Tuesdays candle and obviously fell lower. Not only do we now have THREE gaps in one week (this might be the first time ever in history too) we completely rejected the resistance line at 370 too. 

Tomorrow just to break the first resistance line you have to break 371 intraday tomorrow. Arguably there is a pretty big case that we drill lower but with quad witching day that might result in a pop upward. 

I did some research on the quad witching days…

Weekly wise we pretty much just confirmed we are going to see our 10th of 11 weeks red unless SPY pulls out some uber impressive 5.95% green day tomorrow… (interestingly enough a day near quad witching in June 2020.. the covid crash… we had a 5.91% green day outta no where…)

I am watching a new black dotted channel down on the weekly. We also came within $1.04 of bouncing directly on the weekly 200ema at 363.04. That’s a major support and you see the orange dotted like is the WEEKLY support for 2020 post crash recovery (the weekly and daily supports are slightly different). If we hold this 200ema this week that could lead to a small bullish bounce next week but if we were to close under that 363 tomorrow I suspect things to get really nasty.

Here is the 1 hour VIX chart… a couple important things to point out. From 3pm yesterday until 3pm today we were in a very steep rise in the VIX. However we once again rejected to make a new higher high on the chart. We also hard rejected at 34.8 today EOD which gives us a perfect rejection at the top of the red channel. Its pretty safe to assume from here we should revert to the mean of 30 now. 

&#x200B;

On the 15min we can easily hit the 29.8 support line by EOD tomorrow. The thing I am thinking about now that the markets know about the 75bps hike, terrible inflation, etc. etc. What really is there for markets to be scared of or to provoke more fear in the VIX to raise it over the hard rejection level of 35? CPI, FOMC, and earnings aren’t till next month, yes we have FOMC minutes EOM I believe but other then that what really is there out there? I feel at this level the VIX will unwind more than it is going to head to 40. Just my personal feelings. 

Now this does not mean we are going to see a massive bull run as if you remember in May and early June we had the VIX unwinding while SPY dropped further/ traded sideways. So if markets agree on price/ direction there doesn’t necessarily have to be an increase in the the VIX. 

10% challenge-

Pretty great day trading for me. I actually played quite a few UVXY puts today and those paid and were easier to play then SPY today. SPY has been pretty much a an irrational meme stonk at this point. But despite not starting trading till about 1230 and only using 50% BP it was a great day 2.3x daily profit goal. 

The only lost I took today was that 5dte put… I entered at 215pm right before that massive rip and rejection to 366 before we dumped. I played myself in my head thinking with quad witching day we would see a huge rally EOD and bailed. It woulda been hella profitable if I had held 10 minutes longer.   
 However, lately my worst trait of trading is not cutting losers fast enough. So even taking that 8.8% loss I still easily secured 2.3x daily profits today. Had I NOT cut that loser and it really did rip to 50% or 25% loss I woulda had a red day. When taking small profits in a market like this we gotta limit losers. 

I also need to start taking profits instead of doing trailing stops a few positions were up 8-10% today well actually almost all of them were but I let the trail trigger or a stop limit (UVXY) and had I just taken the higher profit I would been at 5x daily profit goals. 

Its that risk and reward between taking profits early and letting your winners eat. In the end to me IF we protect ourselves from downside and still end green we won.

I could quite decide what to play overnight but with the VIX hitting that massive 34.8 rejection EOD I went with a small UVXY 1dte put. Looks like I will need about a 3-4% drop to 16.5 for break even on the UVXY put but I suspect if VIX unwinds like I think it will we should see UVXY near 15 and SPY near 30 by EOD and this be a nice gainer. For a small lotto I felt best about this compared to SPY. Ideal situation is obviously a massive green gapper tomorrow for SPY which drops VIX overnight.",2022-06-16,33,20

If you read my TA last night and my CPI breakdown yesterday mid day you note I mentioned that there was a very high probability we would open red today. I also mentioned if CPI was to break the April 8.5% (which it did at 8.6%) that we could see our first CPI day that drills to the core of the earth like it did today.

We opened red and she just never stopped drill red from 830am until about 1015am. From 1015 on though SPY was pretty untradeable. We pretty much hovered between 390.3 and 392.1 all day long. There was a pretty convincing shorts covering rally EOD that did attempt to break out, however, it was clapped down pretty quickly resulting in SPY closing at its LOD. 

So where TF are we at now after all this shenanigans today? 

https://preview.redd.it/iap3nyhmev491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a182ec77b9bc3861ee7a24f57b9e4e2944982a75

On the daily we left a MASSIVE (one of the biggest ive ever seen left untouched) gap of $5.66 unfilled. There is little chance this gap is left unfilled. It might take a few days to do it but there is a very high probability at minimum 50% of this gap will be filled. I actually believe we see it filled on Monday. 

If you look at where we closed today its at the candle body support of 389.7 area. This was the bottom support for May 12th and May 20th and the resistance for May 19th. The day also closed out in a bullish reversal hammer candle. We have seen the classic hanging man candle play out the opposite many many times before on SPY. 

https://preview.redd.it/8av9zt2nev491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ead21679ac38209885d8486702e693a3d2c16a9

On the weekly chart if we close under 395 and especially if we close closer to 380s next week we are going to see the weekly 8ema cross below the weekly 100ema for the first time since the covid crash… the last time it crossed was about halfway through the crash too… 

As I mentioned in my TA yesterday spy weekly was shaping up to break down underneath the support line at 400 today and it sure did. We now have an official triple top on SPY with the recovery support line being broken now. This makes 9 of the last 10 weeks red. And interesting enough 10 of the last 11 DOW JONES weekly candles are now red… this is the first time since the GREAT DEPRESSION! That this has happened… I don’t know who the fed and everyone else is trying to fool but we are one negative GDP reading away from confirming we are in a recession and I can guaranteed our future children (or grand children for some of you) will be reading about this in their textbooks in school. This is what you call the big one… I stand by 360 end of summer…

https://preview.redd.it/zvchbjpnev491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cda1682d1d4353a6512815f8aa91c69b5ed5a02

The VIX played perfectly into the trend today too. I was looking for 30 and we hit 29.63 not too bad. That 29.6 is a major level for the VIX too. With a hard rejection there and close under 28 I favor a retest of 25.5 before I favor a break out over 30… As you can see we can very close to that resistance line too. Close enough for VIX means to call it a rejection as you can see some of the rejection points have fallen just shy of that major resistance line previously. 

My anticipation is to see the VIX unwind Monday back near 25.5 which will allow for the gap fill (or most of it) on SPY Monday. 

Bull case- SPY finds bottom here at 389 range, FOMC meeting comes out and reassures markets and markets rally through and above key 415 triple top resistance. 

Bear case- SPY fills the gap Monday or Tuesday. FOMC meeting comes out and scares the living shit outta the market (JPOW might just throw the 75bps hike at us or at least hint to it next month since hes a coward and cant actually be proactive), markets tank and close near 385 support. 

My anticipation for next week is that Monday is going to open big green. Think back to the last few FOMC meetings and other huge green days after fed talks and what not. What always happens? The markets OVER REACTED and the following day the market takes away everything it just gave up. Usually markets react bullishly though (as of late) and then the following day is when we see the -3 to -4% days. MY thoughts and weekend play is that the VIX spiked purely from an overreaction, SPY dumped from a shell shock seeing that inflation hasn’t peaked. 

Monday we will rally close the gap. Tuesday is the day before FOMC and most likely will be completely sideways as markets are unsure what to expect. JPOW (hopefully) finally grows some balls and hits us with a 75 or 100bps hike. Markets dump into the 380s. From there I think we start getting some more of the msft earnings adjustments and we will start to see layoffs, worse jobs reports, etc. etc. that will cause the full on crash (-20% S&P 500). My soft targets 360 end of summer with an aggressive target of 285-300 by end of summer to mid fall.

Based off the FOMC data we are actually pretty likely to see a green day on Monday too (granted with this CPI reaction things might be a little different). It also is a fairly high bet play calls the night BEFORE FOMC, however, with the expectation that feds might do 75-100bps hike puts might be the better play. The last three FOMC meetings as you can see intraday after the 230pm release markets have absolutely rocketed. If JPOW can come up with some good bullshit for us and not scare the markets with a 75 bps (which is a death sentence to the markets and our economy later on) we should see a similar reaction. IF JPOW says anything about more rate hikes, increasing this one or next rate high above 50bps you can pretty much expect another -3% red day on Wednesday. Depending on how JPOW handles things Wednesday is going to determine the next month of the markets (which June is historically a bearish month). 

10% challenge-

As many of you know I had a rough month of May and early June. I after Mondays bullshit made some MAJOR changes to my trading strategy and I have to say its been incredible. Today I did play the odds slightly and got burnt. I played a morning call when it looked like we were going to triple bottom off 394.8. There was a VERY high probability that we would bounce from there before selling off EOD but unfortunately we kept drilling. Other then that the 5/5 indicator strategy today played beautifully.  I will be sticking with this increased patience. 

This revised strategy (which many on my server are calling “the old DD” is realizing we don’t need to play every bounce, dip or breakout. In the end we need to make 10% on one good trade a day and be happy with that. Some of us saw 100-200% gains on that put over night and many of us lost some of it intraday trying to get more gains. 99% of the time most of us when we hit our daily goal would do better just turning the computer/ phone off for the day.

Interestingly enough my overnight swings actually accumulated to more gains this week then day trading (granted had I not wasted my swung puts gains intraday today I would have finished higher then the swing total. But 3 for 3 on swings this week isn’t bad at all. 

Was able to bring my total win rate back up to 78% this week which im happy about and my loss mitigated win rate to 88.5%. 4x’ed my new weekly goal (and nearly met my old weekly goal). I look forward to next week with staying conservative and taking some more of these small wins. Patience is key in this market, I unfortunately EOD today was not patient and let it bite me.

These are my overnight/ weekend swing plays. I have actually never played a UVXY (baby vix as some call it) option before but its been highly recommended on the server and with VIX rejecting 30 and suspecting we see a drop down closer to 26 It feels like a great play for the weekend. 

I also entered 393C Monday expiry calls as I am banking on the gap fill play Monday. At absolute minimum I expect SPY to touch 395.6 range on Monday. But I wouldn’t be surprised to see SPY open 1%+ green Monday (assuming nothing amazingly stupid happens over the weekend).",2022-06-10,63,70

### In the News

Amazon stocks has a new look Monday following a 20 for 1 split. Options positions from Friday will be x20 contract-wise on strikes now divided by 20. New trades going forward will be using the new strikes. There’s no general rule for how a stock and its options trade following a split. Studies have shown some differences between small and large-cap stock volatility post-split. Many stocks will see a period of increased volatility (also reflected in the option IV) following the split that takes a period of time to settle down into a new normal. However, AMZN’s split occurs in a market that has been volatile and IV that is still somewhat elevated vs historical averages. The only thing traders can look for is any increased retail interest in what are now much more reasonably priced (dollar-wise) options. This could affect things like upside skew and the potential for spreads or selling options vs stock that can benefit from skew in a way that retail was previously unable to affect due to the large dollar prices of most options in a $2000+ stock. Something to keep an eye on.

It initially looked like Alphabet would do its announced 20 for 1 split this week as well but it is now likely mid-July. Amazon shares saw a fairly decent run-up into its split. GOOGL options are pricing about an 8% move out to July 15th:

v05o4k_PATH,PATH,Bullish SPY play to the upside that will cost you very little.,"Fed minutes were good, right?  We're seeing a nice relief rally and it could have some legs. Come Tuesday if the economic data we get is either neutral or positive we could start to see some short covering.  Last week we had companies like Macy's, Ulta, Dell and Costco all do well on Friday.  When Victoria's Secret, HP and Salesforce report... as long as they don't shit the bed I see no reason why the rally won't continue into Wednesday.  The part we need to watch is the middle to the end of next week (wed-fri) where we may start to see some choppiness and yet another reversal depending on what comes out for the economic data (especially non-farm payrolls next Friday).

But for right now, does anybody remember how a few weeks ago when we (collectively) couldn't imagine breaking 410 from 460?  Well, here we are. I was kicking myself for not buying a few random OTM contracts ""just in case"".   Now?  We're !EXCITED! about going the other direction and the possibility of consolidating above 415.  Now, put contracts are CRAZY expensive.  People have caught on.  I for one made a killing while the market was crashing but you either need to get creative or plan on playing the reversal if you want to keep making money.  I plan on doing the latter.

Let's look at the June 22nd expiration for our initial analysis. Let's look at the SPY 6/22 430 call and the SPY 6/22 400 put.  Both are both 30 points away from the current stock price and there is a drastic difference between the two contracts.

A 430 call is currently priced at: 3.680.  353 in OI and 20.78% IV with a delta of 0.283.

A 400 put is currently priced at: 5.200.  168 in OI and 25.26% IV with a delta of -0.2817.

Now, maybe some wrinkle brains can explain to me why there is less OI yet the IV is higher on the 400p contract... but overall, based on the fact that the 400p is about 50% more expensive (which is the same with other similar contracts similarly spaced out) we can confidently say people are betting on the market going down.  This isn't something I just cooked up on my own either.  I've been hearing people talk about this on streams and reading about it here and in other subs.  People have been betting on the market to crash for the last 7 weeks and they've been right. For 7 weeks. But now, we're starting to see a reversal and the question is whether it will continue. Admittedly, it might not.

Next up, let's look at the play I'm making and why I think it makes sense to play the reversal this way or in a similar way at another strike.  TLDR: Feel free to let me know if you think there is a better play somewhere else.

This play is kind of a hail mary but it's a well CALCULATED hail mary and honestly, it's incredibly cheap.  A 460 call is currently a whopping 0.160.  Nobody in their right mind thinks SPY will hit 460 at any point in the near future. IV is only 18.98 %.  Relatively speaking, compared to all the put contracts this is a great deal. Take a look for yourself.  The picture below shows puts at a similar distance from the current price of 415 as 460 is.  Everything is 30% or higher. I'm not saying buy the calls simply because they're a great deal, I'm saying I'm buying the calls because not only are they cheap but I think there is a great possibility we keep ripping and we actually get there.

Want some technicals?  Here's the graph. Those trend lines terminate at 360. If we continue on the same path as we've been going, the June 22nd 460 call contracts will be IN THE MONEY before June 7th.

https://preview.redd.it/4gwp83jo0d291.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=2416ad7dbb416e1289f6aa7336924b790ccac53b

We've been seeing moves as big as 3-4% up or down, right? I'm looking back at SPY and I'm seeing moves as big as 20 points in 2 days (from close the day before, to open the day after).  Keep in mind, I'm not saying we WILL get to where these contracts need to be in order for them to be profitable, but if we see some short covering or if retail earnings and economic data come out positive/positive, why wouldn't we see another move of 3-4% up on Tuesday into Wednesday? If we end anywhere between 427 and 430 (3-4% move) by the 2nd (2 trading days), the 6/22 460c will be worth $15-30 based on what I'm seeing here. This is per contract so multiply the profit by the number of contracts you buy.

In order to track the progress of these moves I put together a VERY simple excel chart.  Take a look.  It tracks how far SPY needs to go, day by day, weekends included, in order to stay on pace to hit 460 by the 22nd.  This is our break-even.  If we start to go below our break even, we bail.  If it keeps ripping, we either buy more or hold.

Me personally?  I picked up 10 contracts middle of last week and I'm already up 50%.  Between you and me, that's my profit target for my daily plays, but this?  I think I want to hold out for more than a $60 gain.  How about you?

Well another day another full ass reversal that makes 100% no sense at all. This is how I know the markets in a weird place when reversals start happening over and over again I know markets ready to make a big move. I favor a bull run over the next two weeks leading into CPI on 5/11/22.

In all retrospect though we pretty much had a sideways range day trading within a $5.57 range. With major support at 414.5 and major resistance at 418.

I hate to scream manipulation or just overall BS on intraday movements but the fact the VIX unwound from 32.72 all the way to 29.26 end of day and SPY didn’t see a 2%+ rally is a little sus for sure. Intraday watching the volume and the VIX you could tell it was being artificially clapped down and forced to trade here within this 414.5 to 418 range. It didn’t want stay under 414.5 and it sure didn’t wanna break that 418. The odd thing is that 418 really was not a major support at all. 420 I could have seen rejection there and strong resistance but 418 really doesn’t add up. 

I think the MM had this held down until JPOW drops the rate hike tomorrow personally. But we will get true market sentiment tomorrow morning. 

&#x200B;

See where we are at right now and where they pinned us at? That’s right… they pinned us right against the bear channel resistance line that’s going on two weeks long now (started April 21st). So that means we are either going to see a massive move down again or a massive breakout. Personally I favor the breakout. I think over night we are going to hold this 415.7 support and trade near 418 and break the channel over night and see a fairly bullish morning and once (and hopefully once) JPOW cements it with the 50bps markets will see a massive EOD rally tomorrow and trade higher into the end of the week. 

Now if JPOW comes out with something wild like a 75 or 100bps hike well we are gonna get that massive sell off and break that 400 level.

&#x200B;

On the daily we pretty much are leveling up as the week goes on. With bouncing off the 405 support and finishing at 415 support yesterday. Today SPY attempted to break lower but ended up rejecting resistance at 420 (failed to make it there officially) but managed to hold support EOD at 415.

Tomorrow SPY Bulls will look to break that 420 level and break the now resistance at the daily 8ema of 421.13. An ideal finish for bulls tomorrow is above 428 resistance which means they need to see a larger 2.8% move tomorrow, but at minimum bulls nee this to close above the daily 8ema and closer to 425 which is a 2% move tomorrow. After two days of less than 1% closes it seems like a tall order but with the vix near 30 it should be fairly easily especially on a big fed news day. 

Tomorrow bears will look to break that 415 support and close at or below the 410 support level. This would be easily obtained if JPOW drops the 75 or 100bps hike. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4xym733fwcx81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5efd825c277d0630b73a291226ef5ce3c5a6fc4

Personally I think we see the 50bps hike. From what ive been reading and hearing the expectation now is three 50bps hikes (May, June and July). The narrative is currently inflation is peaking so it would be a little surprising to see something outside of that. JPOW with the exception of January has also been very predictable and the market likes predictable. So unless we see the 50bps at 2pm and then JPOW during questioning says something to spook the market I really forsee a fairly green rally tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple had a great day today in terms of longer term bullish momentum. As I had mentioned very rarely does Apple drop more than one candle in a row below the 200ema and look at that they closed it back above the daily 200ema which now sits at 158.17.

However, bulls were not able to break that daily 8ema at 160.35. I will look for bulls to close near that daily 20ema at 163.59. Bears will want to see this closed back under the daily 200ema tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

QQQ is in a similar position of SPY with it leveling up but failing to breach its daily 8ema and failing to breach the next level of resistance which is 323 for QQQ. 

QQQ bulls will need this to break 323 and aim for a close closer to that next resistance level of 328 for an end of week rally. Bears will look to break back below the support at 318 and push for another lower low by end of week.

The VIX had a pretty massive day today actually. I was impressed to see it unwind from its heights of 32.82 to its low of 29.06 for a total of 12.9% movement downward today. But SPY failed to see and do anything with this. Normally a movement like this would bring SPY to the moon but as I mentioned the intraday volume clearly was keeping SPY down. 

Now that we are back closer to the currently happy VIX spot of 28 to 33.5 it will be interesting tomorrow to see if the VIX rockets back near 33 of if its going to start its unwind back down to its 2022 average closer to 18-21. 

10% challenge-

Today was a good and bad day. I made some great trades this morning that unfortunately were erased by that end of day dump. I truly expect us to reach HOD end of day but it just didn’t have it in the cards today. 

5/3/2022 Call 1dte 8%

5/3/2022 Call 1dte 5%

5/3/2022 Call 1dte 3%

5/3/2022 Call 1dte 18%

5/3/2022 Call 1dte  -50%

The last one on my log the 1dte calls at -50% I ended up selling half my current position and decided to ride the rest till tomorrow and put some faith in JPOW and the market to have a rally tomorrow. Either way cutting that at 50% today takes 1/3 of my risk off the table as I am carrying actually a lot into tomorrow that I don’t normally do at all. Its definitely not what I had planned but my calls got wrecked so fast and I failed to exit when I had the chance at -30% so decided I was just going to let them ride. With hopes of an IV spike tomorrow morning/ afternoon due to JPOW and just overall feeling bullish I made a calculated play. Overall if my call positions go to -100% I still wont be hurting too much. Overall it would hurt but it is what it is at this point. Putting faith in JPOW to get that printer on one last time. Overall for all three of my positions I wil need to see 425 tomorrow if IV was to remain the same to breakeven.

Hyperwheel wise I was able to roll my puts one time for a small credit so im getting close to beating buy and hold. 

I was looking for an EOD rally but that didn’t happen to close these puts at a pretty nice profit but right now I am slightly green and as of now letting them ride. With these not expiring till Friday and my break even already about $3 lower then when I sold them due to theta I feel pretty confident that by Friday these will be profitable to roll into next week green. Worst comes to worse EOW I will roll one more time till next Friday expecting a rally next week.

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours… its still a break and that’s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here?

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked…

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green à red. Red. Red. à green -> red. Red à green à red red red à green à red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too.

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)… we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p… There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k…. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k… even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k… that’s nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting.

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break.

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57.

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis… a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again… definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week.

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out.

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don’t like to hold positions over night… 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there… but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don’t believe in what you are trading and you don’t believe in the move that’s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",2022-04-14,14,11

The day before CPI… the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. 

The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish).

We actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.

We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. 

But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.

The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. 

&#x200B;

The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. 

Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mymji2jgqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7450d1700fb29082bfcb0ccde34638e1f82d5157

Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). 

Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). 

Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. 

Thursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.

That is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. 

With the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. 

Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. 

Channel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. 

I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.

The blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. 

I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. 

&#x200B;

Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.

Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. 

Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. 

&#x200B;

QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. 

Channel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. 

I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.

The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. 

&#x200B;

When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. 

Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. 

While some don’t think it’s a great correlation Crypto took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. BTC broke its major support and is now below 40k and ETH broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",2022-04-12,11,10

Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). 

Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). 

Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. 

Thursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.

That is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. 

With the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.

Apple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. 

Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. 

Channel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. 

I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.

The blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. 

I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. 

&#x200B;

Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.

Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. 

Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. 

&#x200B;

QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. 

Channel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. 

I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ. 

&#x200B;

The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz4j8manqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=85501a00d711a631528288d3e261e0acbb5213e5

When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. 

Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. 

While some don’t think it’s a great correlation Crypto took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. BTC broke its major support and is now below 40k and ETH broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",2022-04-12,13,10
tsirle_SPY,SPY,What's a semi-accurate best guess on what parties are responsible (and at what % of volume) for the roughly 1-2b shares of SPY traded monthly on average?,"Obviously we will never know EXACTLY who/what traded every share.

But I'm curious if we have any data available to us that can help us understand the markets better.

BlackRock has IVV, Vanguard has VOO. From what I can tell, SPY is managed by State Street Global Advisors.

I know the options chain is obviously part of a certain % of volume (probably a small one) because puts/calls getting exercised will always trigger shares trading hands... right? I can only imagine the complexity of the SPY options chain and won't pretend to understand even a fraction of it. The only question I have is... is it responsible for 90m shares trading a day alone? Probably a not.

I don't think a lot of 401ks or pensions or any other retirement accounts where average Americans dollar-cost-average a portion of their paycheck income/savings end up in SPY. That takes out ""institutional investing"" into SPY, right? If not... what institutions are buying SPY? What product are they offering on top of it, and to who? How large are they? Why wouldn't their customers just buy SPY themselves?

I don't think retail traders/retail day traders/retail swing traders/anything retail are a huge % of the market when speaking about a daily volume perspective. I don't know how big the retail trading market is (on a daily or weekly or monthly scale) but I'd love to learn more. I'm going to guess it's 5-20% of daily volume, being extremely generous. I agree that it's asinine to even think retail is responsible for 20% of daily volume but... I literally can't even estimate/guess/come up with a hypothesis on where the other 95% of the daily volume from SPY comes from. 

Do other asset management companies (who aren't big enough to have their own S&P ETF offerings) charge their clients a fee to put their money in SPY for them behind the scenes, and they are daily rebalancing? Is that where some of the volume comes from?

I know a lot of algorithms are fighting each other for fractions of a penny all day at rapid speed, shaving nanoseconds off and frontrunning buy/sell orders from Robinhood (and others) to make money at scale. But... they can't just trade in between each other all day, can they? Like... there are only so many Robinhood buyers, and all of their volume isn't going to SPY... If ""market makers"" are behind the majority of volume because they are providing liquidity, who are the buyers and sellers on each side? We already determined the majority is not retail, not institutions since they would be targeting mutual funds instead of the ETF.

The market is open from 9:30am -> 4:00pm (6.5 hours, 23.4k seconds). If you ignore pre-market and after-hours (not sure what % of daily volume these two trading windows are responsible for, I'm going to guess less than 10%), you're talking about roughly 2b shares traded in a 21 day window, roughly 95.2m shares per day, just over 4,070 shares a second. What parties are buying and selling 4k shares a second every second of every trading day on average for the entire year on average?

> According to a 2017 JPMorgan analysis, passive investors like ETFs and quantitative investment accounts, which utilize high-frequency algorithmic trading, were responsible for about 60 percent of overall trading volumes while ""fundamental discretionary traders"" (or traders who evaluate the fundamental factors affecting a stock before making an investment) comprised only 10 percent of the overall figures.

Meme/story stocks saw an uptick in activity last week, with unusual options volume and in many cases, increases in implied volatility. Here’s some highlights from last week with special focus on stocks that saw spikes in volume and IV. Many of these stocks had reached low dollar levels, so a quick change in sentiment ramps option volume and prices quickly. Increases of option volume vs 30 day average (on Friday), implied vol vs 360 realized vol (on Friday), and IV Rank that was unusual are indicated. This is by no means an exhaustive list but gives a good sense of what was happening as traders turned their attention to these types of stocks after a long lull:

**BB:** option volume: +600% IV30 vs 1yr: +136%, IV rank: 100% (earnings, expected move this week: 11%)

**BBBY:** IV30 vs 1yr: +148%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11.5%)

**GME:** option volume: +800%, IV30 vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 13.5%)

**NKLA:** option volume: + 400% IV30, vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 9.5%)

**TLRY:** option volume + 2300% IV30, vs 1yr: +207%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 20%)

**CRON:** option volume: 1000% IV:30, vs 1yr +155%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11%)

**ACB:** option volume: +2000% IV30, vs 1yr +194%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 17%)

**RIOT:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 9%)

**FUBO:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 8%)

Whether this is a “dash for trash” towards the end of a big move higher in the broader market or the beginning of a turnaround in fortunes for stocks that had been left for dead remains to be seen. But it’s a reminder of how quickly increasing option volume can lead to large leaps in option prices in stocks with a history of “crashing higher.” Here’s a quick look at how many of these names show up on volume scanners from Friday (via Options AI):

### In the News

Tesla (TSLA) stock’s breakout in the Fall of ’21 took it from under $800 to over $1200 in the span of a few weeks. After a late year pullback to under $900 it made another run to $1200 to start 2022. During the market lows of last week it traded as low as $700 before finishing the week back above $800. In other words, it’s been volatile. Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves. Looking ahead, options are pricing about a $45 move in either direction for this week and about a $105 move for the month of March, even though the stock has seen those types of moves in a single day recently.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sbvkum525gk81.gif

Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls.

Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock’s moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops. But in this case TSLA stock has been moving wildly since its big breakout and hasn’t stopped making large percentage moves, both higher and lower, since.

During the market lows of last week it traded as low as $700 before finishing the week back above $800. In other words, it’s been volatile. Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves. Looking ahead, options are pricing about a $45 move in either direction for this week and about a $105 move for the month of March, even though the stock has seen those types of moves in a single day recently.

Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls.

Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock’s moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops. But in this case TSLA stock has been moving wildly since its big breakout and hasn’t stopped making large percentage moves, both higher and lower, since.

t2u3ku_SPY,SPY,I’ve been investing in SPY for over a year. Would it make sense to buy a lower cost ETF instead?,"I’ve been using Schwab and I initially chose SPY because of its liquidity & time in the game. 

However it has a net expense ratio of 0.09% vs something like VOO’s 0.03%.  

Since I’m never planning on selling my assets, I might as well choose the lower cost one?

I feel a little odd stopping SPY and starting VOO, but would love to hear from you if there’s anything I might be missing? Is there a better ETF tracking the S&P 500 on Schwab I should consider?

Thanks!",2022-02-27,56,72

**Last Week –** **SPY** was lower by about $8, or 2% last week, less than the 2.5% ($11) move options were pricing. Implied volatility is about the same as last week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 2.4% move this week (about $10 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** – The VIX closed last week just shy of 28. It had a range of about 24 to 31 during the week. As mentioned last week, traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop as it has been changing fairly significantly day to day (and even intra-day). What position is chosen when the VIX is near 20 or when it is above 30 can add headwinds or tailwinds to those positions, even trades with short time horizons.

### In the News

Cryptocurrencies have bounced off recent lows but are still significantly lower than their Nov 2021 highs. One of the more high-profile equities in the space, **Coinbase** reports this week. COIN is down nearly 50% since Nov 21. It is lower than its IPO reference price of $250 and significantly lower than the intra-day high it saw on its first day of trading (above $400).  


Options are pricing a move of about 11% for earnings, (or about $21). With the stock $187, a $21 move lower would take out recent lows. In other words, the bearish expected move would mean a new low. And on the upside, a $21 move higher would not reach the $220 resistance level. In other words, the bullish expected move is not pricing a move back to obvious resistance. You can see the difference in probability assigned by the options market at those support and resistance levels.  


https://i.redd.it/9pm1fzd3z8j81.gif

This can help inform strike selection beyond or inside of the expected move. For instance, those that are bullish could target the resistance level for the potential for extra reward beyond the expected move. And for those that are bearish, the options market is *not* putting a lot of weight on the stock being able to hold that support level if the stock goes lower on earnings. Therefore a move lower would be into uncharted territory, a situation that has seen outsized moves lately in other names.

And finally, BTC options are pricing about a 6% move this week, less than the 11% COIN options are pricing, for those that see COIN trade more as a proxy than anything else.

### In the News

Macro news is still front and center, with inflation, Fed moves, and Russia/Ukraine headlines causing day to day sentiment shifts. Amidst that backdrop have been some fairly eye-popping moves following earnings. Meta/Facebook and Amazon were two of the largest mega-cap earnings moves in recent memory. As stated a few weeks ago, earnings during a high implied vol environment can have unique characteristics. From Jan 23rd:

*Options have a harder time pricing near-term events. Earnings are a great example. If overall market volatility is at or below historical averages, the expected move for an event like earnings is almost entirely pricing that day’s potential move. But in a case where options are pricing potential market moves of over 3% for the week, options need to account for potential market moves in the days leading up to or after the event. A company reporting earnings may see 80% of its potential move reflected in its options premium with the VIX 16, but it may be closer to only 50% with the VIX above 30. There’s also the potential for outsized moves to the downside on earnings while market sentiment is so poor. This is the “shoot first, ask questions later” phenomenon. Netflix earnings last week are an example. Another effect of elevated vol is that short gamma in the market can accentuate near term and intraday moves.*

Meta’s move was an example like Netflix, with a massive move lower following disappointing news. But on the flipside, Amazon blew out its results and saw a massive move higher. The options market wasn’t even close to correctly pricing either possibility, and there was a lot of short gamma in the options market to help supercharge those moves. SNAP also saw a massive move higher, albeit in a much smaller market cap situation than AMZN.

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% last week, a move less than the 2.5% options were pricing. It was higher by more than 3% at one point mid-week. Implied volatility contracted on the week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a nearly 2% move this week (about $9 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** – The VIX closed last week near 23, down from nearly 28 the week before, and down significantly from near 40 on January 24th. January 24th marked the lows of the recent selloff. SPY is higher by about 7% since then, with the VIX down more than 40%. Implied volatility is still slightly above historical averages, indicating some remaining trepidation about the bounce, assumptions of more day-to-day swings, or simply lingering inertia from the large moves of the past few weeks.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2%** (about $9)
* QQQ **2.6%** (about $10)
* IWM **2.8%** (about $5.50)
* DIA **1.7%** (about $6)

### In the News

Macro news is still front and center, with inflation, Fed moves, and Russia/Ukraine headlines causing day to day sentiment shifts. Amidst that backdrop have been some fairly eye-popping moves following earnings. Meta/Facebook and Amazon were two of the largest mega-cap earnings moves in recent memory. As stated a few weeks ago, earnings during a high implied vol environment can have unique characteristics. From Jan 23rd:

*Options have a harder time pricing near-term events. Earnings are a great example. If overall market volatility is at or below historical averages, the expected move for an event like earnings is almost entirely pricing that day’s potential move. But in a case where options are pricing potential market moves of over 3% for the week, options need to account for potential market moves in the days leading up to or after the event. A company reporting earnings may see 80% of its potential move reflected in its options premium with the VIX 16, but it may be closer to only 50% with the VIX above 30. There’s also the potential for outsized moves to the downside on earnings while market sentiment is so poor. This is the “shoot first, ask questions later” phenomenon. Netflix earnings last week are an example. Another effect of elevated vol is that short gamma in the market can accentuate near term and intraday moves.*

Meta’s move was an example like Netflix, with a massive move lower following disappointing news. But on the flipside, Amazon blew out its results and saw a massive move higher. The options market wasn’t even close to correctly pricing either possibility, and there was a lot of short gamma in the options market to help supercharge those moves. SNAP also saw a massive move higher, albeit in a much smaller market cap situation than AMZN.

shgbpj_SPY,SPY,Exactly how risky would it be to invest in 100% SPY LEAPS?,"As someone early in their investing career (age: mid-late 20s), I’m thinking about putting 100% of my money in as many SPY LEAPS contracts as possible with the longest expiry date possible (which is just under 3 years)

If SPY is expected to go up in the long term, then my LEAPS on average should also be very profitable. Sure, there might be years where my LEAPS expire worthless due to temporary corrections/flash crashes/bear markets/etc, but then I can just buy more LEAPS during market downturns that will provide out-sized returns as the market recovers balancing out the contracts that expire worthless (maybe even out-performing expired contracts since downside risk is limited with options as compared to just holding 100 shares)

Another idea would be to close out contracts a year out before expiry date to limit the risk of contracts expiring worthless and losing value to theta decay.

**Last Week –** The **SPY** was essentially unchanged last week although it saw intra-week moves of close to 1.5% in either direction. Options were pricing about a 1.3% move.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move (about $7 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $464 that is a range of about $458 to $472.

We’ve highlighted the 15% or so range (in either direction) that **TSLA** stock has traded in since its breakout in October 2021. The stock has found resistance at the $1200 level and support near $900. The stock finished last week near the center of that range. The company reports earnings Wednesday Jan 26th. Here’s a look at an Iron Condor in the Feb 18th (monthly) expiry. The short strikes of the fly set at the recent support and resistance. You’ll note that is roughly in line with the expected move options are pricing. The risk/reward of the $5 winged Condor is about 2.70 to 2.30. In other words, options are pricing a move to recent support or resistance for earnings, and a breakout or breakdown would mean options were underpriced into the event. (via Options AI):

I mean, doesn't seem like a bad idea.

(Disclaimer: We could always finally have a true correction over 5%, so this would be a bad idea)

I plan on waiting till Wednesday to make sure CPI follows through before throwing down large 1-2 month out ATM SPY calls. If we're still around 465 or lower, I will probably buy. I will set SL's and make sure to be careful around the MA's.

Will still be playing 0dte on Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

**Last Week –** SPY finished last lower by about 1.9% (or about $9). That was more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing a 1.3% move (about $6 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $466 that is a range of about $460 to $472.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday just under 19, higher on the week. Expected moves for this week are near historical averages.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)

### In the News

Last week I highlighted the range options were pricing in Tesla into its first trading day after new vehicle numbers:

*“TSLA stock finished 2021 at around $1060, in the middle of a range for the final 2 months that saw highs above $1200 and a low just below $900. Tesla is set to report earnings the last week of January. Options are not pricing movement outside of that recent high or low until February. Here’s how that range translates into a $25 wide Iron Condor expiring Feb 18th, about a $1400 risk to $1000 reward profile (via Options AI):*“

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/gqyd4tvuqpa81.gif

TSLA made a big move higher right to the 1200 level to start last week. It failed there and pulled back sharply from that level and actually finished lower on the week overall. With the stock now $1027 its expected move for this week is roughly 6%, with consensus levels around 1090 and 960, and the expected move out to February 18th about 15%, with consensus levels around 1180 and 870.

IWM (Russell 2000 etf) has been in a range for most of 2021 with a failed breakout in November. It has been testing the lower end of that range as recently as Friday. The expected move in IWM into year end is about $9, which to the downside would mean a breakdown below its 2021 range, the bullish expected move of about $225 would put IWM right back in in the middle of that range:

rii4gp_DE,DE,DeJa'Vu possible FED Day repeat … Warning. 12/16/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY.," 

Goodmorning traders, Yesterday I said the rally does not have legs and here we are. Today is really important as to how next we plays out. It is expiration Friday, so big moves are likely. Picture the market being a runner and that you can only run so far before you are out of breath. When you run out of breath and got tired instead of putting your hands on your knees or walking to cool down you consolidated or walked/ran backwards to cool down. Also like any runner you build up your distance and endurance each time you run. This is the market right now; it is building up endurance to run (longer sell offs) and these sharp rallies are cool down periods. Which brings me to a conflicted moment. There is a level that if we fall below it opens up the pandora’s box of sell side activity. That level I believe to be around 450 on the spy. Can we build up enough endurance to run that far, will large fund managers join the selling to get us there? I have said that large fund managers are doing everything they can to hold on to getting their bonuses for this quarter by piling into a few mega cap stocks to window dress portfolios (can they hold it together thru the year end?).  

Key levels to watch... Resistance 465, 467/468 and 470-472 area. Support 462, 460 and 458-456.  I see this shaping up just like the fed day we start pushing lower and when you think we are going off the cliff we reverse with a sharp bounce. Look for bounces in Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft to be the start of the turnaround on the day. Todays close is important, if we fade going into close, we could come into next we with a huge gap down so be careful.

rfeu5a_SPY,SPY,S&P 500 Growth ETFs hit record highs and have beaten SPY over 10 years,"S&P 500 growth ETFs hit record highs on Wednesday and are outperforming the benchmark SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) year to date.

The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VOOG), SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG) and iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IVW) all recorded intraday highs on Wednesday's session.

All three have also outdone SPY’s +25.5% YTD performance. VOOG is +30%, SPYG is +29.9% and IVW is +29.8%.

S&P 500 Growth ETFs are made up of stocks that display the strongest growth characteristics based on: sales growth, P/E ratios, and momentum.

Moreover, the funds have very similar trading performances because they're essentially the same fund offered by different issuers.

Each ETF tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500 Growth Index. The two key differences between the ETFs are their assets under management and their expense ratios.

IVW leads the charge from an AUM vantage point with $39.42B under its belt. SPYG comes in second with $15.25B AUM, followed by VOOG at $4.65B.

Expense-ratio-wise, SPYG is the cheapest of the ETFs with an expense ratio of 0.04%, while VOOG is the second most costly fund at 0.10% and IVW is the most expensive with a ratio of 0.18%.

Fund flows for the three ETFs seem to follow expense ratios. Lowest-priced SPYG attracted $2.59B in inflows so far this year, while the second-most-affordable fund VOOG brought in $1.06B, according to etfdb.com. However, IVW − the most expensive ETF of the three − lost $1.67B to outflows.

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week 3.5% higher (or about $16). That was more than the 2.4% (or $11) options were pricing for the week. Implied volatility fell sharply with the move higher in the market.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1.3% move (about $6 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY $471 that is a range of about $465 to $477.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 18, down sharply from 30 the prior week. That means expected moves quickly went from historically high to more in line with historical averages in a few days.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)

* SPY **1.3%** (about $6)
* QQQ **1.8%** (about $5)
* IWM **2.5%** (about $5.50)
* DIA **1.4%** (about $5)

As mentioned last week:

*“If the market were to find footing implied volatility could quickly contract, although on some of the higher moves last week volatility stayed bid, as expectations for short-term swings remained high. The VIX is now in backwardation, meaning front month volatility is now slightly higher than outer months. But even outer months are historically high.”*

Volatility did quickly contract. The SPY ended the week up $16 but most bullish long premium strategies needed that large move higher with options already pricing an $11 move.

VIX futures are now back to a fairly steep contango after a brief spell of backwardation. December VIX futures dropped from 28.50 to 20, while Jan and Feb dropped from around 28 to about 23. May dropped from 27.50 to 25.50. Volatility assumptions for the next week few weeks are now lower than assumptions for January and beyond.

## In the News

**Crypto**

Bitcoin enters the new week in about the same spot as last week, just below 50k. Options were pricing about an 8% move last week, it stayed in about a 5% range. Options are pricing about a 6.5% move this week (options expiring Friday the 17th), slightly less than last week. ETH options are implying about an 8% expected move this week.

**Tesla**

Tesla closed last week near the low end of its recent range. Options are implying about a 9% move into year end which corresponds to about $1100 on the upside and about $925 on the downside. *Via Options AI:*

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* The economic danger of restrictions to control the new omicron form exceeded optimism about vaccine efficacy in the United States, causing equities to fall and bonds to rise.
* The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both fell, capping a three-day rise, as consumer discretionary and real estate companies led the market lower. After a weak sale of 30-year bonds, treasuries pared their rise. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index crept closer to 22.
* The cost of containing the omicron strain is being calculated, as there is growing concern that it would stymie the economic recovery. According to Bloomberg Economics, new work-from-home guidance in the United Kingdom might cost the country's economy £2 billion ($2.6 billion) per month. According to one study, the omicron variation is 4.2 times more transmissible than the delta variant in its early phases.
* The global share rise could be derailed further by US consumer inflation data on Friday and a Federal Reserve meeting next week, which could provide indications on the pace of tapering and interest rate increases.
* The dollar strengthened on Thursday as a report showed that applications for state unemployment benefits in the United States had dropped to their lowest level since 1969. However, economists have raised concerns about the seasonal adjustments required to arrive at that figure. Initial claims increased on an unadjusted basis.
* Stocks in Europe reversed early gains to trade marginally lower. Among the individual swings, electricite de France sa dropped as the government considers a cap on regulated power rates to help reduce growing electricity prices. Meanwhile, Unicredit spa increased after announcing that it will return at least 16 billion euros ($18.1 billion) to shareholders by 2024.
* In Asia, China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. officially defaulted on their dollar debt, while the People's Bank of China boosted its foreign currency reserve requirement ratio for the second time this year, following the yuan's highest level since 2018.

r6udbv_RIVN,RIVN,SPY - $450 - Trade sideways for a few weeks.,"On InvestorEmpire I've found and tracked a TPO chart feature called ""one-time-framing and halfbacking"" that proves to be a pretty good technical indicator. I've noted it in RKLB, RIOT, AMD (hasn't half-backed yet, but you wait), and RIVN, as examples.

SPY showed this pattern at the weekly.

If true - then SPY will trade sideways for a few weeks. But, I fully believe SPY defies reality because it is an index of a huge basket after all. But - I'm convinced by my research that I wouldn't buy puts or calls within a month time frame to be honest.

Anything within a month is likely to get IV crushed as consolidation around $450 occurs. I don't think there will be enough price action to make up the difference.

If you know what one-time-framing is on a TPO 30minute chart you'll recognize it plain as day here:

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* US Stocks fell in a global selloff as fears grew that a new coronavirus type discovered in South Africa might trigger new outbreaks and jeopardise the fragile economic recovery. The value of haven assets soared.
* It's the S&P 500's worst post-Thanksgiving performance since 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill making the fourth Thursday in November a national holiday.
* The Russell 2000 index fell 3.7%, and the Nasdaq 100 index fell to its lowest close in nearly two weeks. Stocks in the travel and leisure sector fell, while those in the stay-at-home sector rose. The Stoxx 600 index in Europe fell 3.7%, the highest since June 2020. For the first time since late September, oil dipped below $70 a barrel in New York.
* Treasury yields jumped on haven bids, with the 10-year yield falling to its lowest level since March 2020 on a closing basis, as traders pushed back bets on the Fed raising rates.
* With the dollar sinking, the Japanese yen emerged as the main safe-haven currency of the day.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks slumped on fears that rising inflation may jeopardize the global economic recovery, prompting central banks to raise interest rates sooner than expected. treasuries rose.
* Traders took some risk off the table as data revealed a slowdown in new home development in the United States, implying that builders are struggling to break ground on projects due to high material prices and continued labour shortages. Target Corp. fell after warning that cost pressures are increasing, fueling fears that inflation may eat into retailer profitability. The NASDAQ 100, which is heavy on technology, beat key indexes, spurred by a rally in tech titans Apple and Tesla.
* According to GS' CEO Solomon markets may face a rough period as the economy attempts to recover from the rapid impact of the epidemic. If interest rates rise, it will ""take some of the euphorias out of some markets,"" he said in an interview at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore.
* The worst quarter for the S&P 500 since the pandemic appears to have scared off some do-it-yourself investors. According to the SEC and market data compiled by major newswire Intelligence, the retail trading surge that began with lockdowns has now subsided, with total equity volume from individual investors falling to 19% in the third quarter, down from 24% at the start of the year.

qshs16_NET,NET,Cumulative net premiums on SPY flows are about to turn positive,"A lot of puts have been bought without success during the current bull market. Ironically, the market tends to correct, or have retracements, once the puts buying loses steam. The current difference between large call and put flows is about to turn positive, reaching a level last seen in January before the tech correction.

There is currently a lot of outstanding call premiums at $460, which is likely to act as resistance.

At the moment, the market is still led by cyclical and sensitive stocks, with the defensive super sector gathering less interest. At this point, caution would be warranted, not in expectation of a correction, but simply as prices keep making new highs.

qr6w73_WMT,WMT,"Buying SPY, and selling calls on it?","Hey everyone!

I'm furthering my education in options, I've made some money, and I'm pretty comfortable doing things.

I took around $3,000, did some put credit spreads on SPY, and made about 25% on my money.  Today was a bloodbath of course, but I'm still up over 14% in just under 2 months.

So, I'm looking at a few ideas, and one of them was to outright buy 100 shares of SPY, since I'm comfortable owning those shares, and then selling calls on it on a regular basis.  Basically, it's a wheel strategy, but just buying the shares outright first.

What are your thoughts on this?  Is there a better way you can think of if you had $50k available to invest with that level of risk?  I like SPY mainly because of a stock has a bad day, you have other stocks that will generally pick up the slack.  I've looked at other stocks like MSFT, WMT, etc, but before I went too far down the rabbit hole, I figured I'd ask all of you what you thought?",2021-11-10,11,78

qd7mu7_MA,MA,Aggressive SPY Iron Condor Strategy Proposal & Backtesting Results,"I've been playing around backtesting opening up Iron Condors against the S&P500, creating a strategy that relies on a very high win rate to make up for the low return.  The strategy shown in the pic is using Bollinger Bands with 60 day window and 5 standard deviations, but plenty of other slight variations like 90 day 3 standard deviations get similar results.

For the backtesting, I open up the Iron Condor on the 1st trading day of the month, and close it on the last.  From looking at current option prices based on the model's current recommended strikes, I estimate I can get at least %4 return, and no greater than %10 return, but I'd like to get historical Option prices to verify.

This Monday, from the proposed strike prices I was able to open a condor expiring 11/10 for 6% (strikes at 415/416 & 470/471) and another condor on 11/19 for 9% (so $6-$9 for each 100$ of collateral.  Benefit of a condor, as I'm sure many of you know, you effectively double your collateral since only one side can expire in the money).

[Red Horizontal Lines are Put Strike Prices \/ Green Horizontal Lines are Call Strike Prices \/ Dashed Vertical Lines are Start of Each Month](https://preview.redd.it/noqwpneaywu71.jpg?width=1012&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8dde4421bd0f8b7b36aff107b6266736acf7cc3d)

&#x200B;

I'd say the results below are the best I've achieved, which probably means I've overfitted, but nevertheless experimenting with other Bollinger Band parameters and also using 200 Day MA I've gotten Win rates of +95%, which, assuming I receive 6% return on each Condor, should keep the strategy at least profitable.

I'd say there is definitely additional risk opening up these spreads when below the 200 Day MA, so in real life I may increase my spread or just sit it out.  But typically, above the 200 Day MA, the market behaves in the nice expected trend line until the next Black Swan Crash event that can't be predicted.

Please provide any feedback, especially any concerns I may have missed about this proposed strategy! As mentioned, I've already put money to test this method, so far it appears to be behaving as expected but it is a bit nervewracking since just 1 loss will wipe out about 12 months of gains.

\-Open Condor at start of Month, expiration at end of Month

\-Condor Strike Prices defined by Bollinger Bands w/ 60 day window and 5 standard deviations

\-Let Condor Run to Expiration for each Month

\-No Rolling, Condor either expires ITM for Max Loss of $94 or OTM for Max Gain of $6

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.9% last week, more than the 1.3% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1% move (or about $4.50 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$446** that corresponds to just above **$450** on the upside and below **$442** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16, down from 19 the week before. The VIX is now below its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping, but January futures were down from last week, now just under 23.

With implied volatility slightly lower, options are pricing smaller market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs, all slightly lower except the DIA which is about the same as last week:

* IWM **1.6%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $442 and $450 to see Max Gain:

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 0.6% last week, less than the 1.6% move options were pricing. The SPY had an intraweek low below $428 on Monday which was about the lower end of the Bearish Expected Move before bouncing to finish the week above $437.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$437** that corresponds to about a $6 move in either direction, with **$431** as a bearish expected move and **$444** as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 19, down from 21 the week before. It was as high as 24 on Monday and closed Friday near its lows for the week. The VIX is about in line with its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping with January futures just under 24. Options are pricing more volatility towards the end of the year than now.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

With implied volatility slightly lower, options are pricing smaller market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs, all slightly lower except the DIA which is about the same as last week:

* SPY **1.3%**
* QQQ **1.7%**
* IWM **1.9%**
* DIA **1.5%**

As an example of how the 1.3% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $431 and $443 to see Max Gain:

**Last Week –** **SPY** was lower by 2.1% last week, more than the 1.1% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.6% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$435** that corresponds to about a $7 move in either direction, with **$428** as a bearish expected move and **$442** as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday above 21, up from 18 the week before. It was above 24 several times during the week. That means IV is slightly higher than its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping with January futures above 24. Options are pricing more volatility towards the end of the year than now.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

Options are pricing larger market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:

* SPY **1.6%**
* QQQ **2.0%**
* IWM **2.2%**
* DIA **1.5%**

As an example of how the 1.6% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $428 and $442 to see Max Gain:

**Last Week** – SPY was higher by 5%, less than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week** – SPY options are pricing a 0.8% move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. With the SPY around $453 that corresponds to about $449 as a bearish expected move and $456 as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was unchanged on the week and ended Friday at about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22, down slightly from last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week (via Options AI)**:

The major ETFs are all pricing similar moves this week than they did last week:

* SPY **0.8%**
* QQQ **1.0%**
* IWM **1.5%**
* DIA **0.8%**

The 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $450 and $456 to see Max Gain. Here’s an example on the expected move chart, showing the risk/reward and breakeven of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move. It's tight, but that's what a 16 VIX looks like vs Condors and other OTM credit spreads.

Covid booster shots are now a topic of conversation and Pfizer (PFE) may be available for a roll-out by the end of September with their FDA review scheduled for the 17th. Moderna (MRNA) will likely lag Pfizer and officials are recommending those that had the Moderna shots to wait for a Moderna booster. There is no timeline yet for review of a Johnson & Johnson booster. Here's how options are pricing expected moves for those three stocks out to October 1st:

Seriously though - from hanging men to evening stars ... XOM is ""bearish engulfed"". Financials are Hanging men. DIS is a doji. SPY itself is an evening star. Even inflation hedges like MO are a doji. GOLD is forming a bearish pennant.

I'd error on side of caution and think that the rest of the trading week will be sideways or slightly bearish.

**Contrary opinion:** Tech shows some strength to it which could help push SPY upward albeit against headwind. SPY is particularly resilient. Due to political manipulation basically if the SPY isn't going up +0.5% it is losing value. The market at large tends to have a slight down trend between 0.0% and +0.5% on the SPY.

And lately this has been happening when money cycles into Tech. Because Tech is acting as a giant vacuum cleaner right now sucking up all the liquidity, I'd argue, irrationally. Basically all the newbie ""retailers"" don't know that tech wasn't at extreme P/E multiples for 40 years for a reason.

All the babies know is ""MSFT"" and ""AAPL"" and they are throwing all their money into 40 P/E dumpsters. But who am I to comment...",2021-08-30,0,14

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was above 23 during the week, but closed around 18.50 on Friday following the market rally that ended the week. That is about in line with its historical average. The futures curve is upward sloping with December VIX futures around 23, up from 22 last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

The market ETFs are all pricing larger moves this week than last week:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.3%**
* IWM **2.1%**
* DIA **1.3%**

### In the News

The market’s move lower last week saw some demand for option volatility as the VIX quickly spiked towards the mid 20s. With the VIX now back in the teens and VIX December futures near 23, options are pricing about a 7% move by year end.

A Debit Put Spread to that level, buying the at-the-money 443 puts and selling a put at the Bearish Expected Move of 413 costs about 8.00 and breaks-even at about 435. It costs about 1.8% of the underlying but protects against about 5% of the 7% move options are currently pricing. For those looking for portfolio protection, those ratios and breakevens are one way to analyze potential hedges:

### In the News

Robinhood (HOOD) options were listed on Wednesday and the stock joined the ranks of the meme stocks, at least for a few days. The highest strike originally listed was $70, and initially, there were only monthly expiries. As we’ve seen in other meme stocks, the highest call strike becomes popular in retail, and $70 was where the stock closed on Wednesday as short gamma ran out above that level. The stock finished the week at $55. Weekly options and higher strikes have now been added (as high as $170). The $70 strike, August 20th remains the strike with the most open interest as of now.

Skew to the upside is sharp, with the 55 calls expiring this week around 155 IV, while the 75 calls are around 205 IV. Translation, positions that buy nearer to the money and spread by selling OTM are favorable cost/skew. The expected move for this week is about 15%:

oul6t9_MRNA,MRNA,I'm at a major corporate facility and learned that 20 minutes ago they were told no contractors will be allowed in their buildings without prior approval from corporate because of Delta variant concerns. This brings them back in line with their height-of-pandemic restrictions. SPY Aug 30 430 PUT,"I don't know whether the Delta variant actually  warrants extraordinary measures, but I'm starting to think that perhaps the country is going to put them in place and we're going to go back to pandemic height level restrictions.

However I do believe the market has got this priced in a lot better than they did in March of 2020.

This paragraph from a recent news report has got me wondering:

orkc0d_SPY,SPY,$5000 income/month from DVY and SPY since year 2004,"This post is not meant as a blanket criticism of dividend funds. It is for informational purposes only and to present the facts. The simulation generates an identical amount of income from DVY and SPY ($15,000 per quarter indexed to inflation). It achieves this from keeping the dividends, and selling shares if necessary. Obviously more shares are sold of SPY because the dividend is lower.

Starting with 1 mil, by 2021 there is 1.27 million SPY and 820k DVY. The DVY seems likely to deplete at some point. SPY is not quite keeping up with inflation either, but is considerably better.

The same sim can be run for SCHD vs SPY vs DVY since 2013. SCHD is much more competitive with SPY, but still lags slightly over the life of the fund (second link).

Remember the simulation generates an equal amount of income from each fund quarterly ($15,000 indexed to inflation). So you could have lived off of the $5,000+ / month for 21 years and still had 1.27 million SPY today, or 820k DVY. ($5000+ because indexed to inflation)

While historical performance is no guarantee of future success, SPY has outperformed both of these funds while providing the owner with an identical monthly. SPY remained ahead during the 2009 and 2020 bear markets. SPY also already contains many dividend stocks. Dividend funds may have their uses for active traders or those that believe dividend fund performance will improve in the future, or those that want to be ""overweight"" in dividend stocks because they believe their performance will be better than it has been historically. Dividend funds are also useful for those who don't want to look or think about their investments because they don't require selling shares to generate significant income. But anybody retiring from 2003-2013 would be better off today if they bought SPY, even during the 2009 bear market, and while maintaining an identical level of income ($5k/month) from their investments.

If one wanted $6000 income/month (18k/quarter) then the DVY would nearly deplete down to 167k. The SPY depletes also, but not as much (438k).

oq5lll_SPY,SPY,Retiring on QYLD vs SPY in year 2000,"I've been meaning to do this for a while now. QYLD total return including dividends back to 1995 is available from the CBOE website (the timeseries is called [BXNT](https://www.cboe.com/us/indices/dashboard/BXNT/)). Note this post is for informational purposes only and retiring on neither 100% QYLD nor 100% SPY is wise. Also, I would expect that the results for true dividend funds would turn out much better than for QYLD. I can run those simulations too if somebody would like.

The methodology:

I ran the simulation in excel. The left column is the annual total return index for BXNT(QYLD) and SPY from which I calculate total annual return. You reinvest all dividends every month acquiring new shares, but in January of every year you sell 4% of your total holdings in both QYLD and SPY and live off that cash for the next 12 months. **In practice, for QYLD this just means selling a portion of the new shares acquired from dividends but none of the original shares. For SPY, this means selling all of the new shares from reinvesting dividends, as well as some of the original shares.** The other 96% remains invested and earns the annual rate of return for QYLD(BXNT) or SPY. Assume retiring with 1 million.

&#x200B;

The results (see link below for excel spreadsheet):

In your worst year (2009) you would have 18.4k of income from QYLD vs 19k income from SPY. In 2021 you would have 42k of QYLD income vs 64k of SPY income. The incomes are nearly identical up to 2011 (some years QYLD is up to 1k more, some years SPY is 2-3k more). After 2011, the income from SPY becomes much greater. By the endSPY is over 50% more income each year. QYLD does not maintain the real value of your investment, while SPY is close. Obviously this was a bad year to retire.

You can also play around with the % sold in January every year. For example, a 3.25% annual sell rate is sufficient to maintain the long-term real value of the SPY investment. A 1.25% annual sell rate is required to maintain the long-term real value of the QYLD investment (which leaves you with almost no annual income). **This makes sense because the long-term total return since 2000 for QYLD is barely above the rate of inflation. You must reinvest 90% of your annual dividends just to keep pace with inflation.** You can see this in the CBOE total return index which includes the value of all dividends. The index peaks at 400 in 2000 and is at 800 today - roughly matching inflation despite reinvesting all dividends. If you had invested at the exact peak in 2000 you would have had to reinvest 100% of dividends to maintan the real value of your investment - leaving you with exactly $0 of income for the last 21 years. For anybody doubting that this timeseries includes the value of reinvested dividends - look at the growth from 2016-2021. As we know the price of QYLD didn't go up during this period, the growth in the index is the value of the reinvested dividends.

If somebody would like I can also create a spreadsheet for selling a fixed $$$ amount every January (indexed to inflation) instead of a fixed %. You can expect it would provide a stable but lower income overall with the results of QYLD vs SPY relatively unchanged.

I hope this has been helpful especially to anybody considering how to allocate retirement funds. I suggest seeking out professional advice while avoiding paying fees.

This can also be done in Portfolio Visualizer, but only back to 2013 because they do not have BXNT and only have the QYLD ticker. The following comparison withdraws $5,000 ""income"" every month and compares QYLD vs VTSAX. VTSAX is of course the clear winner, even maintaining its lead at the bottom of the March 2020 panic.

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished the week above its bullish expected move, up 1.5% vs the 0.8% options were pricing. The SPY has moved more than its expected move and established new highs over the past few weeks, while its implied volatility (and expected move) has compressed as moves have mostly been in one direction to the upside.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **0.7%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. That corresponds to about **$429** as a *bearish consensus* and **$437** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was lower into the holiday weekend, closing at around 15. That’s the lowest levels of market implied volatility since pre-pandemic. In January 2020, before the Covid sell-off, the VIX was as low as 12. Its historical mean is near 19 but that incorporates long periods of time of low volatility (and the VIX in the low teens) with occasional bouts of extreme volatility and spikes in the VIX.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22. In other words, near-term options are compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

Expected Moves for This Week (via **Options AI**):

oaiizo_NVDA,NVDA,UPDATE: I invest based on quantitative sentiment score on Reddit - I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since inception (but lost this past week). Last week's numbers and positions (and what I'm rebalancing into tomorrow morning),"Hey guys! Been posting the last few week about my project that invests based on sentiment analysis (I know you've seen sentiment trackers abound) and wanted to give an update and some new numbers. Long story short for the week -- ehhh. **IMPORTANT: Most of the below is a repost of stuff I've posted before, but there are new numbers and analyses that I do every week. Additionally, I've added/trimmed down as I get better at explaining the right stuff.**

&#x200B;

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below, giving me a -1.26% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.61% return for SPY and 1.44% for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF. I've thus far posted my wins, but this isn't some panacea -- there are often loss weeks and I want to highlight that as well. Still, a $100k portfolio invested at BUZZ's inception March 4 would be: $155k for this portfolio, $114k for SPY, and $114k for BUZZ.

&#x200B;

**Here's the** [**source code**](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)**!** Note: this does need to be edited according to your needs (how many of the top you want to invest in, how you want to deploy it, etc.)

&#x200B;

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO, sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC.

So, here’s the stuff you’ve been waiting for. The data from this week:

**WallStreetBets - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what’s in my portfolio)**

Estimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 300k-ish (I don't store all parsed comments, just the ones I need). This week, I cleaned up my data intake and purifying mechanism (I was picking up SI before, and don't think that was warranted) so the numbers are smaller than last week. I haven't done a full backtest using this new mechanism just yet, which I'm planning on doing tonight.

The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO, sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC.

So, here’s the stuff you’ve been waiting for. The data from this week:

**WallStreetBets - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what’s in my portfolio)**

Estimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 300k-ish (I don't store all parsed comments, just the ones I need). This week, I cleaned up my data intake and purifying mechanism (I was picking up SI before, and don't think that was warranted) so the numbers are smaller than last week. I haven't done a full backtest using this new mechanism just yet, which I'm planning on doing tonight.

nzhki5_SPY,SPY,Give me reasons to choose SPY over QQQ,"Title is self explanatory. QQQ returns have been superior to SPY over the large majority of the past years, plus I really cannot see how can tech fail in the next 10-20 years. Tech nowadays is everywhere and has become such a foundamental part of our lives that I cannot really see it perform worse than s&p500 (again, over a 10-20y span). Ok I get it, volatility might be larger, but I am planning to build a portfolio of money completely separated from emergency funds or daily expenses, so I do not really care if it goes -90% if on the long run it does outperform SPY.

What am I missing?

Bonus: for the same reasons mentioned, why should i not pick TQQQ over QQQ, or at least put part of the money in it? Ignoring volatility, it has had huge returns on average over the last years, and I really don't think ""leveraged ETF attrition"" will be so damaging to the point that tqqq becomes really worse than qqq over the span of decades.

Edit: I don't know if anyone will read this, but it is worth writing to warn anyone who wants to do this. Simply put simulations have shown that TQQQ would basically go to zhit in the event of another dot com bubble and would take a nearly unrecoverable hit if another 2008 happens. So is it worthless? No it is not: if you have just started investing and your total invested capital is relatively small to your income, it totally makes sense risking. Otherwise, stay away from Leveraged etf",2021-06-14,23,71

Options premium tends to spike when the stocks are squeezing higher and compress when the stocks have down days, or begin to go in either direction day to day. This is a dynamic traders should be watchful of when positioning directionally. It is not uncommon for out fo the money puts to lose money on down days in the stock, if vol is compressing.

TSLA stock has benefitted more than any other big cap stock by merging those two audiences. But now that Elon is picking sides in crypto one would think it changes the dynamic of his cult.

Halfway through the month we're up to $415.82 as of writing this, an increase of about $16 or about 3.85%.  The rally has been amazing with estimates for this quarterly earnings season being beaten by an average of 11%.  Big tech quarterly earnings reports the last week of April but in the meantime, one of SPY's top 10 holdings, JP Morgan beat estimates out the water.

SPY 05/19 $400C @ 18.67

Delta 0.7825

Theta -0.0953

Looking for SPY to dip next week, possibly will do so on Monday. When it does I'll pick up a few calls of SPY05/19. C $400  The Delta stands at 0.78 and Theta is -0.09. You don't want to buy calls with expiry dates close to earnings because of the volatility. Yes, you can argue that volatility makes money but I'm not here to argue, I'm here to secure profit and dip the fuck out. With the underlying fluctuating wildly after earnings, as it did with JPM (stock dropped $2 the day it beat EPS estimates), why gamble? Give SPY time to rebound by buying calls with expiry dates a month away.  It often happens we see a rebound in the opposite direction when expectations are met (& not met) with stocks. 

I'm holding a few calls right now, I like the $400 strike price. SPY jumped 1.07% today ($4.42). My SPY05/07 $400C I purchased during a dip on Monday jumped 22.16%, or $317.50. I've been averaging 65% returns on them lately and I figured I'll let the bulls steer.",2021-04-16,79,25

**SPY** options are again pricing in about a **1.1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $396.50 to the downside and $405.50 on the upside.

**Tesla (TSLA)** reported first quarter vehicle production numbers on Friday while equity markets were closed. Options are pricing in a roughly 6% move for the upcoming week, and about a 12% move for the month of April. The company is due to report earnings the last week of April. 

With the stock near $660, this week's expected move corresponds to about $620 for a bearish consensus and near $700 for bullish. That is much smaller expected moves being priced in TSLA options than what the stock has seen in recent week, both in its options and in its actual moves:

**Earnings This Week (light) and a look ahead**

Earnings season picks up in earnest the second week of April, beginning with some of the large financial institutions like **JP Morgan** and **Wells Fargo**. The latter part of the month features some of the largest tech names including **Netflix**, **Apple**, **Tesla**, **Amazon** and **Facebook**.

The calendar is pricing in expected moves in the weeks leading up to those earnings in late April so as the confirmed dates approach the options will begin to isolate the events themselves more and more.

**Tesla (TSLA)** reported first quarter vehicle production numbers on Friday while equity markets were closed. Options are pricing in a roughly 6% move for the upcoming week, and about a 12% move for the month of April. The company is due to report earnings the last week of April. 

With the stock near $660, this week's expected move corresponds to about $620 for a bearish consensus and near $700 for bullish. That is much smaller expected moves being priced in TSLA options than what the stock has seen in recent week, both in its options and in its actual moves:

Last week the major indices rallied to new highs. Options were pricing in about a 2% move last week and the SPY climbed by nearly 3%. With that, option volatility, as measured by the VIX settled near 20 to close the week.

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **1.5%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $388 to the downside and $400 on the upside. Here's how that 1.5% expected move compares to this week's expected moves in QQQ and IWM:

**QQQ 2.6%IWM 2.4%**

As I mentioned, the VIX closed lower on the week, near 20 Friday. Again, that wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. If one is trading pure IV out a month or more being short vol would have worked, but if one was trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... the VIX or individual stock IV is less important if the stock makes a large one-way move higher.

**Tesla** **(TSLA)** made a big move higher, helping to take the indices to new highs. Tesla (TSLA) was higher on the week by nearly $100. With the stock now just below $700, Tesla (TSLA) options are pricing in an expected move of about 7% for this week, down slightly from last week. Options are pricing in a roughly 15% move for the next month (to April 16th), also slightly less than last week. In other words, following last week's rally, Tesla options are pricing in less of an expected move now than they were a week ago:

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **2%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $376 to the downside and $392 on the upside. The Nasdaq and Russell saw wild swings last week and options are pricing larger moves for this week than SPY:

**QQQ 2.9%**  
**IWM 3.3%**

The VIX got near 32 on Thursday and closed below 25 on Friday after that monster rally back. Implied volatility in the big ETFs can sometimes have a hard time pricing two-way movement like last week. The indices were practically unchanged on the week but were seeing intraday moves larger than what options were pricing for the entire week. The VIX collapsed on Friday on that rally but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. In other words, if one is trading pure IV out a month or more those changes in VIX are tradeable. If one is trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... where the VIX or individual stock IV is at entry is less important.

**Tesla** is an interesting name right now as it's sort of representative of the selling going on in recent high flyers. Even with the rally Friday afternoon in the major indices TSLA closed down on the day by 4%. Here's a look at TSLA's expected move over the next few weeks via Options AI:

A note on expected moves. Options need to price in both the overall market volatility and the earnings event itself. So a company reporting on Monday still has a few days for the stock to move after earnings and before expiration, while companies reporting on Thursday can move with the market before they report. The percentage moves will be roughly the same barring huge moves in market IV, but obviously what the percentage moves correspond to in the stock will change depending on where the stock is into its event.

The expected move is extremely useful not only to get a sense of how the crowd is pricing moves but also on strike selection in any option strategy. An oversimplified way to think of it is that if you own premium with a breakeven beyond the stock's expected move you need the options market to have underpriced the move, even if you get the direction correct. And if you are a net seller of premium you want the options market to be overpricing these moves, especially if you get the direction wrong.",2021-03-07,445,129

I  was looking at the spy chart last night try to make sense of levels -  and a series of double bottoms jumped out me on the daily chart, so I  googled the dates - and they all align to negative stimulus news.

Examples: no second stimulus yet, stimulus pushed back, stimulus talks delayed etc. etc.

So  this market sell off - in my opinion (not advice, just speculation) -  is yet another instance of fake out/chop before the next leg up on Spy.

Expected moves are useful for spotting opportunity or managing risk but they are also important for trade strategies in options themselves, for instance with strike selection. I'll start with SPY, also check in on Gamestop, before looking at companies reporting earnings this week. With the earnings stocks, I've included their prior earnings actual moves for comparison. 

In case I missed something you're tracking, a searchable list with the expected move and prior earnings moves can be found on the Options AI calendar. Here's an example in [Zoom ZM](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ZM). Feel free to bookmark and use that, it's free. These moves are based on Friday's closing prices in options and will look slightly different on the open tomorrow.

**SPY** \- With the VIX around 28, SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move this week:

**Gamestop GME** is kind of wild (as you know), but what's really wild is that it reports earnings later this month and has a 75% expected move for the month, but it ain't because of earnings, no one cares about that. Its expected move for this week alone is 45%. In other words, it's all about the weekly options and retail demand for not so cheap upside calls:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zb5cdzqyjak61.gif

Speaking of Gamestop, I wrote again last week about how nuts the options are and that they're practically giving away call spreads when compared to out-of-the-money calls. Also, how directional butterflies can be used for bearish positioning, as implied volatility usually gets killed in these stocks as they go lower and out of the money puts can get crushed even while getting the direction right. Worth a read if you're involved in Gamestop or any similar stocks, the article is on LEARN [here](https://learn.optionsai.com/gamestop-and-high-volatility-options/) and is very similar to a post I wrote on r/options a few weeks ago. You heard it here first :)

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.

As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important. 

So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.

The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.

Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.

Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!

This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.

Speaking of Gamestop, I wrote again last week about how nuts the options are and that they're practically giving away call spreads when compared to out-of-the-money calls. Also, how directional butterflies can be used for bearish positioning, as implied volatility usually gets killed in these stocks as they go lower and out of the money puts can get crushed even while getting the direction right.

The test for SPY today will be at 361.33. If she can stay above the current resistance, then we will see a positive morning.

If not, depending on how far she falls, we could have a gloomy day in general - follow the white downtrend support and resistance.

CLIFF NOTE SUMMARY - SPY fell out of uptrend channel and into downtrend channel.

# Gameplan:

We're in store for another wicked gap down in the SPY (about 1.5%). Most major sectors are below their recent lows. The Q's however have been showing relative strength for the past couple sessions and that seems to be continuing today. If I had to guess, the smart money is rotating back into tech as we prepare for a continued uptick in COVID.

We're set to break below the channel again, at which point stops should be triggered if you were playing the first break. I'll be watching to see if we can get inside the channel again within the first 30 minutes or so. If that happens, I may be willing to get long with a tight stop below the channel and see if today will be anything like what we saw on 10/15.

If we go lower, they'll have to crack the premarket low of **333** first. Almost 2 months back when the indices initially pulled back, they found support around **333.** If it holds here, we could have a head and shoulders pattern in play.

If they go lower, I'll be looking to scalp the area of **329.50** for a quick bounce. This should provide strong intraday support at the least.

&#x200B;

Good luck today folks.

# Gameplan:

The exact number for the 62.8% retracement level is 343**.87**. Yesterday's high was 343**.85** & closed at 343**.78**. Any coincidences? I think not. 

We're set to open with \~$1.70 gap up. Overnight traders are near 100% net long and a fade move off the open is in play. 

How can you play the fade? 

1.) Safer traders can get short on the first 1-min candle to make a new low with the stop above the HoD. Use the targets above for take-profit. 

2.) A more aggressive play would be to get short immediately at the open with a stop above a premarket pivot such as **345.50**. 

&#x200B;

There's not much on the board today as far as number go. This is partially because we are in no-mans land on the chart. We are entering the large breakdown candle that set off this pullback and there is very little resistance above us. The last major technical level was the 62.8% retracement at **343.87**. With that being said, today will likely be the last stand for bears. Closing below the 62.8% retracement would be bearish. Closing below the previous breakout area of **342.50** would be even more bearish. Closing above would mean acceptance of these prices with higher prices to come.

&#x200B;

Good luck today folks & have a great weekend!

# Gameplan:

We haven't talked about the sectors in a while (QQQ, XLF, SMH, IWM, etc) so [here's a quick review.](https://imgur.com/a/kUR9F89)

Yesterday didn't make it over the highs of Tuesday's reversal candle, but for all intents and purposes, we reversed the reversal candle. Today we're set to open *above* the reversal candle high. The line in the sand is the same as yesterday. Above **338.75** were bullish, below and we're bearish.

As you look at the market profile above, notice the volume on these rallies. Both yesterday as well as Monday saw almost non-existent volume.

You can think of volume as a sign of commitment. On the dips, we saw big volume near the lows where buyers stepped up and bought up the market. On the rallies, sellers AND buyers have been pretty quiet. This leads me to believe that:

1.) Buyers are in control, but only at lower prices

2.) That could change on a dime

And thus, I will remain on the sidelines.

If you had to pick a side right now, it should be the bulls. Just make sure the risk-reward is there before entering a trade.

One trade I *would* be willing to take is... We make quick work of the gap this morning and run back through the open. If all this happens in the first 30 minutes, I'll be willing to get long at the open with a stop below the low of day.

&#x200B;

Good luck today folks!

# Gameplan:

Premarket trading is showing almost a 2% move lower on concern over Trump testing positive for COVID. I've seen this kind of reaction to news before and quite frankly, they never end with continuation. I'll be surprised if this doesn't prove to be one of the best dip-buying opportunities in October.

I added the market profile chart today because I wanted to point out a nuance at the lows of yesterday. On the chart, I circled the lows of the yesterday along with the prior 3 days. You'll notice there was a lot of volume traded right at the lows and regardless of where we opened today, my advice was going to be, ""If we get anywhere near **335**, look out. Lots of longs in the area about to get stopped out."".

If we open beneath **331.50** which is our current pivot low, look out for some more downside action at the open. If we're showing any signs of strength above **300.50** I'll be willing to take a starter position with stops below **300.50**. Assuming we get below **300.50** in quick fashion, I'll be willing to take a position at the gap with stops nearby. 

Outside of the morning trade, I urge you to use caution and size down as big moves are likely. Should be a good one today.

&#x200B;

Good luck today folks!

ivc4bj_SPY,SPY,SPY iron condor question - long instead of short?,"Hello!

I decided to try out my first ever iron condor strat on spy. My intention was a short IC that i would collect premium for up front, ride out until almost exp, and buy back lower.

My setup is this, all exp 9/23:

Buy 1 327 SPY put
Sell 1 330 SPY put
Sell 1 336 SPY call
Buy 1 338 SPY call

This should have netted me $144 credit based on the time i placed the order. I have sold covered calls in the past and when RH issued a credit, i see it pop up in buying power. This took $144 buying power from me. I panicked, thought i inputted my order long instead of short ic, so i tried to close it back and accidentally opened a 2nd IC. Again, it said credit, but acted like a debit and took an additional $147 from my buying power.

Am i missing something here? It seemed like i had everything in order. My buying power is showing me missing $291, thought it would reflect the opposite. 

Thanks in advance!",2020-09-18,1,4

What am I supposed to do? Do I owe Robinhood $600,000 dollars?

Hey all so exercised the call and I am NO LONGER IN A MARGIN CALL!!!! Although my buying power still shows -$1,400,000. Someone explained that this is still fine though so l I’ll update this post later tonight if anything changes thank you all

I swear I thought I was in big doodoo and didn’t even get an ounce of sleep last night

**I am in debted to all of you for helping me through this and some more than others. From the bottom of my heart thank you. If it wasn’t for you guys I would’ve been in absolute chaos.**

Update: Really I’m only worried about the negative $1,400,000 buying power but a lot of you ave reassured me that’s going away with nothing to worry about so hopefully by tomorrow morning it’s completely gone

Edit: if the negative $1,400,000 is still there tomorrow what are the next steps anyone know? Still a little shaken up by this tbh. But I know all of you reassured me this is going away soon and it’s nothing to worry about.

**UPDATE: I DO have margin on! Here is the image https://imgur.com/gallery/vH8qFgC , I have $50k on RKT and another similar amount in BIGC does this change the negative $1,400,000??? Does this mean this ISNT going away?**

**Last Week**

Options prices started last week pricing in a possible big move lower in the indices. When that didn't come to fruition (actual moves finished the week much smaller than expected moves) volatility compressed a bit:

* VIX closed Friday at 26.87, down on the week (from the low 30's).
* Last week's expected move in SPY: 2.8%
* Last week’s actual move SPY: -1.0%
* Last week's expected move in QQQ: 4.6%
* Last week's actual move in QQQ: -0.8%

**This Week**

Note the smaller expected moves for this week, despite the fact that last week had one less day of trading:

ipifsn_SPY,SPY,"Why buy SPY when IVV, VOO, and SPLG have better expense ratios?","SPY has a 0.0945% expense ratio while the other four listed all have 0.03% expense ratios and similar dividend yields? 

You clearly lose 0.05% compared to these other ETFs and over 30 years that could translate to 1.5-2% reduction in your portfolio. 

Is it because that 2% is pretty insignificant? On $1M that would be about $20K

Edit: So the answers I’m getting are volume related. However, others have pointed out that volume would only be more beneficial if I was trading options due to factors like liquidity and smaller spreads. I’m not holding options against my SPY holdings so I wouldn’t really benefit too much from that side. My strategy is more buy and hold for 30 years on this so the advice seems to favor a lower expense ratio ETF in that case.",2020-09-09,618,196

We already know that FB and Microsoft have benefitted from conferencing and everyone staying home during the lockdowns despite both (more the former than the later) having drops earlier this month.

So the earnings will be up (not that if they were negative it would change much) **so it's a very important thing to consider as the stock prices will likely go up.**

We already knew of the Qualcomm news with apple and factories in china starting to re-open production, will likely have a decent earnings which means the price will go up.

TSLA is arguably a scam stock depending on who you talk to, but puts rarely if ever, work on it, and it continues to climb. If there is a bubble to pop it won't be happening until it hits around or near $1000 per share.

***SPY was already up pre-market and continued climbing throughout the day today despite higher unemployment numbers, more business closures, and GDP contraction.***

g3w3jc_LMT,LMT,Did I analyze this position correctly? (Potential outcome of assignment on a SPY spread),"Hello. I'd like to analyze the position I'm in more closely and was hoping someone could check my notes.

---

On 4/14/20 I bought this double diagonal (which I think is really a double calendar since the strikes are the same):

    BUY +2 DBL DIAG SPY 100 (Weeklys) 27 APR 20/24 APR 20 290/269/290/269 CALL/PUT/CALL/PUT @.86 LMT CBOE [TO OPEN/TO OPEN/TO OPEN/TO OPEN]

If can also be viewed as two calendars which might be a bit simpler to parse:

    BUY +2 CALENDAR SPY 100 (Weeklys) 27 APR 20/24 APR 20 269 PUT
    BUY +2 CALENDAR SPY 100 (Weeklys) 27 APR 20/24 APR 20 290 CALL

Or similar to two put and call vertical spreads, but with zero strike difference and added time displacement:

    BUY +2 1/-1 CUSTOM SPY 100 (Weeklys) 27 APR 20/24 APR 20 269/269 PUT/PUT
    BUY +2 1/-1 CUSTOM SPY 100 (Weeklys) 27 APR 20/24 APR 20 290/290 CALL/CALL

Or as selling a strangle and buying one expiring at a later time:

    SELL -2 STRANGLE SPY 100 (Weeklys) 24 APR 20 290/269 CALL/PUT
    BUY +2 STRANGLE SPY 100 (Weeklys) 27 APR 20 290/269 CALL/PUT

---

My current position has a [P/L at expiration diagram that looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/FiisFGC.png) with the shaded region showing likely (1 std dev) movement at EOD Monday.

I am concerned about the possibility of SPY going above my short call at 290 and getting assigned by my broker, so I'd like to weigh my options and ensure I understand the scenarios I may be facing, and I'd like some confirmation that my analysis is correct.

Based on the P/L diagram I believe, assuming price, volatility, pricing, etc remains the same (ie, unrealistically), that I have, on Monday by EOD,

- A 11.14% + 15.86% = 27% chance of SPY going above my 290 call, thus putting me at elevated assignment risk
- A 15.81% + 34.63% + 22.5% = 72.94% chance of SPY staying above my 269 put and below my 290 call, keeping me at minimal assignment risk
- A 0.06% chance of SPY falling below my 269 put

That said, ToS shows my breakeven value is still positive above my 290 short/long call, and I'd like to examine that more closely.

---

I seem to have the following basic choices:

- Sell immediately on Monday morning, near the current prices, and claim some profit.
- Wait until after first expiration, i.e. after APR 24, and assuming the price stayed in range, claim a larger profit (or loss, if it's in the exact middle) by selling back the long call/puts.
- Hold until after first expiration, i.e. after APR 24, and hope the price jumps past my range and profit from the resulting strangle position (or lose, if it doesn't)
- Allow the position to hold until APR 24 and sell then. This comes with an elevated risk of assignment as there is a 27% chance of SPY being above my call of 290 on Monday.

---

Looking closer at that last choice I'd like to examine the assignment scenarios:

- In the best case SPY doesn't go out of range and I don't get assigned. See above choices.
- In a less good case SPY goes above 290 temporarily, I don't get assigned, and it comes back down to stay in range. See above choices.
- In another case SPY goes to (say) 291 and I am assigned. Now what?

Assuming SPY is as 291 and I am assigned this puts me into one of the following positions (I don't know which):

- A new position of holding the calendar put spread at 269, one call at 290, -200 shares of SPY, and -$40 or so for assignment commission.
- A new position of holding the calendar put spread at 269, -$40 or so for assignment commission, -$40 or so for exercise commission, and -$58k or so to cover assignment. (ie: the broker automatically used my long 290 call to offset this short 290 call)
- A new position of holding nothing (broker closed entire double diagonal) and -58k or so.

To expand on the first option, to rectify my short I can then do one of:

- Spend $58,200 of buying power to purchase 200 shares of SPY at $291 to cancel out my obligation.
- Spend $58,000 of buying power to exercise my 290 calls to obtain 200 shares of SPY at $290 to cancel out my obligation, plus lose $20 for exercise commission.


After covering the short I'm now out ~58k or so (assuming I did not previously have any SPY stock).

At this point I then have the position of the calendar put spread at 269, (potentially) one call at 290, and a loss of ~ 58k.

(edit) I could then sell the 290 call to obtain ~ $868 (varies based on current option price), which would not change the magnitude much.

Alternately the latter two options are essentially automatic versions of the above, correct?

---

Assuming I've analyzed these choices correctly, since I would prefer not to be assigned, I should probably close this position if SPY spikes up.

Since I've decided on that, I now have the following choices:
- Sell immediately at open on Monday
- Watch SPY on Monday, manually sell if it approaches a strike,
- Enter a closing market order triggered by SPY price approaching the strikes.

Have I analyzed this correctly? Thank you!



-----
(edit)
Thinking about this further, I did not analyze the position correctly. I had missed that I'd have a temporary gain of $58k from when I sold the shares at 290 I did not have.

That changes things a bit:

Assuming SPY is as 291 and I am assigned this puts me into one of the following positions (I don't know which):

- A new position of holding the calendar put spread at 269, one call at 290, -200 shares of SPY, +58k from the assignment of the call, and -$40 or so for assignment commission.
- A new position of holding the calendar put spread at 269, -$40 or so for assignment commission, -$40 or so for exercise commission, -$200 from the sale and purchase of SPY at 290/291, and -$40 or so for assignment commission. (ie: the broker automatically used my long 290 call to offset this short 290 call)
- A new position of holding nothing (broker closed entire double diagonal) and -$200 or so, and -$80 for two exercises and two assignments.

To expand on the first option, to rectify my short I can then do one of:

- Spend $58,200 of buying power to purchase 200 shares of SPY at $291 to cancel out my obligation.
- Spend $58,000 of buying power to exercise my 290 calls to obtain 200 shares of SPY at $290 to cancel out my obligation, plus lose $20 for exercise commission.

After covering the short I'm now out ~$200 or so (difference between the 290/291 call spread).

How does the broker decide to exercise my long 290 call or not? What about the 269 calendar spread as part of the double calendar?

---

Additionally, there is another risk: If I am assigned and gain $58k and -200 shares, and the price then drops before my long call is executed, I then potentially can lose the difference between current SPY value and my 290 call if I exercise it. Eg:

- SPY spikes to 291, I'm assigned
- SPY drops to 288 without my 290 call being exercised.
- I can cover my -200 shares now my exercising the call, but I'll lose an additional 2\*2\*$100, or $400 in doing so.
- The upside, though, is SPY could go to 291, I could get assigned, and then SPY could go to 293 and I'd gain $400 in doing so, assuming I have enough BP or margin to cover me.",2020-04-18,1,7

fmvkkh_F,F,Covered strangle with SPY M/W/F weeklies,"6-year of stock trading/investing but fairly new to options, so thank you all in advance for your help.

For the past few weeks i've tried learning the fundamentals on options and exploring strategies for generating consistent income in a conservative way. The strategy I wanted to ask about here was  weekly covered strangles on the SPY 3x per week (M, W, F), or in other words, a covered call with a cash secured put, to capitalize on the current premiums albeit still small given the 1 day expirations.

Given the historic crash we've experienced and may continue to, I intend on scaling into a longer-term SPY position with capital to deploy further. I purchased some SPY last Friday as part of my first entry. What I thought about doing now was selling M, W, and F calls and puts every week, with the calls at +5% OTM, and the puts around -15% OTM. Both the calls and puts show a 95+% probability of expiring worthless on a consistent basis, and If I get trapped into a -15%+ (unlikely given circuit breakers, historical moves, etc) to the downside, I'm happy with bagholding another 100 shares of SPY at a time potentially a handful of times into further downside. At this point we're down almost 40% in a month and as catastrophic as people are making these circumstances out to be, it seems like a decent scaling entry point for the longer term. The weekly covered strangles + dividends would also help cost basis. My goal is to begin with 100 shares and accumulate up to 500 this year.

Quick math shows that this could generate 2-3% ROC per week (credit of about $300 selling 1 call, 1 put), and I realize I could be dead wrong and be missing something, so please advise if I am.

Check your SPY short calls, and consider rolling them out in time,  
 or closing them today, Thursday,  March 19.  
Trading ends at 4:15 PM Eastern US time for SPY. 

If the call's  **extrinsic** value is less than the estimated dividend of around $1.30; extrinsic value of less than that makes the position vulnerable to dividend arbitrage, and early assignment, and dividend liability if you are stuck with short stock.

Is it worth the higher premiums to go out further on SPY given most of us assume that it will go back down or look shorter term like I usually do assuming this is the natural cycle of value investors re-entering at current discounted prices relative to valuation, and the market will not see more than one Green Day at a time right now?",2020-03-17,0,17

fjar07_MA,MA,$SPY Technical Analysis – Very Bearish $244p 3/20 & $225p 4/3,"For the Retards: The fed cut the rate and futures still bombed 1000 points. There’s no supports after 242. The bottom has fallen out on SPY and tbh I have no idea where it stops but I’m sure it’s going down.

Ticker: $SPY

Intervals: 1W, 1D, 1H

Indicators: Aroon, RSI, MA(200 & 50), ATR, NetVolume, News Catalysts

Signals: 1W Aroon Signal Bearish, NetVolume Overwhelmingly Bearish, Under 200 & 50 MA Bearish  
 Position: Short Term $244p 3/20 & Long Term $225p 4/3 

Targets: Take most of your profit at 243 and let some of your puts ride when it dips under.

News: “Stock futures plunged Sunday night even after the Federal Reserve embarked on a massive monetary stimulus campaign to curb slower economic growth amid the coronavirus outbreak. While the central bank’s actions may help ease the functioning of markets, many investors said they would ultimately want to see coronavirus cases peaking and falling in the U.S. before it was safe to take on risk and buy equities again.

Stock market futures hit “limit down” levels of 5% lower, a move made by the CME futures exchange to reduce panic in markets. No prices can trade below that threshold, only at higher prices than that down 5% limit.,"" (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/traders-await-futures-open-after-fed-cuts-rates-launches-easing-program.html)  
 

TLDR; The fed cut rates to zero and futures still bombed.   
 

Analysis: 1W and daily signals have not changed significantly since my last analysis. 1W & 1D aroon still giving sell signals. Net Volume is -1.5G signaling overwhelming bearish investor sentiment. Volumetric support/resistance plotting give weak support around $243 and almost no accumulation thereafter until $200

Bought 35k worth just before Donnie announced his press conference. Doubled down, then doubled down again, then doubled that. Averaged from 7ish down to 4ish. Still down $100,000 at close. 

This is the money I got from insurance paying me for all my possessions after my house burnt down. (Check post history.) So I'm basically trying for a reverse fire sale thing here.

Gold at $1563 an oz (up around 20% over the past year, 50% in the last 4 years).","40% is the average, but if you have your own picks of quality companies you’re up anywhere from 60-100%. The correction in gold is over and we are well on our way into the new bull market. The gold stocks don’t get much coverage, but they’ve been the best performing sector and will continue to do so. 

The federal reserve has injected over 500 billion into the repo markets; if you take a look at a chart you can see spikes of green directly corresponding with the amount of liquidity injected. We’re well into QE 4, it’s laughable that the fed won’t call it that; but if they did they would be admitting to debt monetization. Who gives a fuck what they say, care about what they do. They flip flopped on monetary policy last winter, rates going back to 0. Its honestly fucked up how they teach monetary policy and inflation to children. Scumbags would rather see the stock market up in nominal terms, than actually do their jobs and not get involved. 

We’re headed right into a currency crisis. Surprisingly gold has gone up before the drop in the dollar has even started; shows just how weak the dollar is, and how the risk premiums are starting to be built in. 

Now I don’t expect the public/general investors to hop into gold until it is well over $2000 an oz. Increasing demand has come from central banks globally, they’ve been buying large amounts of gold and selling off US treasuries. Some people will take advantage of this undervalued asset and buy while it’s cheap; most will be deterred from the stigma. 

A lot of people will get caught up in the passive investing scheme. General investors WILL ride this market all the way down. Out of greed they won’t sell, they’d rather lock up their money for years while waiting for it to come back.",2020-01-11,267,129

I don't quite understand the skepticism myself, given the nominal growth rate of the S&P 500 since 2007 and the OP's disciplined approach to reducing expenses and putting every spare penny into his investment, but just to make sure I wasn't kidding myself, here's [a Monte Carlo sim](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation?s=y&fullHistory=true&adjustmentType=1&smoothingRate=75&historicalVolatility=true&volatility=12.0&symbol1=SPY&endYear=2018&years=12&frequency=2&mode=2&inflationAdjusted=true&inflationVolatility=3.0&sequenceStressTest=2&inflationMean=4.0&startYear=2007&bootstrapModel=1&inflationModel=1&customIntervals=false&adjustmentPercentage=4.0&dof=30&adjustmentAmount=2500&allocation1_1=100&circularBootstrap=true&simulationModel=1&distribution=1&currentAge=70&bootstrapMaxYears=20&historicalCorrelations=true&returnList=0%2C+2.5%2C+5%2C+7.5%2C+10%2C+12.5&lifeExpectancyModel=0&bootstrapMinYears=1&meanReturn=7.0&percentileList=10%2C+25%2C+50%2C+75%2C+90&rollingAveragePeriods=3&initialAmount=1000) I set up with similar parameters to that thread. I can't make it identical -- for one thing, I don't know all the details of OP's investment history -- but using some reasonable assumptions based on what was written, here's what I come up with.

**50th percentile outcome: $1,004,384 (nominal)**

Ignore the ""5 years"" that the UI shows. I had to hack the URL for the sim to get it to do exactly 12 years. You can inspect the hack yourself by examining the [URL](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation?s=y&fullHistory=true&adjustmentType=1&smoothingRate=75&historicalVolatility=true&volatility=12.0&symbol1=SPY&endYear=2018&years=12&frequency=2&mode=2&inflationAdjusted=true&inflationVolatility=3.0&sequenceStressTest=2&inflationMean=4.0&startYear=2007&bootstrapModel=1&inflationModel=1&customIntervals=false&adjustmentPercentage=4.0&dof=30&adjustmentAmount=2500&allocation1_1=100&circularBootstrap=true&simulationModel=1&distribution=1&currentAge=70&bootstrapMaxYears=20&historicalCorrelations=true&returnList=0%2C+2.5%2C+5%2C+7.5%2C+10%2C+12.5&lifeExpectancyModel=0&bootstrapMinYears=1&meanReturn=7.0&percentileList=10%2C+25%2C+50%2C+75%2C+90&rollingAveragePeriods=3&initialAmount=1000).

Assumptions:

* 12 years

* Use historical data starting from 2007 (full data available only through 2018)

* Average of $2500/month contribution to SPY

* First two years forced to be the worst years, to simulate the GFC of 2008

Even if I [remove the 2007 starting date and let the sim pull from the full history of SPY data](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation?s=y&fullHistory=true&adjustmentType=1&smoothingRate=75&historicalVolatility=true&volatility=12.0&symbol1=SPY&endYear=2018&years=12&frequency=2&mode=2&inflationAdjusted=true&inflationVolatility=3.0&sequenceStressTest=2&inflationMean=4.0&startYear=1972&bootstrapModel=1&inflationModel=1&customIntervals=false&adjustmentPercentage=4.0&dof=30&adjustmentAmount=2500&allocation1_1=100&circularBootstrap=true&simulationModel=1&distribution=1&currentAge=70&bootstrapMaxYears=20&historicalCorrelations=true&returnList=0%2C+2.5%2C+5%2C+7.5%2C+10%2C+12.5&lifeExpectancyModel=0&bootstrapMinYears=1&meanReturn=7.0&percentileList=10%2C+25%2C+50%2C+75%2C+90&rollingAveragePeriods=3&initialAmount=1000), the 50% percentile outcome is still in the ballpark: $995,998.

This is to say nothing of the top half of outcomes that are well above $1MM. For the lower half, the 10th percentile case was in the region of $646K, which is still a nice chunk of change.

TL;DR - $1MM was achievable in the last 12 years, sticking $2500/month into SPY.",2019-11-17,501,258

As one looking positively in the future (I don't see the point of investing if you're thinking otherwise), I really feel like tech is bound to overtake ever increasing share of world economy. This will ensure that tech will experience a much stronger and more sustainable growth than overall market. 
This leads me to the thought that a young investor with really long time horizon should prefer investing in NASDAQ companies to SPY.
Would like to hear your thoughts in this regard!)

bhy686_SPY,SPY,Pricing model for short-term SPY options,"Hi guys.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to find a model that estimates somewhat reliably short-term (2-3 days) option prices for the SPY based on VIX and risk-free (actually 3-month treasury bond yield rate) interest rates. This is for back-testing purposes. To better define the problem:

*Given any trading day in the last 20-30 years of the SPY, what was the index price (obtained from historical data) and the prices of the options that expire within 2-3 days of the given day and have a strike price close to ATM?*

&#x200B;

Naively, I tried to use the black-scholes model and expected to get some prices that deviate from the real prices with reasonable amounts (e.g. 30-50% off). Of course, trying to match the model with real-world data I found out the model can be really far off. For example:

&#x200B;

|Date/time|SPY price|Expiry|Strike|Real option price|Black-scholes|VIX|rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019-04-25 13:50:09.000|292.47|2019-04-26|295C|0.0407|0.561|12.97|2.43%|

&#x200B;

Now, there are of course a lot of assumptions that are made that probably make Black-scholes inappropriate for this kind of estimation (american vs european, etc.).  Also, afaik, VIX represents weighted averages of 30-day option chains, etc.

&#x200B;

Also, I'm aware that there is historical data for these options, but it doesn't cover the whole period (afaik, weekly and sub-weekly options weren't around in the 90s).

&#x200B;

Any help, criticism or input is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",2019-04-27,25,16

b8u2r2_PEP,PEP,How to destroy SPY using leverage and top global consumer brands,"While both, risk parity and individual ownership of businesses can be viable techniques to building wealth, why not use a combination of the two given the evidence?  We all realize how difficult it is to beat SPY on a consistent basis, as even the GOAT himself, Warren Buffett, has gone on record countless times to endorse ETF's such as SPY vs. individual stock picking.

Here is a simple allocation that includes 4 securities:  

**50.0% SSO**

**25.0% AGG**

**12.5% KO**

**12.5% MCD**

The math behind this allocation works out to a total of 150% leverage: 

* 125% equity exposure and 25% fixed income exposure 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/gDNLYXP) are the results dating back to the inception of SSO:

Out of 13 years of data (including the unfinished calendar year of 2019), the allocation beat SPY in 12 of the 13.  The single year of underperformance was 2018 with a drawdown of -5.65% vs. SPY drawdown of -4.52%.  The allocation outperformed SPY during the financial crisis years, as well as during opposite heated bull market years like 2013.  An overall CAGR of 11.21% vs. 7.96% for that of SPY.  Further, a higher sharpe for the leveraged allocation, and a similar max drawdown to that of SPY.  Take a look at [the data](https://imgur.com/a/IZAfXfT) yourself.  

And [here is the chart](https://imgur.com/a/eolmPZs) as a visual representation of the outperformance.  

I chose KO and MCD as the individual securities, as these are among the [top global consumer brands](https://www.rankingthebrands.com/The-Brand-Rankings.aspx?rankingID=334&year=1217) according to Forbes dating back multiple decades.  One could likely replace these securities with PG, and/or PEP for example, but I prefer the former given the consistently high rankings as top tier global brands.  The idea is to choose consumer brands that will act as bond substitutes during equity drawdowns, thus minimizing the allocation drawdown and creating a better sharpe over long periods of time, and to choose brands whose products/services will almost certainly be directly linked to inflation.  Both KO and MCD offer these types of products and routinely act as some of the best securities to own during large equity drawdowns, for reasons that are probably more obvious than not.

Risk parity and owning strong consumer brands (tilted towards consumer staples) are both great forms of building wealth, but why not combine the two?  While several money managers and hedge fund gurus will spend countless hours trying to beat SPY with limited annual success, a simple and proven method using leverage, strong brands and an annual rebalancing mechanism will likely destroy the pros with minimal effort.  

*as a side-note, the daily re-setting of SSO is actually a tailwind vs. what most assume to be a headwind for the leveraged product.  That is, during both 2008 and 2013, SSO actually outperformed what should have been a -74% drawdown and +64% gain given SPY's total annual return each year.  SSO certainly suffered a large drawdown in 2008, but it was less than 2x SPY, and it outperformed on the upside, greater than 2x SPY in 2013.* ",2019-04-03,5,21
b0466g_CRM,CRM,SPY deep ITM option vs DITM CRM... why is SPY so much better?,"SPY: 

trades at $287.5

2 year calls @140 are 138.7 

Now, lets assume SPY goes up 15% to 330.625

These make the calls cost $13,870 (plus the 4% in lost divs make the calls cost $15,250- I'm using 4% of 330.62 as the lost divs, thereby highballing)

The cost to exercise is 14K+15,250, and the profit is $3870.

If I had instead put that $15,250 into stocks (rounded down), I'd have bought 52 stocks and made $2242. 

The difference between DITM leverage and stocks is 72.57% or $1627


CRM:

trades at $157.65

Now, lets assume CRM goes up 15% to 181

21mo calls @80 are $84.15 *so $8415) if i take the middle of the bid/ask per the calculator online. The interest here is a mere 2.63%, or 4% when compared to just buying 100 stocks.

The cost to exercise is 8415+8000 is  $16,415, and the profit is $1714.75

If I had instead put 8415 into 53 stocks, the profit would be $1253.31. 

The difference between the DITM and the stocks is 36.8%, or $461.43



Why is SPY so much more profitable as leverage? Obviously the spread is more favorable, but you lose 4% on SPY divs... the CRM interest is less than the divs alone....?

In order to the crm option to match SPY's leverage difference at 15%, crm needs to go up 50%, and to match SPY's profit, it has to go up 20% (assuming i buy 2 crm contracts instead of 1 spy, since its roughly half the price.) 

Where is my math wrong? or what's the logic I'm oblivious to? I like crm, but I don't know that I'm confident enough that it'll out-average the market by over 5% to breakeven + whatever % makes it worth the risk. ",2019-03-12,2,4

This is “show me the money” system when only trading a $10K account.

Stocks or ETFs or options are selected the night before and bought at the market on the next day’s open. They are monitored on a 5-minute chart (see chart) with a stop-loss on any close below the day’s open after the first five minutes. If a stock or ETF or option does not stop out right away, it will immediately be in profits. If the ETF or stock or option does not violate its open any time during the day the profits can be taken on the close to end of market day. That is the basic trade.

An alternative trade is to buy after the market open in the direction of the market trends whenever any ETF, stock, option is above its open, and manage it the same as above. The market trends are for the three time frames based on market timing – a Day, a Swing and a Rally trend for the longer term.

Profits can be taken at any time when the ETF, stock, option is overbought, or when it breaks down through a fast falling moving average. And as a day trade the trade ends on the close no matter what.

1fu1ti_MS,MS,100 milliseconds of SPY trade and quote activity around Chicago PMI News Release (9:42),"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9JBm51Zj3U&feature=youtu.be


This video shows 1/10th of a second of SPY trading when PMI was released. The different boxes represent the different exchanges and A=ask, B=bid and T=last trade. The lines between the boxes represent the links between the exchanges and each colored icon represents a quote being transmitted between exchanges. 

Keep in mind that this entire video is only 0.1 seconds of trading. Another thing: CME and NASDAQ have launched a wireless network joint venture which will use radio signals to beam quotes between Chicago and NY in about 8.5 ms.
