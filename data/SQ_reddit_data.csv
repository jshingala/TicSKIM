1jam8g5_PATH,PATH,Idaho Lawmakers Introduce Cannabis Legalization Bill Days After Passing Resolution to Block Voters’ Powers,">An Idaho lawmaker who voted in favor of a resolution on March 5 to strip voters’ powers to legalize cannabis via the initiative process now wants to do it himself.

>State Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, introduced bipartisan legislation on March 12, [House Bill 401](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/H0401/), to legalize medical cannabis in the Gem State. He’s sponsoring the bipartisan legislation, the Sgt. Kitzhaber Medical Cannabis Act, alongside Rep. Ilana Rubel, D-Boise.

>The bill aims to allow qualified patients 21 years and older to obtain medical cannabis from licensed medical cannabis pharmacies and possess up to 60 grams (roughly 2 ounces) of cannabis flower capped at 22% THC or 4,000 milligrams of THC in processed products by Jan. 1, 2026. The bill would make an exception to allow for up to 20,000 milligrams of THC for terminally ill, hospice or cancer patients.

>H.B. 401 would also reschedule THC, or its synthetic equivalents, from Schedule I to a Schedule II controlled substance under the Idaho code. In addition, it would legalize the transportation of medical cannabis.

>More specifically, a fiscal note attached to the bill states, “No growing, selling or production of cannabis in Idaho would be permitted under this legislation.”

>According to the bill’s language, Idaho’s Board of Pharmacy would be required to establish rules “for the importation of cannabis, cannabis products, and medical cannabis devices into this state,” which directly collides with federal law banning the interstate commerce of cannabis—medical or not.

>The bill’s introduction came one week after House lawmakers voted, 58-10, to pass [House Joint Resolution 4](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/HJR004/) to put a constitutional question before voters in 2026, asking them to surrender their “power and authority” to legalize cannabis or other psychoactive substances via the ballot initiative process. The Senate passed the resolution in a 29-6 vote on March 12, ensuring that the state will pay up to $200,000 to put a constitutional amendment on next year’s ballot.

>Although Redman was one of the 58 House members who voted in favor of passing the resolution last week, Rebel, who serves as the Democratic minority leader in the lower chamber, opposed its passage.

>“All that this [resolution] does is it’s stripping the power of the people, should the people of Idaho ever reach that level where they are so desperate to get medical cannabis legalized that they are willing to leap through the astonishing hurdles that have already been set in their path for a ballot initiative,” Rubel said on the House floor.

>In 2021, Rubel sponsored a previous version of the Sgt. Jeremy Kitzhaber Medical Cannabis Act, which is named after a 22-year U.S. Air Force veteran with stage 4 terminal cancer who spoke in favor of the legislation four years ago. During his service, he was exposed to radiation and other biological and chemical hazards...

>“I didn’t even think about medical cannabis as an option until my doctors started saying that they would prescribe it to me if I didn’t live in Idaho—if I wasn’t in a state where it was illegal— because I was so thin, and I had so much trouble eating while on chemo that I was actually starving to death.”

>Kitzhaber made a “brutally painful” recovery only to fail chemo and have the cancer come back, resulting in a second surgery to have it all done again. He was placed on several opioids.

>Despite Kitzhaber’s testimony, the Idaho House Health and Welfare Committee never gave the 2021 legislation a full hearing.

>In 2025, Redman’s sponsorship of the latest Sgt. Kitzhaber Medical Cannabis Act (H.B. 401) is a head-scratcher on its surface. The Republican lawmaker also sponsored H.B. 7 earlier this session, which backpedals on reform by mandating a $300 minimum fine for possessing up to 3 ounces of cannabis in Idaho. Gov. Brad Little signed the bill on Feb. 24. It becomes effective July 1.

>At a public hearing for the bill in January, Redmen said, “We do not want this to become a marijuana state.”

>However, Redman also indicated in January that perhaps it’s time for the state Legislature to consider medical cannabis legalization.

>“We heard some extremely compelling arguments in testimony today that dealt with the use of medicinal marijuana, and honestly, maybe that’s a conversation that this body should have … for some folks that are dealing with some extremely tough issues,” Redman said after the hearing.

>Kitzhaber testified at the hearing to oppose H.B. 7 in January.

>“Somebody under chemotherapy that’s almost starving to death shouldn’t get the $300 fine just like somebody else who wanted to get high,” he said.

>While that testimony did not deter Redman from standing behind his bill that will become effective later this year, Redmen’s introduction of H.B. 401 this week indicates he agrees with Kitzhaber: Medical cannabis patients wouldn’t be fined or criminalized for possessing up to 2 ounces under Redman’s latest bill. However, smoking medical cannabis in public or public view would be prohibited, as would home cultivation.

>Under H.B. 401, there would be 16 qualifying conditions, such as AIDS/HIV, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder or other debilitating medical conditions as determined by a practitioner.

>Also under the legislation, medical cannabis products would need to be in measured dosage form in blister-seal or tamper-evident packaging that indicates the amount of THC and CBD contained.

>Idaho remains one of eight states that has not legalized a medical cannabis program, even a highly restrictive one like in Texas, where THC is capped at 1%.",2025-03-13,42,2
1ih4fq6_PYPL,PYPL,Block (XYZ) seems very undervalued - Long Term Buy,"Purchased SQ (now XYZ) originally in Nov.2021 for a cool price of $187 (moron ik). Waited roughly a year and a half and quadrupled down at $45ish and now at a cost basis of $77.

Here's why I think it's a good value among high-growth equities on surface level.

1. Forward P/E of 19.53 --> Historically valued at significantly elevated multiples compared to today \[and that's with significantly less revenue than 3 years ago\] --> Ballparking it: A best in breed company with minimal legacy tech overhang IMO should be valued near 25x FWD earnings. Five Year Forward Multiple is roughly 100! The counter argument is that compared to the Financial Sector Multiple of 12x \[think big banks\] it's overvalued. At the end of the day, if people were willing to pay so much more for a company years ago when they had no clear path to profitability, this strikes me as the next castle of glass that Crypto enthusiasts will rally around \[even though their core valuation actually hinges on other aspects of their ecosystem\]. Intrinsic Value \~guesstimate is $130. Best case scenario with a simple ballpark DCF at an 8% discount rate and 2.5% terminal growth rate the value comes out in the $160s.
2. PEG of 0.15 --> Cash App is becoming a money machine that generates a significant portion of their revenues from Transaction Fees and through their lending ecosystem (Afterpay, Cash App Borrow, Square Loans). ROIC from all 3 were above 20% and 30% for both Afterpay and Cash App Borrow.
3. In the last 5 years: Operating income is up 1000%, 5 Year Revenue Growth of 450%, GPV has Skyrocketed.

Overall, I am very bullish on this in the long term \[5 years\] and believe it's a great value in a tech space that seemingly gets more expensive every day. I will continue to DCA this company through dips.

Risks:

1. Cathy Wood owns it xD
2. Competition - People can argue that AAPL, GOOGL, PYPL, or Zelle can eat their lunch. Frankly speaking this is fair. However, I believe Cash App has an ecosystem that entrenches lower income individuals who are more likely to take out higher interest loans through Cash App versus a traditional bank or a tech company who wouldn't lend out $ to them because they simply aren't qualified.

2b. This poses another risk where lower Socioeconomic status people can't afford to pay back the loans offered by Cash App. Big Finance made a killing over past decades by preying on poor people who simply couldn't pay back anything but their interest knowing they would default. In my eyes, in a world filled with evil and greedy players: Cash App at least doesn't charge people a fucking monthly minimum balance fee to rob them.

3. Crypto - Double Edged Sword --> Frankly speaking, I've been long on BTC since 2019. Unfortunately, we're entering an era of pump and dump on an institutional level. Now, granted I think Jack is smart and will play this BTC bubble well. Time will tell. Ultimately, if other people keep buying crypto - cash app will continue to print money in fees.

1i3r3v5_SQ,SQ,Betting $1M on BLOCK ($SQ) as a bitcoin mining play ,"Jack Dorsey (dad) is the second biggest bitcoin dick rider after Saylor. The problem with Jack is that he's a low key CEO that doesn't like to be in the public eye and therefore sucks at pumping his own stock. This is where we come in. Time to shed some light on how undervalued BLOCK is. 

https://preview.redd.it/0jey95tnemde1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fade12885ceee25efd9999c9b81868c4b9fb794

First, Block is becoming a player in the bitcoin mining space. They are developing their own chip/rig with Proto. Proto is a suite of bitcoin mining products and services designed to help decentralize the global supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. Proto works to increase builder access to bitcoin mining chips and rigs while increasing network resiliency and making everyday use of bitcoin secure and simple.

Block also has \~8,211 BTC valued at \~$862M.

TRUMP loves crypto and has recently stated he plans to designate Cryptocurrency as a National Priority. He will enact pro-crypto executive orders on day 1 (that's why BTC is mooning right now). He also stated he wants all bitcoin mining to be done in America.

Second, here is a graph of BLOCK's revenue growth vs share price (self-explanatory).

Not sure how this hasn't caught on as a bitcoin play when all these other shitco's that do bitcoin mining or just have BTC on their balance sheet have absolutely rocketed in the past 4 months. When the hype catches up, we should see some explosive moves up to $100+.

# Biden Blocks $14 billion Acquisition Of US Steel By Japan’s Nippon Steel

In a move straight out of a geopolitical drama, President Biden hit the brakes on Nippon Steel’s $14.1 billion bid for US Steel, claiming the deal posed a ""credible threat"" to national security. The decision followed a recommendation (or lack thereof) from the CFIUS, which punted the call to the White House after failing to reach a consensus.

**A Steel Defense**  
  
Biden framed the decision as a win for American resilience, calling US Steel essential to critical supply chains, infrastructure, and national defense. His statement didn’t hold back, stressing that US Steel needs to stay “American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers.” The United Steelworkers union cheered the announcement, while Nippon Steel and US Steel cried foul, calling the move political theater.

**Boardroom vs. Courtroom**  
  
The drama isn’t over. Nippon Steel and US Steel plan to take their fight to court, accusing Biden of prioritizing union optics over economic sense. The failed bid leaves US Steel’s future uncertain—it may have to restart the sale process or go solo after years of financial challenges. Meanwhile, Cleveland-Cliffs, an earlier bidder, could circle back, but even that’s murky now.

**Tariffs and Trade Tensions**  
  
This decision doesn’t just shake Wall Street; it could strain ties between the US and Japan. Nippon Steel’s leadership, already frustrated with Biden’s stance, hinted that the ruling sends a “chilling message” to international investors. With Trump’s return looming and his history of tariff love on deck, the US steel sector may be facing a new era of protectionism—again.

For US Steel, surviving alone might be tough. For investors, it’s an open question: What’s next in the battle for America’s industrial crown?

# Microsoft’s $80 Billion AI Bet, Building the Future of Cloud Computing

Microsoft is making waves with a massive $80 billion investment in AI-focused data centers this fiscal year. More than half of the funds will be spent in the U.S., aiming to bolster the company’s infrastructure for handling skyrocketing AI demand. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, made the announcement in a blog post emphasizing the importance of private-sector innovation and warning against ""heavy-handed regulations"" under the incoming Trump administration.

**The AI Arms Race**  
  
Big tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, are in a race to dominate AI computing capacity. Microsoft’s spending spree is largely tied to its partnership with OpenAI and its drive to incorporate AI across its products. In just the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Microsoft shelled out $20 billion in capital expenditures, primarily on data centers packed with Nvidia GPUs—the gold standard for AI workloads. The goal? To stay ahead of global competitors, particularly China, which has been wooing developing nations with subsidized AI infrastructure.

**Powering AI with Nuclear Deals**  
  
High-powered data centers require immense energy, and Microsoft’s solution involves nuclear power deals—including an agreement to reopen the infamous Three Mile Island reactor. The company isn’t alone—Amazon and Google have signed similar deals as they expand their cloud capabilities.

**A Policy Pitch**  
  
Smith’s message wasn’t just about numbers; it was also a call to action. He urged the Trump administration to adopt policies that support AI growth through education, targeted export controls, and global promotion of U.S. AI technologies. The concern is clear: China’s growing influence in the AI space could shape the future of global tech ecosystems, with Smith advocating for the U.S. to lead not by complaint, but by action.

As AI reshapes industries, Microsoft’s investment signals that the future of cloud computing will hinge on who can build the fastest, most powerful infrastructure. The $80 billion question is whether this arms race will yield the AI dominance Microsoft is betting on.

Next week was shaping up to be the first full grind of 2025—until President Biden declared January 9 a national day of mourning for President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at 100 on December 29. That means the stock market will take a breather, while the bond market shuts down at 2 p.m. ET.

# Biden Blocks $14 billion Acquisition Of US Steel By Japan’s Nippon Steel

In a move straight out of a geopolitical drama, President Biden hit the brakes on Nippon Steel’s $14.1 billion bid for US Steel, claiming the deal posed a ""credible threat"" to national security. The decision followed a recommendation (or lack thereof) from the CFIUS, which punted the call to the White House after failing to reach a consensus.

**A Steel Defense**  
  
Biden framed the decision as a win for American resilience, calling US Steel essential to critical supply chains, infrastructure, and national defense. His statement didn’t hold back, stressing that US Steel needs to stay “American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers.” The United Steelworkers union cheered the announcement, while Nippon Steel and US Steel cried foul, calling the move political theater.

**Boardroom vs. Courtroom**  
  
The drama isn’t over. Nippon Steel and US Steel plan to take their fight to court, accusing Biden of prioritizing union optics over economic sense. The failed bid leaves US Steel’s future uncertain—it may have to restart the sale process or go solo after years of financial challenges. Meanwhile, Cleveland-Cliffs, an earlier bidder, could circle back, but even that’s murky now.

**Tariffs and Trade Tensions**  
  
This decision doesn’t just shake Wall Street; it could strain ties between the US and Japan. Nippon Steel’s leadership, already frustrated with Biden’s stance, hinted that the ruling sends a “chilling message” to international investors. With Trump’s return looming and his history of tariff love on deck, the US steel sector may be facing a new era of protectionism—again.

For US Steel, surviving alone might be tough. For investors, it’s an open question: What’s next in the battle for America’s industrial crown?

# Microsoft’s $80 Billion AI Bet, Building the Future of Cloud Computing

Microsoft is making waves with a massive $80 billion investment in AI-focused data centers this fiscal year. More than half of the funds will be spent in the U.S., aiming to bolster the company’s infrastructure for handling skyrocketing AI demand. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, made the announcement in a blog post emphasizing the importance of private-sector innovation and warning against ""heavy-handed regulations"" under the incoming Trump administration.

# Biden Blocks $14 billion Acquisition Of US Steel By Japan’s Nippon Steel

In a move straight out of a geopolitical drama, President Biden hit the brakes on Nippon Steel’s $14.1 billion bid for US Steel, claiming the deal posed a ""credible threat"" to national security. The decision followed a recommendation (or lack thereof) from the CFIUS, which punted the call to the White House after failing to reach a consensus.

**A Steel Defense**  
  
Biden framed the decision as a win for American resilience, calling US Steel essential to critical supply chains, infrastructure, and national defense. His statement didn’t hold back, stressing that US Steel needs to stay “American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers.” The United Steelworkers union cheered the announcement, while Nippon Steel and US Steel cried foul, calling the move political theater.

**Boardroom vs. Courtroom**  
  
The drama isn’t over. Nippon Steel and US Steel plan to take their fight to court, accusing Biden of prioritizing union optics over economic sense. The failed bid leaves US Steel’s future uncertain—it may have to restart the sale process or go solo after years of financial challenges. Meanwhile, Cleveland-Cliffs, an earlier bidder, could circle back, but even that’s murky now.

**Tariffs and Trade Tensions**  
  
This decision doesn’t just shake Wall Street; it could strain ties between the US and Japan. Nippon Steel’s leadership, already frustrated with Biden’s stance, hinted that the ruling sends a “chilling message” to international investors. With Trump’s return looming and his history of tariff love on deck, the US steel sector may be facing a new era of protectionism—again.

For US Steel, surviving alone might be tough. For investors, it’s an open question: What’s next in the battle for America’s industrial crown?

# Microsoft’s $80 Billion AI Bet, Building the Future of Cloud Computing

Microsoft is making waves with a massive $80 billion investment in AI-focused data centers this fiscal year. More than half of the funds will be spent in the U.S., aiming to bolster the company’s infrastructure for handling skyrocketing AI demand. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, made the announcement in a blog post emphasizing the importance of private-sector innovation and warning against ""heavy-handed regulations"" under the incoming Trump administration.

**The AI Arms Race**  
  
Big tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, are in a race to dominate AI computing capacity. Microsoft’s spending spree is largely tied to its partnership with OpenAI and its drive to incorporate AI across its products. In just the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Microsoft shelled out $20 billion in capital expenditures, primarily on data centers packed with Nvidia GPUs—the gold standard for AI workloads. The goal? To stay ahead of global competitors, particularly China, which has been wooing developing nations with subsidized AI infrastructure.

**Powering AI with Nuclear Deals**  
  
High-powered data centers require immense energy, and Microsoft’s solution involves nuclear power deals—including an agreement to reopen the infamous Three Mile Island reactor. The company isn’t alone—Amazon and Google have signed similar deals as they expand their cloud capabilities.

**A Policy Pitch**  
  
Smith’s message wasn’t just about numbers; it was also a call to action. He urged the Trump administration to adopt policies that support AI growth through education, targeted export controls, and global promotion of U.S. AI technologies. The concern is clear: China’s growing influence in the AI space could shape the future of global tech ecosystems, with Smith advocating for the U.S. to lead not by complaint, but by action.

As AI reshapes industries, Microsoft’s investment signals that the future of cloud computing will hinge on who can build the fastest, most powerful infrastructure. The $80 billion question is whether this arms race will yield the AI dominance Microsoft is betting on.

(the ""Company"") (TSX-V: ONE; OTC Pink: OONEF), a pioneer in post-quantum cybersecurity solutions (“PQC”), invites you to attend a virtual presentation by the Company on Wednesday, December 18th at 10:00 AM EST during which the Company will highlight its PQC roadmap and technologies as well as show how they enhance the security of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

>Recent advancements have taken place in quantum computing, such as Google Quantum AI's announcement of their Willow quantum chip, which demonstrates significant improvements in error correction and scalability. (For more information click on Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip). This breakthrough underscores the importance of developing technologies, such as our PQC solutions, that are designed to withstand the computational power of quantum computers.

>Andrew Cheung, CEO of 01 Communique had the following comments. “These recent advancements in quantum computing have reignited the discussion around the safety of traditional encryption. We at 01 Communique have always believed the quantum threat is real, spending the past several years and millions of dollars developing PQC-compliant products. Our technologies have incorporated PQC algorithms endorsed by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as their latest FIPS-203, FIPS-204, and FIPS-205. They have already been integrated into our various applications, including email encryption and remote access solutions that are available on our website. Most importantly, we recognized that cryptocurrencies would be vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers and have been working on a solution since 2022. As a result, we completed a PQC-compliant Solana (SOL) L1 blockchain with expectations of completing commercialization in 2025. We also plan to expand into PQC-compliant AI Machine Learning as well as true end-to-end messaging platform.”

>Andrew Cheung further commented on the Company’s future prospects. “Our PQC-compliant Solana project resulted in us receiving a US Patent (Pat #11,669,833) for a technology invented that can turn any existing cryptocurrency into becoming PQC-compliant. Today it is our belief there is heightened concern around the importance of PQC as well the growing popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. We believe our technology is the ideal solution to be incorporated with cryptocurrencies to help alleviate concerns over the security of cryptocurrencies with respect to quantum computers.”

# ServiceTitan Shares Soar 42% in Blockbuster IPO

The IPO drought may finally be lifting. 

ServiceTitan, a cloud software provider for home and commercial trades, made a blockbuster debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker $TTAN, with shares soaring 42% from their $71 IPO price to close at $101. 

The move gave the Glendale, California-based company a market cap of nearly $9 billion, offering a glimmer of hope for a tech IPO market that’s been in hibernation since 2021.

**From Plumbers to Public Markets**  
  
Founded in 2007 by two sons of tradesmen, ServiceTitan offers software tools to help electricians, plumbers, and landscapers manage scheduling, payments, and customer service. The company serves over 8,000 customers and generated $614 million in revenue for fiscal 2024, up 31% year-over-year, though it still operates at a net loss of $195 million.

The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in the company's growth potential, particularly as demand for its cloud solutions climbs. ServiceTitan’s cloud infrastructure business saw 52% year-over-year growth, cementing its position as a rising star in the tech sector.

**Navigating IPO Challenges**  
  
ServiceTitan’s road to the public markets wasn’t purely strategic—it was partially financial. A prior funding round included steep ""compounding ratchet"" terms, pushing the company to go public to avoid dilution penalties. 

he IPO raised $625 million, with a portion allocated to buy back preferred stock and pay off early investors. Despite the urgency, the IPO’s reception suggests strong market enthusiasm, with retail investors driving early gains.

**What’s Next for IPOs?**  
  
ServiceTitan’s debut isn’t just a win for its founders or venture backers like ICONIQ Growth and Bessemer Venture Partners—it’s a potential green light for other fintech and tech startups waiting in the wings. Analysts see the IPO as a sign that investor appetite for high-growth tech stocks is returning, even amid tighter monetary conditions.

For ServiceTitan, the next chapter includes leveraging its IPO proceeds to fuel growth, pursue acquisitions, and edge closer to profitability. As co-founder and CEO Ara Mahdessian noted, “Investors value durable growth and cash flow positivity—qualities we’re proud to deliver.”

With the Nasdaq Composite closing at record highs and tech giants thriving, ServiceTitan’s IPO success might just be the spark needed to reopen the IPO floodgates.

# Echelon Of Earnings

**⚡️Broadcom Powers Up on AI Hype:** Broadcom’s latest earnings call was an AI lovefest, with the chipmaker reporting a jaw-dropping 220% surge in AI chip revenue, hitting $12.2 billion for the fiscal year. CEO Hock Tan wasn’t shy about the company’s future, forecasting a $90 billion addressable market for AI components by 2027. While the broader semiconductor business is feeling a bit sluggish, AI is doing the heavy lifting.   
  
In Q4 alone, total sales reached nearly $14.1 billion, driven by the booming demand for AI processors and networking chips. Investors cheered, sending the stock up 14% in after-hours trading. Broadcom’s secret sauce? Two new hyperscaler clients and a growing AI infrastructure footprint that keeps it in the same conversation as Nvidia. ($AVGO)

**🤘🏼 Costco Keeps Rolling Despite Consumer Caution:** Turns out, bulk-size everything is recession-proof. Costco smashed Wall Street’s expectations with a $4.04 per share profit last quarter, thanks to its die-hard member base and a strong showing from both food and discretionary sales. Same-store sales jumped 7.1%, and online sales played a starring role in the retailer’s continued growth.   
  
Even as inflation forces some retailers to fight for scraps, Costco’s Kirkland brand and jumbo-sized deals are still luring customers through the doors. Seasonal items like furniture and jewelry are flying off the shelves, while food and groceries continue to edge out dining out. Investors liked what they saw—Costco’s stock is up 50% year-to-date, with no signs of slowing down. ($COST)

🥊 **Adobe Faces the AI Critics:** Adobe is finding out that even being a generative AI pioneer doesn’t guarantee smooth sailing. The company’s FY2025 guidance sent shares tumbling 13%, marking its worst day in two years. While Q4 results—$5.61 billion in revenue and $4.81 per share in profit—beat analyst estimates, the future is less certain. Investors are jittery over competition from AI startups like OpenAI, which are encroaching on Adobe’s turf with creative tools that could siphon market share.   
  
Adobe isn’t sitting still, though. Its AI tool, Firefly, has been integrated across key products like Photoshop and Premiere, logging a whopping 16 billion uses. Executives are betting on a new, higher-priced Firefly tier to boost margins in 2025. But Wall Street’s patience is running thin, with many still questioning whether Adobe can defend its position in an AI-driven world. ($ADBE)

# Judge Blocks Coach Owner Tapestry’s Proposed Acquisition Of Michael Kors Parent Capri

Capri Holdings, home to Michael Kors and Versace, had a rough Friday—its stock took a 50% plunge after the FTC blocked its $8.5 billion merger with Tapestry, the parent of Coach and Kate Spade. 

The court’s move wasn’t just a tap on the wrist; it’s a signal that antitrust watchdogs are serious about keeping mid-tier luxury competitive. While Capri shareholders are licking their wounds, Tapestry's stock saw a 13% pop, signaling investors might be happy to see the extra cash redirected elsewhere.

Blocking the Luxury Stack

U.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon ruled in favor of the FTC, calling the planned merger an anti-competitive power move that would kill choice for shoppers who prefer “accessible luxury”—think designer handbags without the four-figure price tags. 

According to the FTC, combining brands like Coach, Kate Spade, and Michael Kors would hand Tapestry a whopping 59% share of the accessible-luxury market. 

For consumers, the FTC says, this would mean fewer handbag options and higher prices—a tough pill for budget-conscious buyers who’ve already faced years of inflation.

Investors and Analysts React

Capri was banking on the merger as a lifeline for its slumping Michael Kors line, but Tapestry, in better financial health, might have wiggle room to explore other options. The company even hinted it might appeal the decision, calling it “incorrect on the law and the facts.”

But the reaction was clear: Tapestry stock shot up as investors speculated the brand could use its funds to bolster shareholder value, like through buybacks. Capri, on the other hand, faces a murkier path forward as it deals with the fallout.

Big Win for the FTC, but the Battle Rages On

The FTC under Lina Khan has been on an antitrust tear, challenging mergers across tech, retail, and beyond. This victory is another feather in its cap and signals to the market that regulators aren’t backing down anytime soon. 

With more cases queued up, from Kroger-Albertsons to Google’s looming breakup, the FTC is signaling it’s ready to play hardball in keeping markets competitive. Whether these battles reshape corporate America’s playbook remains to be seen—but for now, Tapestry and Capri might have to keep their handbags separate.

# Keurig to Buy Stake In Ghost Energy Drinks for More Than $1 Billion

Keurig Dr Pepper is spicing up its lineup, grabbing a 60% stake in Ghost Energy for $990 million, with plans to fully own it by 2028.

Known for its quirky flavors like Sour Patch Kids, Ghost is a standout in the energy drink crowd—a market that’s brewing up serious competition. It’s KDP’s biggest buy since the $19 billion Dr Pepper Snapple acquisition in 2018, and the move pushes Keurig even further from its coffee roots into the ultra-buzzy energy drink space.

**Why Ghost? Why Now?**

Ghost isn’t your average energy drink; it’s lifestyle-focused and sports colorful flavors that give it shelf appeal. Keurig’s move here isn’t just about caffeine; it’s about capturing a younger, more fitness-conscious crowd leaning away from traditional coffee. 

With energy drinks on a growth tear, KDP is taking no chances, even investing another $250 million to slide Ghost into its own distribution system by 2025.

**Keeping Up with the Competition**

The energy drink aisle is packed, with Monster and Celsius as top players, but KDP’s been busy building its presence—last year it scooped up 30% of C4 Energy’s parent company, Nutrabolt, for $863 million. 

Coca-Cola’s backing Monster, Pepsi’s tied up with Celsius, and now Keurig’s doubling down on Ghost. The move could keep KDP in the energy game, while its traditional soda and coffee segments face tighter margins from price-conscious buyers.

**Energy Drinks: KDP’s Fresh Flavor**

Keurig’s bold move into Ghost shows it’s ready to go head-to-head with soda’s biggest rivals. With consumer tastes shifting, energy drinks are KDP’s shot to stay relevant in a crowded beverage market—and the quadrupled growth Ghost has seen over three years is a good place to start. 

Ghost’s founders will stay on to steer the brand as it joins Keurig’s lineup, keeping an eye on that high-energy, high-growth crowd KDP’s now banking on.

# On The Horizon

# Next Week

After a calm stretch, get ready for a packed week. The big headline? Thursday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will serve as a key gauge for inflation and the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight to bring prices down. If inflation shows signs of cooling, expect markets to cheer. But if the report disappoints, more volatility could be on the horizon.

Before that, Tuesday kicks off with the NFIB optimism index, giving insight into small business sentiment—a vital metric since small businesses make up nearly half of U.S. GDP. Then, on Wednesday, we’ll get a look at wholesale inventories, a key factor for understanding the pace of manufacturing and GDP growth.

Thursday isn’t just about CPI—weekly jobless claims will also roll in, giving an update on the labor market. And to finish the week strong, Friday’s Producer Price Index (PPI) will provide an early look at inflation from the perspective of manufacturers, followed by earnings reports from JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, signaling the start of a new earnings season.

As if that weren’t enough, we’ll also hear from nine Federal Reserve officials throughout the week. Wall Street will be analyzing their every word for hints of what’s to come in monetary policy.

I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right? 

It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don’t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**

If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn’t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. 

All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I’ve learned my lesson: **if you aren’t willing to hold the underlying, don’t buy it just solely for the merger.**",2024-01-19,175,137

***Bullet Blockchain’s Subsidiary, First Bitcoin Capital LLC, Continues to Pursue Unlicensed Violators of Bullet Blockchain’s Intellectual Property***

RENO, NV, Dec. 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via [NewMediaWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=B_Cu_DdLbSqQmdN_89NzAhlBV1YgbwBe35jms06EiYzvCc8D2H_1xos8tTCupacVpKx-7ECzTK_TCpIHJFO6tHKx76SiYGp1wddDIZFN32o=) – Bullet Blockchain, Inc. (“BULT” or the “Company”), (OTC: BULT), a pioneering software development and SaaS company at the forefront of blockchain technologies and Web 3.0, proudly announces a significant milestone: the successful deployment of 10 licensed Bitcoin ATMs across the state of Georgia as the first stage of its planned deployment and branding of 30 Bitcoin ATM kiosks.

[*As previously announced,*](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mY1Ji9LGnMlpI9v0W2H3VqbVTK6tBYme1ZU9TT7Fxoq9Ed1GD3qBQrRf1Qchmz3LFnxY9poMTuQGqRhcSfMbRylw1RFsx9M3AFCPEj8WTYXy_RqMQMIyWIY3c6GX1k1qqfm0qZY8G2zlurmPm7OeT9DWhh2kQIz-z0v9H2DGuWRngJPQkTWaCLORfo2-JvnSGus1fR_OriujPR0nB3UJCTnRfdQgDOnDmCZ_UdK9ipFM6kHvO2YUqHluMeptW_VNY4ds1GPsbHMwQxfNDbUCdayU3cfSIwbm7bhQfNRYiWaZwfo8OVFstdsZriyDWKzar0ieGf9Mcc8_6nLmfmSuGbze6TET4kOG3VkguB3Cvtc=) BULT recently completed a strategic transaction to acquire a portfolio of Bitcoin ATMs. With this acquisition, BULT is excited to extend its cryptocurrency offerings and improve accessibility of digital assets for the residents of Georgia. The integration of BULT's IP Portfolio into these Bitcoin ATMs establishes the first licensed Bitcoin ATM network in North America. “We are thrilled to be one of the few publicly traded Bitcoin ATM companies, launching and branding the Bullet ATMs to serve the growing demand,” stated Simon Rubin, Chief Executive Officer of BULT. “With Bitcoin continuing to gain traction as an asset class, Bitcoin ATMs provide a straightforward and accessible way for individuals to participate. We see great potential in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, where diverse communities are increasingly interested in Bitcoin. We are confident that our Bullet ATMs will be well-received within the local community.” This move is in line with the rapidly growing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions.

Bitcoin ATMs offer a user-friendly, secure, and convenient means for individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash. Transactions are typically completed within minutes, bridging the gap between traditional fiat currency and digital assets. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to rise, Bitcoin ATMs are poised for a promising future in the United States. Bullet ATMs have become a preferred choice for accessing the Bitcoin market, especially for those seeking alternatives to online brokers or exchanges. Simon Rubin, CEO of BULT, emphasized, “Bullet ATMs provide a practical alternative to online exchanges, making Bitcoin accessible to both seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers alike.”

Bitcoin ATMs have experienced significant growth in the United States, driven by the increasing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions.

155zisu_SNOW,SNOW,THE COURTS HAVE BLOCKED AMC FROM CONCERTING $APE INTO $AMC SHARES. A MOVE WHICH WOULD HAVE MASSIVELY DILUTED $AMC....LETS GO BOYS 💹,"AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) vaulted 61% after hours Friday, and as much as 100% -- and AMC Preferred Equity units (APE) nosedived 42% -- on word that a settlement paving the way for a share conversion was rejected by a Delaware court.

That marks a surprising win for the company's ""Ape army"" of meme-stock holders.

Delaware law provides that its Court of Chancery review all class-action settlements.

""Citing AMC’s financial situation, the parties have sought to present their settlement for approval on a compressed timeframe,"" Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn wrote in her opinion. ""Even moving quickly, the Court must ensure that the proposed settlement is fair and fulfills the principles of due process. To cut to the chase, the settlement cannot be approved as submitted.""

The settlement purported to release not only claims tied to the common stock, but also claims associated with preferred interests that common stockholders might also hold, and ""the release cannot properly extend to those latter claims."" It also purports to release claims that don't arise from the same factual predicate, she ruled.

The plaintiffs being common stockholders, they can't release claims appurtenant to the preferred units, she added. ""Awarding more shares to common stockholders necessarily comes at the expense of preferred units; the settlement consideration harms preferred unitholders.""

AMC had pursued a plan to convert APEs into AMC common stock; execute a reverse stock split; and issue shares to raise new capital.

That resulted in litigation to stop the plan, and then a quick class-action settlement that would allow its progress. The Court of Chancery applied the brakes so it could review the settlement, and has now rejected it.",2023-07-21,1359,597

14aob5x_SQ,SQ,"With 64% ownership, Block, Inc.($SQ) boasts of strong institutional backing","* Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Block's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
* 50% of the business is held by the top 20 shareholders

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Block, Inc. it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 64% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or loses the most if there is a downturn).  
  
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.  


# What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Block?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.  
  
Block already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Block's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Block. Because actions speak louder than words, it is a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Block's case, its President, Jack Dorsey, is the largest shareholder, holding 8.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second-largest shareholder holds about 5.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by ownership of 5.4% by the third-largest shareholder.  
  
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.  
  
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

# Insider Ownership Of Block

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or CEO.  
  
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions, it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.  


# General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- owns a 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

As we gear up for another week, let's take a look at the economic calendar, specifically focusing on Monday's lineup. At 8:30 am Eastern Time, we begin with the release of the Empire State manufacturing survey for the month of May. A slight chill might run through the market, as the median forecast is currently pegged at a less-than-optimistic -5.0. This is a dramatic swing from the previous 10.8, indicating a possible shift in the manufacturing sector.

However, the day's events are far from over. Concurrently, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will make a televised appearance, promising a rich discussion and invaluable insights into the current economic landscape.

Finally, the morning's agenda concludes at 9:15 am with a presentation from the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari. His remarks are always keenly anticipated and will certainly provide much fodder for market analysis. So, as we embrace the new week, stay tuned for a Monday filled with informative and potentially market-moving events.

Bears failed to close under 408.87 and the gap at 408.64 - 402.72 remains protected. We have liquidity at 414.89 and a gap at 414.77 - 415.27 that bulls will try to overcome this week. A close above 415.27 opens the door for a liquidity grab at 417.62 and 418.31. Bears need to take out prior day low at 408.87 for the 408.64 - 402.72 gap fill.

13bjpdh_INTC,INTC,Argo Blockchain ($ARBKF) slumps to a full-year loss on the Bitcoin price slide.,"Argo Blockchain ($ARB), the one U.Ok.-listed cryptocurrency miner, slumped to a full-year loss in 2022 as the value of bitcoin ($BTC) dropped and mining problem elevated, driving up prices as income fell.

The London-based firm reported a net loss of 194.2 million British kilos (US$240 million), or 40.98 pence a share, in contrast with internet earnings of 30.8 million kilos, or 7.4 pence, the yr earlier than, it mentioned in an announcement. The bitcoin worth slumped greater than 60% final yr.

Miners throughout the board struggled in 2022 as income declined alongside the bitcoin worth whereas vitality prices soared and the problem of mining a bitcoin block, which is when they’re rewarded, soared. Whereas rivals equivalent to Core Scientific and Compute North filed for chapter safety, Argo averted the identical destiny by agreeing to sell its Helios mining facility in Dickens Nation, Texas, to Galaxy Digital for $65 million. It additionally negotiated a brand new $35 million mortgage from investor Michael Novogratz’s crypto-focused financial-services agency, secured by its mining tools.

Argo’s mining margin widened to 45%-50% within the first quarter from 35% within the fourth quarter, whereas each day bitcoin manufacturing rose 5%. Argo mentioned it’ll now give attention to its operations in Quebec, Canada, the place it operates two websites totaling 20 megawatts (MW) of energy.

“Having navigated difficult market situations in each the crypto sector and the worldwide economic system within the second half of 2022, Argo has emerged stronger and in a way more stable monetary place,” interim CEO Seif El-Bakly mentioned within the assertion. Peter Wall resigned as CEO nearly three months in the past.

The flagship Helios website did not have a fixed-rate energy settlement, which meant prices rose sharply amid the 2022 energy crisis. Argo tried to raise funds to keep away from chapter, then finally determined to promote the positioning, which has the potential of reaching 800 MW of energy consumption. 

The agency ended the yr with 2.5 exahash/second of computing energy, barely lower than the 3.2 EH/s it foresaw in August 2022.

Argo is one of a handful of companies that agreed to purchase chipmaking big Intel’s (INTC) bitcoin mining application-specific built-in circuits (ASIC) in February 2022. It’s designed a mining rig using those chips along with hardware maker ePIC Blockchain.

131jf3b_SQ,SQ,Why Block ($SQ) stock is a no-brainer pre-earnings buy," 

In just a matter of days, an earnings event is very likely to jolt Block ($SQ) stock higher. The time to consider an investment in Block is right now as the company continues to grow and innovate, and is bound to overcome Wall Street’s low expectations.

Block is known for pioneering Square, Cash App and other point-of-sale platforms. Plus, Block is cryptocurrency-friendly. For instance, the company is partnering with African crypto exchange Yellow Card to “facilitate cross-border payments between 16 countries in Africa.” 

Granted, Block didn’t impress analysts and investors with its previously released financial results. That’s fine, though, as there’s a prime setup for a Street beat, and it’s not too late to buy a few shares of SQ stock.

## Block Makes Square Even More Powerful

Block already upended the payments-platform space with the Square app. Now, the company is making Square even more powerful with nearly 100 new features.

Primarily aimed at sellers, the new and improved Square includes:

* Waitlists, which automates waiting lists for appointment slots and services
* Subscriptions, which “enables online buyers to subscribe to items or services on a recurring basis”
* OpenTable and Square for Restaurants integration, designed to facilitate efficient restaurant dining-room management
* Batch Invoices that allow sellers to “send the same invoice template to multiple customers at once”
* More options and control for online and omni-channel sellers with Busy Mode, Pre-orders and Pause Online Orders features

I could keep going for a long time, but you get the idea. On top of all that, Square just launched its Tap to Pay software on Android for sellers in the U.K. This allows sellers to “securely accept contactless payments with a compatible Android device, and at no additional cost.”**SQ Stock Has Rocket-Ride Potential on May 4**

 

Clearly, Block hasn’t slowed down as the company strives to make its point-of-sale software as robust and accessible as possible. This, by itself, is a pretty good reason to invest in Block now.

Another reason is Block’s consistent growth as a business. This can be measured by Block’s gross profit, which has expanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 45% during the past five years.

This isn’t to suggest that Block’s progress has been perfect at very turn. Certainly, investors were disappointed when Block posted a $114 million net earnings loss during 2022’s fourth quarter. Furthermore, Block’s quarterly adjusted EPS of 22 cents fell short of Wall Street’s forecast of 30 cents.

However, yesterday’s disappointment can lead to tomorrow’s relief rally. Block’s next earnings report is set for May 4 after the market closes. The company has had more EPS beats than misses, so the previous quarter’s miss was a headline-grabber.

If Block can do better than Wall Street’s first-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS estimate of 35 cents, SQ stock has moonshot potential. Even an in-line result or a near miss could send the share price higher.",2023-04-28,0,7

12x6rtd_SQ,SQ,Forsta AP Fonden increases stake in Square ($SQ) despite disappointing earnings results," 

Forsta AP Fonden, a Swedish investment fund, has recently increased its stake in Block ($SQ), a technology company that provides payment and point-of-sale solutions in the United States and internationally. According to the fund’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21, 2023, it now owns 130,400 shares of Block’s stock. This represents a 22.2% increase from their previous holdings and is valued at $8,194,000.

Block last reported its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, February 23rd. Unfortunately for investors, the company missed consensus expectations by reporting an EPS of ($0.23), lower than the expected ($0.16). Their revenue came in at $4.65 billion for the quarter compared to estimates of $4.53 billion.

Despite these figures painting a less-than-rosy picture for Block’s future prospects, Forsta AP Fonden clearly still sees potential in investing in them. So what exactly does Square offer?

Founded in 2009 by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Square provides a range of payment and point-of-sale solutions that have proven hugely popular with small business owners across America and beyond. Their tech allows sellers to turn mobile devices into reading spots for magstripe and contactless payments without having to buy multiple units or expensive equipment.

Square offers hardware products such as a Magstripe reader which enables swiped transactions through magnetic stripe cards; a Contactless and Chip reader that accepts EMV chip cards as well as near field communication payments; Square Stand that uses iPads as full point-of-sale or payment terminals; as well as Square Register managed payments solutions. 

The rise of e-commerce continues to disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar retail outlets but Square has found success in catering to small businesses looking for something more flexible than conventional point-of-sales systems while keeping operational costs low.

In summary, despite missing estimates during their latest earnings report, Square’s technology continues to gain traction in the market. From small business owners to investment funds like Forsta AP Fonden, many see value in Square’s innovative point-of-sale solutions and believe it has the potential to be a game-changer in the industry.",2023-04-24,12,4

Highlights:

>Our 2-year investigation has concluded that Block has systematically taken advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping. The “magic” behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.

>Our research indicates, however, that Block has wildly overstated its genuine user counts and has understated its customer acquisition costs. Former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.

>Core to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked” segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West” approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.

>In an apparent effort to preserve its growth engine, Cash App ignored internal employee concerns, along with warnings from the Secret Service, the U.S. Department of Labor OIG, FinCEN, and State Regulators which all specifically flagged the issue of multiple COVID relief payments going to the same account as an obvious sign of fraud.

>Congress passed a law that legally caps “interchange fees” charged by large banks that have over $10 billion in assets. Despite having $31 billion in assets, Block avoids these regulations by routing payments through a small bank and gouging merchants with elevated fees.

>Block includes only a single vague reference in its filings acknowledging it earns revenue from “interchange fees”. It has never revealed the full economics of this category, yet over one-third of Cash App’s revenue came from this opaque source, according to a 2022 Credit Suisse research report.

>Competitor PayPal has disclosed it is under investigation by both the SEC and the CFPB over its similar use of a small bank to avoid “interchange fee” caps. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request we filed with the SEC indicates that Block may be part of a similar investigation.

>In sum, we think Block has misled investors on key metrics, and embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst-practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.",2023-03-23,806,186
11zjdx3_SQ,SQ,Hindenburg Research announce that Block Inc. ($SQ) are overstating user counts and understating customer acquisition costs,"Full report: [Block: How Inflated User Metrics and “Frictionless” Fraud Facilitation Enabled Insiders To Cash Out Over $1 Billion](https://hindenburgresearch.com/block/)

Some selected points:

* Our 2-year investigation has concluded that Block has systematically taken advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping. The “magic” behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.

* Our research indicates, however, that Block has wildly overstated its genuine user counts and has understated its customer acquisition costs. Former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.

* Core to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked” segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West” approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.

* Even when users were caught engaging in fraud or other prohibited activity, Block blacklisted the account without banning the user. A former customer service rep shared screenshots showing how blacklisted accounts were regularly associated with dozens or hundreds of other active accounts suspected of fraud. This phenomenon of allowing blacklisted users was so common that rappers bragged about it in hip hop songs.

* Block obfuscates how many individuals are on the Cash App platform by reporting misleading “transacting active” metrics filled with fake and duplicate accounts. Block can and should clarify to investors an estimate on how many unique people actually use Cash App.

* Beyond facilitating payments for criminal activity, the platform has been overrun with scam accounts and fake users, according to numerous interviews with former employees.

* The data shows that compared to its Ohio competitor, Cash App’s partner bank had nearly 10x the number of applicants who applied for benefits through a bank account used by another claimant – a clear red flag of fraud.

* Block reported a pandemic surge in user counts and revenue, ignoring the contribution of widespread fraudulent accounts and payments. The new business provided a sharp one-time increase to Block’s stock, which rose 639% in 18 months during the pandemic.

* In sum, we think Block has misled investors on key metrics, and embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst-practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.

* We also believe Jack Dorsey has built an empire—and amassed a $5 billion personal fortune—professing to care deeply about the demographics he is taking advantage of. With Dorsey and top executives already having sold over $1 billion in equity on Block’s meteoric pandemic run higher, they have ensured they will be fine, regardless of the outcome for everyone else.",2023-03-23,1423,324

zg8c32_MS,MS,FTC sues to block Microsoft’s acquisition of game giant Activision,"

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-microsoft-over-activision/

>The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, charging that the massive deal would allow the Washington tech giant to suppress its competitors in gaming.

>The lawsuit represents the FTC’s most significant effort to rein in consolidation in the tech industry since prominent tech critic Lina Khan (D) became the commission’s chair and was expected to usher in a new era of antitrust enforcement characterized by a willingness to bring cases in court rather than pursue settlements with companies.

...


This represents the most obvious real-life answer to the people asking if the MS/Activision deal was free money (and how it isn't). It looks like Lina Khan might be looking to make a name for herself in pursuing antitrust action by going after more M&A.

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

wncib2_SQ,SQ,I sold my $SQ stock recently. Is this a good move?,"I took advantage of the recent rally to sell my $SQ shares. I must admit that I bought in at much higher prices without much research. After holding for some time and a few quarterly earnings later, I figured that the management execution is not up to my expectations and the business have no real strong moats. Here are some of the reasons that made me decide to take the loss:

1. There's too much competition in the FinTech space that no single player can dominate.
2. Path to profitability is unclear, business model lacks scalability.
3. Poor acquisition actions. Buying TIDAL that doesn't really add synergy to the core business. Paid a sky-high valuation for AFTERPAY in the form of stock, resulting in huge share dilution. Revenue addition from Afterpay is not impressive either.
4. Invest in speculative assets and businesses (Bitcoin) when main business isn't profitable yet.
5. Valuation is still arguably expensive even after the recent plunge. Growth rates have slowed, and there's no clear plan to accelerate it. Uncertain if the current business model has any operating leverage.

Basically that's it. Lost my conviction to hold. They might get hit further if we go into a deep recession since a lot of their customers are SMEs.

wgaiq6_SQ,SQ,Why I'm getting SQ calls for tonight's earnings.,"Block, Inc., formerly Square, Inc., is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.

Consider the fact that the company's stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.

**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**

https://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq

Square on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. 

In its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.

Cash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.

**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**

At the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.

Square is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square's gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.

Square and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.

**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**

In a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.

""Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term,"" he wrote.

Announced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging ""[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)"" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM). Some investors questioned whether Block needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the buy now, pay later market. Block's 2022 guidance includes an expected $1 billion in Afterpay operating expenses. UBS analyst Rayna Kumar in a report said the ""risk profile"" of Afterpay has changed amid rising interest rates and the potential of increased regulation.

Square stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.

**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**

For merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there's still a risk of defaults.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App's direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.

Square is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.

The Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company's subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.

To broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma's tax business for $50 million in cash. It's a free service for consumers.

**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**

With roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved ""upmarket,"" targeting larger businesses.

SQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).

In addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.

Square recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.

**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**

The company's Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.

Meanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.

Square on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.

In trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.

One key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume — total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers — also known as GPV. It's a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.

**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Square earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.

Square said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.

Financial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.

Gross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.

In a letter to shareholders, management said: ""Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square.""

Excluding Afterpay, the company said ""gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year.""

**Block Stock Technical Analysis**

After its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.

That soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google in stature.

Following its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019. Then shares surged in 2020 as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App.",2022-08-04,39,67

In early July when Tesla (TSLA) stock was trading around $680, we looked at how options were pricing the upcoming month that included an earnings event. Tesla is a stock that has tended to move alot more than options are pricing when it gets moving (both higher and lower) over the past year.

>TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

That 15% move by end of July was pricing a bullish consensus of about $780 in the stock. With this move higher Tesla actually ended July at $890, +$110 above what options were pricing at the time.

After the move higher Tesla options are pricing about 10% for August, which would put the stock near $800 or $1000:

From last week’s preview:

>Tech and growth stocks weighed on the markets last week. The QQQ is approaching the lows the ETF saw in mid-March. IWM is already at the lows it saw several times this year. Some of the largest cap names in the QQQ report earnings this week and the reaction of the market to those reports will likely determine whether these levels hold.

Those levels did not hold and as the indices cracked implied volatility spiked. The market was led lower by stocks like Amazon, which was -14% on Friday following an unpleasant reaction to its earnings report on Thursday afternoon. Of the large companies to report, Meta and Microsoft were able to buck the trend and finished higher on the week. This week’s earnings aren’t large-cap market movers like last week, but they are reporting into an environment of very high market volatility, the highest of this earnings cycle (so far).

uan8i8_SQ,SQ,"Block ($SQ) co-founder Jack Dorsey no longer the tech firm’s CEO, changes title to Block Head","[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/22/jack-dorseys-new-title-block-head.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/22/jack-dorseys-new-title-block-head.html)

[Jack Dorsey](https://www.cnbc.com/jack-dorsey/) is no longer the CEO of [Block](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SQ). He no longer has the title, at least.

In a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001512673/000119312522115187/d337596d8k.htm) with the SEC on Friday, the company formerly known as Square said Dorsey has changed his title to Block Head. Block updated its bylaws to reflect Dorsey’s new role, removing the requirement for the company to have an officer holding the titles of CEO and president.

It’s yet another way that Dorsey is intersecting with Tesla’s [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/), who is [trying](https://carbon.cnbc.com/107049558) to buy [Twitter](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR), the other company that Dorsey co-founded and used to run. Last year, Musk [took on](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/elon-musk-officially-made-the-technoking-of-tesla.html) the title of “Technoking of Tesla,” although he still continues as CEO. Musk later said his position as CEO was “a made-up title.”

Dorsey has made similar comments at least as far back as 2012, when he tweeted, “Titles, like ‘CEO’, get in the way of doing the right thing. Respect to the people who ignore titles, and fight like hell for what is right.”",2022-04-24,31,4

&#x200B;

Paypal on the other hand has a 47.38% gross margin and a 16.31% net margin, competing in similar fields (Clover deal for PoS). They are already a 20%+ free cash flow margin machine. Plus, they have an Amazon deal on the way. All the while, they are at 25b in annual revenue.

&#x200B;

Block is focused too broadly, and it's becoming increasingly confusing on how to describe Block. Is it a PoS company? A crpyto company?

sowg19_SQ,SQ,"Block, inc.[Tick: SQ], Will Apple's ""Tap to pay"" contactless payment function on the iPhone threaten Block's business?","I have been observing Block's stock for a while, and I think it is at an attractive pricepoint, last seen in Q3 2020; as it has dropped over 50% since its peak.

But, now I'm having doubts over its longer-term growth and viability because of Apple.

Apple recently introduced a Tap-To-Pay function on its iPhone, quote: 

> The new capability will empower millions of merchants across the US, from small businesses to large retailers, to use their iPhone to seamlessly and securely accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets through a simple tap to their iPhone — no additional hardware or payment terminal needed. 

This looks to me like a direct challenge to Block's business model, with Square's terminal and Cashapp ecosystem.

Major U.S.-based payment processor PayPal has assembled a team of industry experts to act as advisors on crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies. 

In a Tuesday announcement, PayPal said the addition of six members to its Blockchain, Crypto and Digital Currencies advisory council would help support its current and future products as well as its goal of creating a more inclusive digital financial ecosystem. Fortress Investment Group co-CEO Peter Briger, Georgetown University Law Center professor Chris Brummer, Weizmann Institute of Science professor Shafi Goldwasser, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Timothy Massad, MIT Sloan School of Management finance professor Antoinette Schoar, and MIT Digital Currency Initiative director Neha Narula will be joining the PayPal initiative.

“We believe it is crucial to engage with the world’s best leaders to better understand the industry’s most compelling opportunities and complex challenges,” said Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal’s senior vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto, and digital currencies.

All six advisers carry years of experience from the crypto and blockchain space from a business or regulatory perspective. Briger was reportedly the one responsible for advising Softbank Group founder Masayoshi Son to invest millions in Bitcoin (BTC) prior to the 2017 bull run. Goldwasser was part of a group of MIT researchers who proposed zero-knowledge proof as an encryption scheme long before the advent of crypto.

During her time with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Narula has been in charge of an initiative to help the federal reserve bank of Boston build a digital currency aimed at scaling for consumer use. Brummer was reportedly a candidate for CFTC chair before President Joe Biden officially nominated Rostin Behnam. Massad, who served as CFTC chair from 2014 to 2017, argued after he left his position that regulators should approve an exchange-traded fund offering exposure to BTC.

I did a check on the IV and for PYPL the IV is 12% lower than the usual level. This means its not 50% which would be average for the year, its at 38% so if it does anything but stagnate the contracts will go up.

For those of you that don’t remember or haven’t read some of my other posts. Here’s a description of the boxes/zones I’ve overlaid on the chart.

* Red Zone = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play.
* Orange Zone = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone.
* Green Zone = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade.

Of course, these zones are very easy to notice after-the-fact. Going into June CCJ would have looked to have been on a steady up-trend and buying any dips earlier this year along the way would have netted some nice returns.

&#x200B;

I’ll be keeping an eye on CCJ next week to see what happens with this squeeze or if it reverts back to the mean. Entering a new position here and chasing FOMO is extremely risky. I’ll be keeping an eye on this if it goes back into the low $20’s to enter another position.

&#x200B;

Let’s look at my short-list of “buy the dip” stocks this week.

# The BTFD (Buy The F’n Dip) List

**Ametek (AME)**

https://preview.redd.it/38dkmfhlj5n71.png?width=2404&format=png&auto=webp&s=803267ccea4bfeade96c1570d09223ce3802b60b

If you don’t know about Ametek then all you need to know is that it is a beast of a company. Strong fundamentals, strong business model, and is nicknamed the “niche acquirer” from their strategic list of acquisitions. AME is typically a very slow moving stock, similar to Microsoft, but if you zoom the chart out over a couple years you’ll see this thing only goes up. The very small dip recently might prove to be a good entry point if you’ve been waiting to get in for some time. Ex-dividend date is also tomorrow. So I would expect this to be slightly green, if the market permits, to make up for the div.

&#x200B;

**Salesforce (CRM)**

https://preview.redd.it/ahl11f3mj5n71.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=4049d6c64e87d0f805682ad8fbbc9aff60e17492

Another long-term stock for my portfolio. CRM saw some tailwinds early on during Covid, but over the last 12 months the stock price has stalled. In my opinion last week’s dip could be a good entry. The $250 level, which was previously resistance, might also be a good support zone to enter. Keep an eye on the 50 EMA which it was been bouncing off during this recent uptrend since May.

&#x200B;

# The MEME List

The “meme” list isn’t necessarily meme stocks, but it’s what I refer to when I’m talking about stocks that have potential to trend on social media, or they are generally higher-risk growth-stocks.

&#x200B;

**Square (SQ)**

https://preview.redd.it/2s81jromj5n71.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=4895c9ae388d2f7562af1729e44a6b28ad646d65

Square, which saw insane growth through Covid, has somewhat lost it’s momentum. This 10% dip over the last several weeks gives it a better entry than at $275 when it was a slightly over-extended. RSI hitting over-sold and volume profile sitting right at the shelf where trading volume thins out. IMO this is a quality name to own for the long-term and although the stock is up a lot in the last 6 months, today offers a better entry.

&#x200B;

**D-Local (DLO)**

https://preview.redd.it/jr0aanhnj5n71.png?width=2398&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8608a6c86738b337ced80d2f1ca7a817fb7ca44

You don’t see this name around Reddit too much, but I think it deserves to get on most people’s radar. DLO is a payment processor for Latin America, and 3rd world/emerging markets. The growth they are experiencing is over 100% YoY, which drove the stock price +30% on earnings in August. Since then it’s had about a month’s worth of consolidation at the $65 level. I think here at $62 provides an “orange box” entry which I am willing to take a risk at. Ideally I would have liked to enter in the $50’s, but that’s what investing is all about, finding ideal risk-to-reward opportunities.",2021-09-12,71,21

You don’t see this name around Reddit too much, but I think it deserves to get on most people’s radar. DLO is a payment processor for Latin America, and 3rd world/emerging markets. The growth they are experiencing is over 100% YoY, which drove the stock price +30% on earnings in August. Since then it’s had about a month’s worth of consolidation at the $65 level. I think here at $62 provides an “orange box” entry which I am willing to take a risk at. Ideally I would have liked to enter in the $50’s, but that’s what investing is all about, finding ideal risk-to-reward opportunities.",2021-09-12,10,3

oypavi_SQ,SQ,255% Profit SQ trade breakdown," 

SQ had a monster move on Monday post the Afterpay acquisiton news. Therefore, it was only fair it consolidated before starting another leg up.

SQ on Monday had failed to reclaim its $277 level as support, sliding below it when testing it for support. However, at around Monday's high, multiple high value call sweeps and Dark Pool buys had been alerted

On Tuesday it reacted pretty harshly to the failure to claim 277, and was down 5% at one point. Yesterday, too, was spent basing at the 260-261 support level.

It gathered buyers at those levels, and since it was having consecutive inside days following Monday, it used the momentum of breaking through Monday's candle for a break of the 277 resistance and the following second leg up.

The ascending triangle pattern it thus formed, that resulted in the leg up to 289, was necessary since above 277, SQ finds itself in the supply zone.

Entry:

I entered $280c 8/6 exp at [10:24 AM](https://www.reddit.com/user/pseudoku727/comments/oxs2ou/scalping_thread/h7t5xsq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) @ 2.7 per contract

Reasoning:

1. The price action had settled into a structure.
2. Secondly, the large call sweeps and buy orders (orders from whales) that came in Monday at the high were still in red. This added credence that SQ was determined to run
3. 279.xx was the HOD until then and each retest of it was with decreasing volume, indicating sellers at that level being exhausted
4. Further, the price rejected a move below both the 9 EMA and the 277 support when they were aligned, singalling confluence

Play out:

1. 2 high volume green candles followed the break of the ascending triangle getting us to $283.xx
2. $283.xx was the previous high set on 02/16
3. The price started to base there using the 02/16's high as support in a manner that's typical of healthy uptrends
4. Each candle following the 10:51 am candle was inside the previous one, along with decreasing volume, forming a pennant. This indicated consolidation
5. As expected right at 11 am, a high volume green candle took out the inside candles and we resumed the rally
6. Consecutive green candles rallied us 288.5

Exit:

1. What followed was a hanging man candle that came in just as I got alerted of large Dark Pool sell transactions at that level
2. Usually Dark Pool orders can give an indication of momentum
3. Therefore, with those alerts in tandem with the Hanging Man candle stick pattern, I exited my position at 11:16 AM @ 9.6 per contract
4. After closing my order I noticed the candle closed with almost a Dark Cloud Cover pattern with really strong volume.
5. Price Volume Analysis enthusiasts will tell you how this would be an indication of top for the day.

Trade technicals:

1. Time in trade - 42 minutes
2. Price of contract at entry - 2.7
3. Price of contract at close - 9.6

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

o8fvqo_SQ,SQ,"PayPal (PYPL) gonna drop, Square (SQ) gonna pop (DD)","Small business owner here that uses PayPal (PYPL) but has just been convinced to switch my hundreds of accounts to Square (SQ). I sell music and books, primarily, and use PayPal checkout. Today PayPal just sent out their new price increases for August 2nd, and the number hikes are unnecessary and much higher than Square, their main competitor. 

For example, a credit card payment with Square carries fees of $0.10 plus 2.6% of the transaction amount. The online fee is $0.30 plus 2.9%. If you manually key in a credit card, it jumps to $0.15 plus 3.5%, which feels dumb until you consider why a card might not scan, and this is insurance on those transactions.

PayPal was competitive at $0.30 plus 2.9% per transaction, regardless if keyed in or run. 

PayPal is now increasing their cut to $0.49 plus 3.49% per transaction, a 0.5% plus $0.19 hike. That may not sound like much, but over thousands of transactions, that's a ton of money I'm losing on fees. So I have to spend the weekend dropping new codes into purchase buttons...and those buttons will lead to Square.

As an investor, you might think more fees means more money for PayPal, but I promise you that in talking with other small business owners, we're acutely aware of that bottom line, and I've had many discussions on the merits of PayPal vs Square at major book and music conferences each year. Think about every small-time online retailer...they're going to vote with their pocketbook.

So there you have it. Think about getting some money on the Square train, as that shit might pop.

nbo9z0_SQ,SQ,SQ is trading at an absolute bargain right now,"I just wanna point this out for people who might be afraid to buy this stock right now. SQ is trading at a 7 PS ratio, that’s more than half of what it was on dec 22nd 2020. 

The only times it’s traded at a lower PS ratio than this post 2017 were Dec 2018, Aug 2019-Jan 2020 and March 2020 - May 2020. If you bought this stock in June 2020 or February 2020 you were buying it at an 8 PS ratio which is a higher valuation than what it is today.

Let’s compare this to PYPL. PYPL is growing at a steady 30% Y/Y and currently trading at a 12 PS ratio. SQs revenue growth Y/Y for the latest quarter is 266% and for the 2 previous ones it was over 100% for both. So SQ is growing revenue this fast yet trading at 2/3 the value of PYPL

Also in June 2020 PYPL reported 5.26 billion in revenue and had a market cap of around 180 billion, last quarter SQ reported 5.06 billion in revenue and has a market cap of 89 billion

With a valuation like this how much more will these growth stocks sell off? and why are people afraid to buy more with bargains like this

Edit: I don’t know where people’s brains are, they don’t understand how fast software as a service can grow, Bitcoin is 9% of their revenue, if they lost all that than ok a 9 PS ratio? That’s the value it was in February of 2020 and still cheaper than PYPL, even if you don’t include their crypto revenue SQ grew over 100% Y/Y and their monthly user base will continue to grow",2021-05-13,26,109

Now, Origin Trail is taking the next step. 

The constant increase in demand for the services enabled by the OriginTrail Decentralized Network has prompted the team to launch the project codenamed **OTEGA (OriginTrail Ecosystem Growth Acceleration)** initially presented within the Starfleet Taskforce of the Trace Alliance Working Group on Decentralization and Tokenomics. As the core OriginTrail team at Trace Labs grows increasingly overwhelmed by the queries from numerous markets (in various supply chains globally, self-sovereign identity (SSI) sector, blockchain forensics, other blockchain ecosystems …), it became increasingly apparent that there is a need to catalyze the entry of multiple additional stakeholders that would be able to address these growing needs.

To answer that, project OTEGA brings tools, frameworks, and programs for developers and system integrators to **utilize OriginTrail with legacy systems, blockchains, and applications.** 

This will enable them to take advantage of the power of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph technology with a high degree of independence. Furthermore, the aim is to **enable additional EVM compatible blockchain ecosystems (e.g., Moonbeam, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon/Matic, NEAR …)** to attach to the OriginTrail DKG easily and independently by following the OriginTrail consensus layer extension framework. With this, OriginTrail’s unique value proposition gets to be **expanded into other ecosystems**, with a concurrent exposure of the TRAC token to additional market opportunities (e.g., decentralized exchanges).

***The View from 30,000 Feet***

Blockchain payments innovator **RocketFuel** **Blockchain, Inc. (OTCQB – RKFL)** is poised to transform the global eCommerce industry, in our view. The Company is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and dozens of other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RocketFuel is the first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless and elegant one-click checkout experience that today's digital and mobile-centric consumers have come to expect from eCommerce marketplaces, such as **Amazon (NASDAQ – AMZN)**. 

The RocketFuel platform, based on patent-pending technology, enables merchants and consumers to easily complete payment for goods and services using 43 different cryptocurrencies or direct bank transfer in a completely secure environment. A significant benefit of the Company’s approach is that the entire shopping cart checkout process can be executed via a distributed ledger or blockchain. Thus, merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex, and costly payment and check-out infrastructures. With the one-click checkout used on RocketFuel-partnered sites, consumers will enjoy unrivalled convenience .

As is typically the case with new technologies and applications with a broad scope, we expect early adopters to dominate usage during 2021 as online merchants shopping cart and payment solutions providers implement the crypto acceptance functionality, with mass market utilization occurring in 2022. With estimates suggesting that the number of (non-Facebook) crypto wallet holders will grow to 250M+ in the next 2-3 years, up from 68M today, substantial adoption lies ahead.   

***The Problem***

eCommerce has enjoyed wide, mainstream adoption and in many cases has emerged as the shopping method of choice for consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, for merchants and consumers alike, many of the payment system setups and associated technologies in place today have underlying issues, which in turn have a deleterious effect on merchant/consumer transaction execution.

For consumers, payment systems and shopping cart utilization can be awkward and clunky, require multiple steps and redirects to 3rd parties, and may not be secure, resulting in a less than stellar customer experience. For merchants, the current eCommerce payment infrastructure is even more problematic. In most cases, merchants are required to use an intermediary, costing billions in excess expenses annually. Roughly 1 in 5 carts leave without completing a transaction because consumers do not trust the merchant’s system. Plus, in most cases, fees are high, payments are delayed, and exorbitant fees due to fraud, fraud prevention, and chargebacks related to the inefficient back-end operations can be excessive, reducing profits.

***The Solution*** 

In contrast, by leveraging modern blockchain technology and its proprietary platform, RocketFuel offers consumers a single-click pay solution, pay with crypto or direct bank transfer option with no redirects or filling out forms as the information is stored at once. The process is seamless-simple, efficient, secure, and convenient. Merchants generate higher shopping cart conversion, pay lower fees, have greater security, transparency, less fraud, and improved cash flow. With a better experience for both sides of the transaction, and improved order and shipping fulfillment, merchants can foster loyalty and generate recurring business. 

***Today and Tomorrow***

The Company launched its first product in a live environment in March 2021 and with two travel merchant customers and a tax auditing firm in hand, management intends to continue to develop the check-out technology with several larger U.S. eCommerce merchants, social media and blogsites. With connections to several larger eCommerce merchants, near term sales and marketing efforts will focus on a few “big fish” rather than many smaller merchants and will scale up initiatives as funding permits. We believe that the Company will also target specific verticals that may be a source of early adopters and crypto wallet holders in verticals such as online gambling, gaming, and with merchants selling high ticket items. In conjunction with this targeted approach, RocketFuel may utilize social media to generate awareness and attract consumer influencers. Given that the phase from early adoption to mass market adoption can take 12-18 months, we believe that the Company could enjoy exponential merchant sign-ups going forward, along with consumer utilization, from 2021-2022, with the greatest recurring platform utilization by consumers beginning in 2023. 

***Financial Forecasts and Valuation***

It is difficult to accurately project the deployment and adoption success of a new technology and application such as the unique RocketFuel blockchain and crypto payment service.  However, given the underlying growth rates in blockchain ledger utilization for financial and payment transactions, as well as the proliferation of crypto wallet adoption, it is clear that major upside exists. Widespread adoption and growth are further affirmed by the Company’s underlying offering which solves major unmet needs in eCommerce for merchants and consumers alike. As with many young companies, it comes down to efficient execution. The management has a strong, proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies.

We should note that our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to firmly estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.

To simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) and revenue of $12M in FY23E with net profit of $650K, or $0.02. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.

Given the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.

Finally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel’s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management’s capabilities.

**INDUSTRY PRIMER: BLOCKCHAIN**

📷

According to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.

A blockchain, also known as a “distributed ledger technology,” is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records used to secure transactions across multiple devices that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible.

Transactions in money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be implemented and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and sophisticated code---without intermediaries. Given the opportunities associated with such a disruptive technology, many firms in varied industries are actively operating in the space to transact business, agreements and financial transactions more efficiently.

Commercial and central banks across the world are now using blockchain technology for payment processing and issuing of their digital currencies. The technology enables cross-border payments that are less expensive and faster as compared to traditional systems. The remittance cost within the blockchain is 2% to 3% of the total amount as compared to other third parties as blockchain does not require third-party authentication. Even governments are introducing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) to replace cash and traditional fiat-currencies. Plus, they are putting social media behemoths such as Facebook and Google under scrutiny for their lack of privacy protection and data security.

One of the most popular applications of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Trading in cryptocurrency is relatively easy compared to other assets. You can begin trading just by signing up for various wallets on the market. Furthermore, there are different types of wallet apps, each with its own advantages, such as levels of security, accessibility, and more. The most popular and well-known wallet is Coinbase with 639,885 daily active users (DAUs). If Facebook’s Libra initiative to its 2B users is successful, this figure will be dwarfed in short order.

The payments segment dominated the market in 2020 and accounted for more than 44.0% share of the global revenue. Blockchain technology improves payment system efficiency, minimizes operating costs, and offers transparency. These benefits provided by blockchain technology are increasing its use in payment solutions, thus, driving the segment growth. At the same time, blockchain reduces the need for middlemen in payment processing, which is also a major factor driving the segment growth.

Bitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) is the most popular application of blockchain, but increasingly this innovative technology can be used in various business and commercial purposes. The elimination of the middleman in various transactions and processes promises a much more efficient workflow using blockchain. Additionally, increasing concerns about privacy and security make blockchain an ideal technological pipeline for modern processes.

Enter the eCommerce application.

**ROCKETFUEL: THE GAME-CHANGER**

When validating a new market or technology, it is instructive to review history as it tends to repeat itself. Most major technology breakthroughs and disruptions had a few things in common:

* A large, inefficient market, usually based on old technologies and processes, generating problems and unnecessary cost for all stakeholders.
* A new technology allowing new companies to invent new solutions that address these problems.

Some examples include improved internet technology which enabled Amazon to evolve our commerce habits from brick and mortar to digital and mobile technology innovations and evolutions that have led to Uber and Lyft transforming transportation.  The payments industry is no different. Its architecture and operations are still based on a 40-year-old physical card with a chip and limited fraud prevention capabilities. In contrast, digital technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are prompting the replacement of the old architecture with a new efficient, lower cost approach. y changes the way payments are made.

There is a huge inefficient market (the payment market) causing problems for all stakeholders. There is a technology that has the potential to fix it. Enter RocketFuel Blockchain.

RocketFuel is a new frictionless blockchain based payment solution for eCommerce merchants to accept payments in crypto or cash via bank transfer and receive payment and shipping information in one one-click transaction without the need for payment intermediaries. In anticipation of a major proliferation in crypto utilization for payments and business, large eCommerce and retail merchants now accept crypto as a payment method. In fact, over one-third of all small and medium-sized U.S. companies already accept Bitcoin as a B2B payment source.

The eCommerce space is estimated to be $3.5T, yet it represents less than 15% of total commerce. PayPal, a significant player in the online payments arena with over 350M users, allowed users to buy and sell crypto and just announced its “Checkout for Crypto” feature. This function, allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. In our view, this is a validation of the RocketFuel approach and will likely capture its share of this function. Still, since it lacks the 1-click convenience and appears to still be clunky and expensive relative to our forecast of the RocketFuel pricing, RocketFuel remains in the driver’s seat.

As mentioned above, existing solutions are costly, impact conversion, not secure, leads to fraud, and will eventually go the way of the milkman. Merchants and consumers alike crave security, convenience, transparency, low cost and trust.  

***The*** ***RocketFuel*** ***Approach***

The Company provides check-out and payment systems directly on the check-out page that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. The check-out systems are designed to enhance customers’ data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, the check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant.

They also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.

Data is key and the merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the funds received by the merchant from the different currencies.

Customers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are able to connect to multiple exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini and others to pay directly from them. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to connect with multiple bank accounts to pay from as well.

📷The “single-click” RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The payment user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms.

Cryptocurrencies are stored in different types of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets can include mobile wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and exchange wallets. Currently, it can be a difficult, confusing and multi-step process to use these wallets to make cryptocurrency payments. With RocketFuel’s blockchain solution, cryptocurrency holders can use any of the above digital wallets to make payment for products or services to any RocketFuel merchant with 1, 2, or 3 steps.

Using the “single-click” RocketFuel check-out technology and check-out button, consumers will no longer be re-directed to a third-party  With the RocketFuel solution, eCommerce merchants will need no contact or other information exchange with the consumer in order to receive their payment or shipping details. Instead, they will have immediate visibility of payments from customers via the RocketFuel payment system, which may be integrated into merchants’ fulfillment centers.

Looking ahead, the technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, under a future version of the payment system, advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded will be able to be placed on third party websites and sales may be completely finalized there. Thus, the platform will enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. This prospective feature is unlike any other currently in use today and could eventually be a significant driver of revenue, once completed. Such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions.

In addition to potential competition from PayPal, the primary competitor remains Bitpay, which is already well established as the leading crypto payment technology in the market, having been founded in 2011. Given that RocketFuel offers a better user experience for crypto payments, allows payment from dozens of other cryptocurrencies, and other wallets, and exchanges, RocketFuel’s diversity is a major strength.  RocketFuel also offers services that Bitpay currently does not, such as providing merchants immediate visibility of payment transactions, real time metrics of transactions and customers, easy integration to ecommerce checkout as well as deep integration to backend platforms. Furthermore, with an average of 72,000 transactions per month, it will not take significant merchant penetration for RocketFuel to surpass Bitpay, in our view.

***Target Markets*** 

The Company’s initial target market is the travel industry and RockeFuel already has signed up two sizable customers: Sky Tours and Military Fares. It should be noted that worldwide sales of flight tickets sold online in 2019 was $540B and the 2 largest reservations systems generate more than $10B in yearly revenue, making this vertical a hot commodity. Management plans to target travel merchant and web platforms. Given the complexity of the intermediaries and reservation systems, high costs and notoriously delayed payments, the RocketFuel solution can simplify the payment process and customers no longer have to provide sensitive information. We believe other verticals such as online gambling, the procurement of gift cards, and high-ticket items could prove to be lucrative for the Company. As a result, we expect sales and marketing headcount to rise over the next 12-18 months, in conjunction with rapid deployment and implementation of existing and future solutions.

**FINANCIAL FORECASTS**

*(Analyst’s Note: These forecasts are our own and we did not receive guidance or projections from RKFL management.)*

Our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be in the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.

To simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for FY22E or Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) as management begins meaningful sales and marketing expenses to build awareness and execute merchant signups in key verticals such as the travel industry and online gambling. 

In FY23E, we forecast significant revenue growth with top line reaching the $12M mark. Total operating expenses are estimated to reach $8.25M with expanded sales and marketing expenses, along with R&D, reflecting upgrades to the core functionality. Based on this model, net profit is slated to reach $650K, or $0.02, with a slight rise in shares outstanding to reflect a modest fundraise in conjunction with a prospective up-list to NASDAQ. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.

It should be noted that while there are not material direct COGS, we have allocated some indirect expenses to arrive at a gross margin of around 72-73% for all years. We believe that this is conservative and may have to be adjusted higher, thereby raising profitability and our price target.

**RISK FACTORS**

In our view, the Company’s biggest risks are straightforward: the timing and magnitude of broad adoption of its core technology and applications by both merchants and consumers. Secondary risks include changes in the regulatory environment affecting utilization along with marketing effectiveness. Competitive risks include lower pricing, more effective sales/marketing, greater functionality and features. The aforementioned risks could come from larger competitors, existing firms, or new entrants. Still, these future concerns are consistent with firms of RocketFuel’s size and early mover standing. Moreover, we believe that the Company’s seasoned management team is prepared to overcome these hurdles and generate significant top-line growth, deployment and  implementations.

Volatility and liquidity are typical concerns for microcap stocks that trade on the over the counter (OTC) stock market. In addition to a recent funding access announcement regarding Triton Funds, management may seek to raise additional capital next year in conjunction with an up-list to NASDAQ, to fund corporate expansion and potential M&A. An overriding financial benefit as a public company is the favorable access to and the availability of capital to fund product launches, consistent marketing campaigns and other initiatives. Since the proceeds of any future funding would be used in large part to advance major business development and sales, we believe that any dilutive effect from such a funding could be offset by related increases in market value.

**VALUATION AND CONCLUSION**

RKFL is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and 40+ other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RKFL is the first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless one-click checkout experience. The market is huge and growing at an enviable rate. According to Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.

Current eCommerce methods are outdated, problematic, and costly, while the Company’s platform is designed to improve the merchant and customer experience. Implementation should lead to lower merchant costs, potential recurring business and may foster customer loyalty. 

Management has a proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies. Thus, we envision RKFL emerging as a takeover candidate. At present, our forecasts suggest sales will jump from $1.8M to $40M in 3 years, with meaningful EPS. Stocks tend to generate their greatest gains when the transition from early adoption to mass market appeal begins, which could begin in late 2021.

Given the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.

***The View from 30,000 Feet***

Blockchain payments innovator **RocketFuel** **Blockchain, Inc. (OTCQB – RKFL)** is poised to transform the global eCommerce industry, in our view. The Company is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and dozens of other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RocketFuel is the first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless and elegant one-click checkout experience that today's digital and mobile-centric consumers have come to expect from eCommerce marketplaces, such as **Amazon (NASDAQ – AMZN)**. 

The RocketFuel platform, based on patent-pending technology, enables merchants and consumers to easily complete payment for goods and services using 43 different cryptocurrencies or direct bank transfer in a completely secure environment. A significant benefit of the Company’s approach is that the entire shopping cart checkout process can be executed via a distributed ledger or blockchain. Thus, merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex, and costly payment and check-out infrastructures. With the one-click checkout used on RocketFuel-partnered sites, consumers will enjoy unrivalled convenience .

As is typically the case with new technologies and applications with a broad scope, we expect early adopters to dominate usage during 2021 as online merchants shopping cart and payment solutions providers implement the crypto acceptance functionality, with mass market utilization occurring in 2022. With estimates suggesting that the number of (non-Facebook) crypto wallet holders will grow to 250M+ in the next 2-3 years, up from 68M today, substantial adoption lies ahead.   

***The Problem***

eCommerce has enjoyed wide, mainstream adoption and in many cases has emerged as the shopping method of choice for consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, for merchants and consumers alike, many of the payment system setups and associated technologies in place today have underlying issues, which in turn have a deleterious effect on merchant/consumer transaction execution.

For consumers, payment systems and shopping cart utilization can be awkward and clunky, require multiple steps and redirects to 3rd parties, and may not be secure, resulting in a less than stellar customer experience. For merchants, the current eCommerce payment infrastructure is even more problematic. In most cases, merchants are required to use an intermediary, costing billions in excess expenses annually. Roughly 1 in 5 carts leave without completing a transaction because consumers do not trust the merchant’s system. Plus, in most cases, fees are high, payments are delayed, and exorbitant fees due to fraud, fraud prevention, and chargebacks related to the inefficient back-end operations can be excessive, reducing profits.

***The Solution*** 

In contrast, by leveraging modern blockchain technology and its proprietary platform, RocketFuel offers consumers a single-click pay solution, pay with crypto or direct bank transfer option with no redirects or filling out forms as the information is stored at once. The process is seamless-simple, efficient, secure, and convenient. Merchants generate higher shopping cart conversion, pay lower fees, have greater security, transparency, less fraud, and improved cash flow. With a better experience for both sides of the transaction, and improved order and shipping fulfillment, merchants can foster loyalty and generate recurring business. 

***Today and Tomorrow***

The Company launched its first product in a live environment in March 2021 and with two travel merchant customers and a tax auditing firm in hand, management intends to continue to develop the check-out technology with several larger U.S. eCommerce merchants, social media and blogsites. With connections to several larger eCommerce merchants, near term sales and marketing efforts will focus on a few “big fish” rather than many smaller merchants and will scale up initiatives as funding permits. We believe that the Company will also target specific verticals that may be a source of early adopters and crypto wallet holders in verticals such as online gambling, gaming, and with merchants selling high ticket items. In conjunction with this targeted approach, RocketFuel may utilize social media to generate awareness and attract consumer influencers. Given that the phase from early adoption to mass market adoption can take 12-18 months, we believe that the Company could enjoy exponential merchant sign-ups going forward, along with consumer utilization, from 2021-2022, with the greatest recurring platform utilization by consumers beginning in 2023. 

***Financial Forecasts and Valuation***

It is difficult to accurately project the deployment and adoption success of a new technology and application such as the unique RocketFuel blockchain and crypto payment service.  However, given the underlying growth rates in blockchain ledger utilization for financial and payment transactions, as well as the proliferation of crypto wallet adoption, it is clear that major upside exists. Widespread adoption and growth are further affirmed by the Company’s underlying offering which solves major unmet needs in eCommerce for merchants and consumers alike. As with many young companies, it comes down to efficient execution. The management has a strong, proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies.

We should note that our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to firmly estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.

To simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) and revenue of $12M in FY23E with net profit of $650K, or $0.02. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.

Given the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.

Finally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel’s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management’s capabilities.

**INDUSTRY PRIMER: BLOCKCHAIN**

📷

According to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.

A blockchain, also known as a “distributed ledger technology,” is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records used to secure transactions across multiple devices that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible.

Transactions in money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be implemented and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and sophisticated code---without intermediaries. Given the opportunities associated with such a disruptive technology, many firms in varied industries are actively operating in the space to transact business, agreements and financial transactions more efficiently.

Commercial and central banks across the world are now using blockchain technology for payment processing and issuing of their digital currencies. The technology enables cross-border payments that are less expensive and faster as compared to traditional systems. The remittance cost within the blockchain is 2% to 3% of the total amount as compared to other third parties as blockchain does not require third-party authentication. Even governments are introducing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) to replace cash and traditional fiat-currencies. Plus, they are putting social media behemoths such as Facebook and Google under scrutiny for their lack of privacy protection and data security.

One of the most popular applications of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Trading in cryptocurrency is relatively easy compared to other assets. You can begin trading just by signing up for various wallets on the market. Furthermore, there are different types of wallet apps, each with its own advantages, such as levels of security, accessibility, and more. The most popular and well-known wallet is Coinbase with 639,885 daily active users (DAUs). If Facebook’s Libra initiative to its 2B users is successful, this figure will be dwarfed in short order.

The payments segment dominated the market in 2020 and accounted for more than 44.0% share of the global revenue. Blockchain technology improves payment system efficiency, minimizes operating costs, and offers transparency. These benefits provided by blockchain technology are increasing its use in payment solutions, thus, driving the segment growth. At the same time, blockchain reduces the need for middlemen in payment processing, which is also a major factor driving the segment growth.

Bitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) is the most popular application of blockchain, but increasingly this innovative technology can be used in various business and commercial purposes. The elimination of the middleman in various transactions and processes promises a much more efficient workflow using blockchain. Additionally, increasing concerns about privacy and security make blockchain an ideal technological pipeline for modern processes.

Enter the eCommerce application.

**ROCKETFUEL: THE GAME-CHANGER**

When validating a new market or technology, it is instructive to review history as it tends to repeat itself. Most major technology breakthroughs and disruptions had a few things in common:

* A large, inefficient market, usually based on old technologies and processes, generating problems and unnecessary cost for all stakeholders.
* A new technology allowing new companies to invent new solutions that address these problems.

Some examples include improved internet technology which enabled Amazon to evolve our commerce habits from brick and mortar to digital and mobile technology innovations and evolutions that have led to Uber and Lyft transforming transportation.  The payments industry is no different. Its architecture and operations are still based on a 40-year-old physical card with a chip and limited fraud prevention capabilities. In contrast, digital technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are prompting the replacement of the old architecture with a new efficient, lower cost approach. y changes the way payments are made.

There is a huge inefficient market (the payment market) causing problems for all stakeholders. There is a technology that has the potential to fix it. Enter RocketFuel Blockchain.

RocketFuel is a new frictionless blockchain based payment solution for eCommerce merchants to accept payments in crypto or cash via bank transfer and receive payment and shipping information in one one-click transaction without the need for payment intermediaries. In anticipation of a major proliferation in crypto utilization for payments and business, large eCommerce and retail merchants now accept crypto as a payment method. In fact, over one-third of all small and medium-sized U.S. companies already accept Bitcoin as a B2B payment source.

The eCommerce space is estimated to be $3.5T, yet it represents less than 15% of total commerce. PayPal, a significant player in the online payments arena with over 350M users, allowed users to buy and sell crypto and just announced its “Checkout for Crypto” feature. This function, allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. In our view, this is a validation of the RocketFuel approach and will likely capture its share of this function. Still, since it lacks the 1-click convenience and appears to still be clunky and expensive relative to our forecast of the RocketFuel pricing, RocketFuel remains in the driver’s seat.

As mentioned above, existing solutions are costly, impact conversion, not secure, leads to fraud, and will eventually go the way of the milkman. Merchants and consumers alike crave security, convenience, transparency, low cost and trust.  

***The*** ***RocketFuel*** ***Approach***

The Company provides check-out and payment systems directly on the check-out page that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. The check-out systems are designed to enhance customers’ data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, the check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant.

They also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.

Data is key and the merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the funds received by the merchant from the different currencies.

Customers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are able to connect to multiple exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini and others to pay directly from them. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to connect with multiple bank accounts to pay from as well.

📷The “single-click” RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The payment user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms.

Cryptocurrencies are stored in different types of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets can include mobile wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and exchange wallets. Currently, it can be a difficult, confusing and multi-step process to use these wallets to make cryptocurrency payments. With RocketFuel’s blockchain solution, cryptocurrency holders can use any of the above digital wallets to make payment for products or services to any RocketFuel merchant with 1, 2, or 3 steps.

Using the “single-click” RocketFuel check-out technology and check-out button, consumers will no longer be re-directed to a third-party  With the RocketFuel solution, eCommerce merchants will need no contact or other information exchange with the consumer in order to receive their payment or shipping details. Instead, they will have immediate visibility of payments from customers via the RocketFuel payment system, which may be integrated into merchants’ fulfillment centers.

Looking ahead, the technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, under a future version of the payment system, advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded will be able to be placed on third party websites and sales may be completely finalized there. Thus, the platform will enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. This prospective feature is unlike any other currently in use today and could eventually be a significant driver of revenue, once completed. Such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions.

In addition to potential competition from PayPal, the primary competitor remains Bitpay, which is already well established as the leading crypto payment technology in the market, having been founded in 2011. Given that RocketFuel offers a better user experience for crypto payments, allows payment from dozens of other cryptocurrencies, and other wallets, and exchanges, RocketFuel’s diversity is a major strength.  RocketFuel also offers services that Bitpay currently does not, such as providing merchants immediate visibility of payment transactions, real time metrics of transactions and customers, easy integration to ecommerce checkout as well as deep integration to backend platforms. Furthermore, with an average of 72,000 transactions per month, it will not take significant merchant penetration for RocketFuel to surpass Bitpay, in our view.

***Target Markets*** 

The Company’s initial target market is the travel industry and RockeFuel already has signed up two sizable customers: Sky Tours and Military Fares. It should be noted that worldwide sales of flight tickets sold online in 2019 was $540B and the 2 largest reservations systems generate more than $10B in yearly revenue, making this vertical a hot commodity. Management plans to target travel merchant and web platforms. Given the complexity of the intermediaries and reservation systems, high costs and notoriously delayed payments, the RocketFuel solution can simplify the payment process and customers no longer have to provide sensitive information. We believe other verticals such as online gambling, the procurement of gift cards, and high-ticket items could prove to be lucrative for the Company. As a result, we expect sales and marketing headcount to rise over the next 12-18 months, in conjunction with rapid deployment and implementation of existing and future solutions.

**FINANCIAL FORECASTS**

*(Analyst’s Note: These forecasts are our own and we did not receive guidance or projections from RKFL management.)*

Our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be in the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.

To simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for FY22E or Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) as management begins meaningful sales and marketing expenses to build awareness and execute merchant signups in key verticals such as the travel industry and online gambling. 

In FY23E, we forecast significant revenue growth with top line reaching the $12M mark. Total operating expenses are estimated to reach $8.25M with expanded sales and marketing expenses, along with R&D, reflecting upgrades to the core functionality. Based on this model, net profit is slated to reach $650K, or $0.02, with a slight rise in shares outstanding to reflect a modest fundraise in conjunction with a prospective up-list to NASDAQ. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.

It should be noted that while there are not material direct COGS, we have allocated some indirect expenses to arrive at a gross margin of around 72-73% for all years. We believe that this is conservative and may have to be adjusted higher, thereby raising profitability and our price target.

**RISK FACTORS**

In our view, the Company’s biggest risks are straightforward: the timing and magnitude of broad adoption of its core technology and applications by both merchants and consumers. Secondary risks include changes in the regulatory environment affecting utilization along with marketing effectiveness. Competitive risks include lower pricing, more effective sales/marketing, greater functionality and features. The aforementioned risks could come from larger competitors, existing firms, or new entrants. Still, these future concerns are consistent with firms of RocketFuel’s size and early mover standing. Moreover, we believe that the Company’s seasoned management team is prepared to overcome these hurdles and generate significant top-line growth, deployment and  implementations.

Volatility and liquidity are typical concerns for microcap stocks that trade on the over the counter (OTC) stock market. In addition to a recent funding access announcement regarding Triton Funds, management may seek to raise additional capital next year in conjunction with an up-list to NASDAQ, to fund corporate expansion and potential M&A. An overriding financial benefit as a public company is the favorable access to and the availability of capital to fund product launches, consistent marketing campaigns and other initiatives. Since the proceeds of any future funding would be used in large part to advance major business development and sales, we believe that any dilutive effect from such a funding could be offset by related increases in market value.

**VALUATION AND CONCLUSION**

RKFL is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and 40+ other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RKFL is the first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless one-click checkout experience. The market is huge and growing at an enviable rate. According to Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.

Current eCommerce methods are outdated, problematic, and costly, while the Company’s platform is designed to improve the merchant and customer experience. Implementation should lead to lower merchant costs, potential recurring business and may foster customer loyalty. 

Management has a proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies. Thus, we envision RKFL emerging as a takeover candidate. At present, our forecasts suggest sales will jump from $1.8M to $40M in 3 years, with meaningful EPS. Stocks tend to generate their greatest gains when the transition from early adoption to mass market appeal begins, which could begin in late 2021.

Given the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.

Finally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel’s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management’s capabilities.",2021-04-08,14,5

mfvovp_MS,MS,What Morgan Stanley's offering of RKT 20m share block at $25.25 means,"MS is liquidating stocks to recover capital, including a 20m share block of RKT. Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25. They know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Short interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade - which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value (above $25.25)

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.

Edit: apparently the shares are already sold out now

I am currently trading 1 share at a time. This is to keep risk low as I am still learning the ropes. Eventually my plan is to work up to around 100 share lot size, and I like to pretend that I am trading with real size to keep it as realistic as possible.

The morning started off really well with 2 great trades

**UPST**

Gapping up on a strong earnings report. This gap was very big and so I was very cautious. However, it opened up very strong with a clear long bias. It consolidated right around pre-market highs and formed a clean flag pattern. I got in at $91.22 and it immediately pushed up a couple points which I will immediately take. Out at $93.14 for a gain of $1.92. This went on to go higher with additional setups, but it was so overextended I was not interested in trading it any more

**PDD**

Has been gapping down several days in a row and I have had success with it the last couple of days. It seems a little over sold to me, but it has a history of making big moves and it was trading above yesterdays low and the nearest support on the daily. It had a clear trend downward and formed a nice flat consolidation. I was in short at the break lower at $141.94 and out at $140.94 for a quick $1.00 profit.

From here I was well past my daily goal of $2.00, and I should have just left my desk. If I was trading with full size, I may have continued to trade with half or quarter size, but I am unable to do that with single shares. I may just decide to switch over to paper trading in the future. So I can continue to practice, but not give back profits as my success always tends to drop the longer into the day we go. I also was aware that markets were choppy and at the very least should have waited for a clear direction before taking any more trades.

**BABA**

I was looking for the break of low-of-day, but this setup was dog shit and I had no business taking it. I regretted it the moment I hit buy and I got out immediately. Lost $0.19

**RCL**

Basically the same as above. It did break low-of-day, but given how RCL moves the risk/reward just wasn't worth it. Lost $0.14

&#x200B;

**WSM**

Gapping up on earnings. I was looking for the high of day break. I am okay with this trade as I was right, but too early. WSM was really wippy and I should have recognized that and just avoided it. Lost $0.31

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/udq86zjcjtn61.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=83eab3959d0d0c4af2abcad70ff243f536394c37

**DKNG**

I like DKNG  and will generally check in on it every day. This was a high of day break off of 2 previous pivots. I am okay with this setup and I tried to give it room too work. SPY had just broken high of day as well and I was optimistic, but it broke too low before making the move higher. Again, I was right but early. Still it was choppy and never made a clean move. So in hindsight the risk/reward wasn't worth it. Lost $0.24.

&#x200B;

**Summary**

Total of 6 trades. 2 winners, 4 losers. Total profit of $2.04 which is just above my goal. So I am happy. I prefer to have a higher win rate, but it is still clear to me that my strategy is reliant on keeping losses small which I accomplished today.

I still need to work on taking good setups and working with the trend to avoid getting chopped up on mornings like today.

**Missed Opportunities**

Part of taking good trades is identifying stocks and sectors that are trending. Finance opened really strong today. Both GS and JPM are on my main list of stocks and provided several good setups. However, I missed them in my screening this morning and wasn't watching them. So I need to try to be more thorough and not miss good opportunities.

CHICAGO, IL, Feb. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [via NewMediaWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=np_E8qfkIc6C2vxTnbcbdnLri2XzRRmk5Q1NNFeQi6JvKTD3L5SFO8zpzqEX2WQEZJ4rg_nGbIZolvfWy1DeM2E7nCcHhVOvIyPzyOMg15o=) \-- [Epazz, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bmhv7fQ8fpHgQFJz12PY7PYKK063fsLOCkUx9xPttVTNnehclLdvN-Css5RF2B1VyCPbTpwKBgg4R1oOlPLQyw==). (OTC: EPAZ), a provider of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency mobile apps, smart contracts, and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company is developing the Greenheart DeFi mobile application to trade Greenheart Punt tokens as the first distributed application (dApp) marketplace for Cannabidiol (CBD) oils products.

[Greenheart CBD](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=S9U2CNGAEpsCa2oZXRJFZ72kQjk3qRO1YtgOQomkZWUzcrhjfmCDahIhqoPeObyHsGVMK9MPiT9eNlpCcL6CAQ==) is an Irish owned company with a vision to bring the finest Irish made Cannabidiol (CBD) oils products from seed to shelf in Ireland. The company helps farmers to produce the best organic hemp crops and process them through cold press extraction machinery in the most natural way possible. The company has spent years researching extraction methods with full traceability from seed to shelf. It aims to create standardized cold-press extraction procedures and create the most effective CBD products for the end consumer. 

Shaun Passley, Ph.D., CEO, and Chairman of Epazz, Inc., said in a comment: ***""What differentiates Greenheart Punt tokens from other tokens and cryptocurrencies is its sustainability. Greenheart CBD hemp company is profitable and revenue-producing.

The company uses the industry-leading decentralized platform ""*Origin*."" It enables token investors to use the platform to purchase Greenheart CBD products using Ethereum or the Greenheart Punt tokens. The dApp marketplace is now live and the company has issued the Greenheart Punt token to expand its scope to the CBD community, by offering its token holders a cost-effective and operationally efficient way to access the growing range of Greenheart CBD products.

The Greenheart mobile app will allow token holders to use their tokens to purchase current and future CBD products. Additionally, more Greenheart CBD Punt token holders mean rapid growth of the token community, allowing for developing advanced technology across its production process including AI, drone technology, and Big Data capabilities and analytics.  It also enables easy payment processing using secure blockchain technology.

**Epazz Releases Alpha Version of StreamPay Supply Chain Risk Monitoring and Payment Tracking Solution Using Blockchain Smart Contract Technology to Trace Raw Materials to Finished Goods** Press Release | 01/26/2021

**We will start the process of attracting beta customers to the solution for general release later this year**

CHICAGO, Jan. 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via [NewMediaWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5vXt7-7mj92njf_meBeka3fS06SDJwWPOrVzGXi3GY2latBRSIFt4sPWD6FlQvqvUsIEpHKWRxfXBgdM0QOp_ulMep54j46hOn02_NnACxw=) \-- [Epazz Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fb5XPbhKd3ScBapDt7iXxmf3f9G7hObsvIQQu9tinKKoefav7o8eK_Rm7PA5jZsQzFiKklcd2yyHs_RuvjTWmg==). (O.T.C.: EPAZ), a provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company is releasing an alpha version of its app to attract beta customers to its StreamPay service app. StreamPay is a solution for managers to monitor their supply chain for risk fraud using blockchain smart contract technology to trace raw materials to finished goods. Please visit [https://www.streampay.io](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RoGnlo07cdXVGJhA3GyZUVdjUsyXsXC_ruIJUvcCPIwyOB7h8xXBN4IxGIUffvuP8uSBeFZdHfWagQDBSCpYd_EgKsKZNTtxYOEPzHmNTvk=)

Companies’ supply chains are now global, and they depend on the global supply chain to deliver goods and services to their end customers. Many companies spend millions of U.S. dollars a year to maximize their supply chain to deliver increased profits to shareholders. Companies are looking for ways to better manage their logistics processes, transportation, inventory management, and quality assurance. Having a response-based business model is the practice of keeping low inventory to respond to changes in the marketplace. This model helps in shelving the latest products and services while reducing product returns and spoiled goods, employing the latest technology, and providing the freshest food products. This model reduces dwell time (time that finished goods are idle and provide no value). To effectively manage this responsive supply chain, companies must monitor their suppliers and share information internally and externally. The faster critical information is shared with the supply chain network, the faster problems can be prevented and resolved. Sometimes, the problem is as simple as making a payment. However, increased globalization means the increased use of local currencies. Some countries do not accept payment from some banks, while some banks restrict the forms of payment or delay funds for days or even weeks. The global supply chain requires a global payment solution that is fully integrated into the supply chain risk monitoring solution.

StreamPay is an enterprise supply chain risk monitoring and payment tracking solution that uses blockchain smart contracts to manage suppliers and finished goods. StreamPay technology keeps distributed ledgers to create articles to insert into smart contracts so supply chain manufacturers, suppliers, vendors, logistics companies, and customers can track goods and services from the raw materials to the finished product using QR codes and digital signatures.

StreamPay gives companies the ability to monitor their supply chain to determine whether it faces any risks. StreamPay features a risk index that alerts users on their dashboards to any supply chain problems that could arise. StreamPay manages quality assurance to ensure the finished goods meet the requirements the customers set. It also allows inspectors to issue certifications to suppliers and partners. Finally, StreamPay enables parties of a transaction to make policy decisions, and its smart contracts issue payments to suppliers when goods or services have been delivered, based on the terms of the smart contracts. The parties can pay in USD, euros, or cryptocurrencies, and the StreamPay wallet maintains the current local exchange rate. This provides users a worry-free payment experience, and users do not need to buy and sell cryptocurrencies to pay for small items.

Shaun Passley, Ph.D., CEO, and chairman of Epazz Inc., said, “We started the project in 2019, and it is ready to start finding beta customers to prepare the solution for general release.”

lpc46t_GS,GS,"Like $SQ and $GS, what companies are building simplicity in other industries?","As someone who is incredibly OCD, one thing I’ve always been a big fan of is simplicity. 

When I first signed up for Goldman Sachs “Marcus” app, I was impressed with the simplicity. The app is fast and sleek yet has all necessary bells and whistles. Something very “easy to use half asleep at 2 am”. You can send a one click wire. There’s a tracker that shows progress for any bonuses you’re eligible for. Their investment in simplicity compared to other, complicated apps made me move all of my savings to them, and I’d probably move my checking to them too when they launch that. 

I was recently surprised to find this again in a second company - Square’s cash app. The second I opened it for the first time, I likened it to a “fisher price app” - super simple to use, super simple to understand, clean interface - yet powerful.

I unfortunately can’t find a link to an article I read recently, but it showed that people are experiencing app overload and prefer 8-10 apps ... no more. I believe this trend towards simplicity will continue and would like to factor it into my investment decisions moving forward (for my “play” account).

 A few weeks ago he recommends buying fuel cell FCEL, the companies never earned a penny it's had a number of reverse splits the number of shares outstanding has increased so much that the losses per share look like ""less"".  
 Either way it looks like he's dumping fuel cell now and now he's recommending buying riot blockchain RIOT.  
 Riot blockchain CEO was on CNBC last night defending the pump and dump that the past predecessors did back in 2017 on Riot blockchain when it had far less shares outstanding.  
 Now with all these extra shares they've issued the company stock is worth way more than it was back then when they did the last pump and dump scheme.  
 The CEO Admitted those past criminals that ran Riot are no longer at the company.  
 Then he said they just purchased a lot of machines to mine for cryptocurrencies, they're not sitting on a horde of cryptocurrencies like John said they were fraudulently on CNBC they haven't even started mining yet.  
 How do people get away with that kind of stuff this bald bombastic x jock is getting people to buy these horrible companies with no earnings and no path to earnings anytime soon. Then he dumps his options and bombastically tells you to buy something else that he'll make a profit on in the future  leaving the little guy like us holding the bag.  
 You know this stuff does not happen at bottoms guys.  
 Now what do we do?

This aint the Scwhag from ur bros worse friend Elmer 'The Goose Man' Drexler. $LVVV is Premium Pot - Premium Ambitions - San Luis Obispo land, organic, tractor free till w over 150,000 sq foot canopy! I see much of Robert Mondavi's story in $LVVV - light it up","# 'Mondavi of Marijuana?'

The Mondavi family entered wine early, crafted an experience & Brand. $LVVV is 'Weedery' -  sounds nuts/stupid? Good. If u told investors 30 yrs ago that peeps pay  $25 to taste 3 wines in Napa, they would laugh! $LVVV targets $50MM in Revenue upon project completion.

HERE WE GO BOYS - Lets get this started...

I purchase the following Over the Counter:

* Tampons (with coupons)
* Selsun Blue (I have dandruff re penny stock stress)
* Last minute Wine Coolers

I also buy stocks OTC. As such...

I am all in $LVVV. I purchased shares at .008. I am holding. I see so much of [Robert Mondavi](https://www.winespectator.com/anniversary/leaders/id/Mondavi-family)  in this company. Do you realize that Mondavi has a wine tasting room  for its premium Opus One brand that STARTS at $125 per person? My dad is  blue collar. When I told him this, he looked at me w a disgust usually retained for me. As such, he was disgusted.$LVVV  is operating with Mondavi like vision - its setting out for a premium  marijuana crop. Who the hell buys land super expensive land in San Luis  Obispo California, gets a license from the county (state pending) and opens up a Weedery?

FACTS on the COMPANY:

* $LVV is creating what the chairman and CEO, Mr. Bill Hodson calls the 'world’s first Estate Grown Weedery '
* $LVVV  will pioneer 'regenerative cannabis tractor-less farming  for the  cultivation of organic, medicinal, and recreational cannabis in California.' Wow. That is deep. Really big & Deep.
* Location,  location, location:  Owns '150,000sf of canopy, multiple buildings,  supported with ample power and sufficient water supply from multiple  onsite wells.' As such, the farm is ready.
* County has provided the green light
* State  of California license is pending. California loves pot. Seriously. I  wager a catalyst for $LVVV is the state giving the license. Just a thought for your trek to Alpha Centauri.
* Expects $50MM in revenue from this voyage.

$LVVV has a passionate leader who wrote a very unusual (in the sense of its candid nature) letter to the shareholders:

OriginTrail (TRAC) is IMHO one of the most promising and real world projects in the Crypto space. They are working to become the multi-chain supply chain agnostic protocol, have numerous partnerships with world wide operating S&P 500 companies and are one of the infrastructure projects in the Polkadot ecosystem.

OriginTrail is a neutral, open-source protocol enabling data sharing between companies and organizations. It utilizes decentralized nodes and an off-chain technology stack to interface with legacy systems as well as other blockchains (permissioned and permissionless). OriginTrail allows businesses to improve interoperability among systems and facilitate trusted data exchange. Trust between parties is achieved using the \*\*OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN),\*\* which has been up and running since December 2018. The permissionless OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) relies on an off-chain technology stack consisting of several inter-related layers. At its core is a decentralized network of data providers, data creators, data holders, and data viewers.

lfuck2_SQ,SQ,What are your thoughts on SQ share price being tied to bitcoin?,"This past month SQ share price has tracked nearly identical to the fluctuations of bitcoin. For example, both dropped to their monthly low on 1/27 and had a sharp spike to all time highs today. I am (was?) very bullish on SQ based on the theory that post-COVID, they can generate more revenue from small business + it's possible they could be added to the S&P500 sometime in the future...but as of recently, I do not like how the share price of SQ is tracking with bitcoin.

l4o72d_PATH,PATH,MATIC NETWORK- The Answer For Blockchain Scaling Solutions,"MATIC NETWORK- The Answer For Blockchain Scaling Solutions

Matic Network is a Layer 2 blockchain solution that accomplishes scale by using sidechains for off-chain computations while guaranteeing resource security utilizing the Plasma system and a decentralized organization of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators. 

Why Matic?

Since the coming of Decentralized apps (Dapps) into existence, there has been huge progress in blockchain as a whole but there is a setback as currently, blockchain can't scale.

Slow transaction rates and ridiculously high amounts of transaction fees otherwise known as gas fees are some major setbacks of blockchain gaining mass adoption by mainstream users. And also there is a problem of UX(user experience) as users who are not familiar with the blockchain out there don't get the best of it.

Matic's aim is focused on changing these problems encountered in blockchain utilization and hopefully develop an easy interaction between users and the decentralized world eliminating the worry of a complex blockchain system.

Matic endeavors to settle scalability as well as usability issues encountered in the blockchain ecosystem without compromising decentralization and leveraging the current developer network and ecosystem. Matic Network is an ​off/side chain scaling answer for existing platforms to give versatility and better user experience than DApps/user functionalities.


Features Of Matic Network

•Scalability
•High Throughput
•User Experience
•Security
•Asset Interoperability

Scalability: Matic network is easily adaptable with noteworthy futures of; fast speed, low gas fees, easy and secured transactions on Matic side chains with certainty accomplished on mainchain and Ethereum as the primary viable Layer 1 base chain 

High Throughput: Can scale up to millions on a side chain tree architecture. Achieved up to 10,000 TPS on a solitary sidechain on inward testnet; Multiple chains to be added for horizontal scaling 

User Experience: Smooth UX and developer reflection from mainchain to Matic chain; native mobile applications and SDK with WalletConnect uphold 

Security: Matic chain administrators are themselves stakers in the PoS system.

Public Sidechains: Matic sidechains are public (versus individual DApp chains), permissionless, and equipped for supporting different protocols. 

Asset Interoperability: Assets on different sidechains across various blockchains will be made inter-operable by Matic Network soon.

Toolbox for Developers 

Matic encourages developers intending to utilize the matic chain to scale their Decentralized applications (DApps) greatly. Developers are allowed to utilize their tokens as settlement charges to run the Network. It gives SDKs and APIs a quick and simple turn of events. 

Matic is easy for incorporating DApps with a couple of straightforward advances and gives users a smooth, quick, and secure user experience. Settle installment on-chain at whatever point required. 

Matic Network is a scaling answer for public blockchains. Because of an adjusted usage of Plasma system (Plasma MoreVP) - with a record based execution. Matic bolsters all the current Ethereum tooling alongside quicker and less expensive exchanges.

In Conclusion;

More than 70 dApps have been built on Matic, ranging from DeFi protocols to games and prediction markets. With more validator nodes being onboarded on the Matic Network progressively, it is on the path to full decentralization and becoming the most sought after Layer 2 network in the blockchain ecosystem.",2021-01-25,3,1
kxae5y_SQ,SQ,CCTL - CoinCitadel - Undervalued Bitcoin/Blockchain Miner,"Been taking note of Bitcoin's run over the past year, and especially the past few months? Have you heard that large investment banks are buying into bitcoin now as they view it as something much more substantial than a project? Citi is calling for bitcoin to reach over $300,000 by the end of THIS YEAR?

We've all likely heard of well-known names in the space like MSTR, SQ and other large holders. There are companies that offer services around bitcoin/blockchain likely hosting companies, trading/investment firms and so on. Then there are the miners - the people & companies that do the hard work of solving equations to earn bitcoin.

There are only a handful of publicly traded miners out there. Some of the more well known tickers are MARA, RIOT and BTBT.

From my research, on the OTC there are several that are in the mining space directly.

* ARBKF (Argo Blockchain) - $1.68
* BFCH (BitFrontier Capital Holdings) - $0.046
* BTGN (Bitcoin Generation) - $0.54
* CBTC (XTRA Bitcoin) - $0.0082
* NODC (NodeChain) - $0.10
* MGTI (MGT Capital Investments) - $0.24
* SNLP (Syntrol Corp) - $0.02

The one I am focusing on with this post is **CCTL (CoinCitadel)**, based in the United States. Its share price is $0.0042 (at the time of writing).

CCTL is in my view not only the lowest priced security of the group but also represents the best value. It therefore provides the opportunity for the most upside. My thesis below.

**Point #1: Bitcoin holdings are severely undervalued.**

They have confirmed that they own 576 bitcoin in their treasury.

https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/d4d08b7b-b695-4529-9b23-a416a869ee7d/downloads/cctl%20dec%202105%20qtrly%20report.pdf

At today's price of roughly $39,000 per bitcoin that equates to a value of $22.5 million. The market cap of CCTL as of yesterday is $13.5 million. That is a gap of $6 million just to get to parity to its store of bitcoin, suggesting the stock should be *at least* $.006 (50% higher) on this point alone.

Obviously, if you believe that BTC is going to be 10x higher than currently by the end of the year then the company’s market cap should move in tandem.

Additionally, there may be more bitcoin in the treasury than the 576. They are actively looking for more...

""New management will do its best to find any dormant Bitcoin address or Private Keys to any lost Bitcoin if their existence  can be validated. We will also work on obtaining any Bitcoin due to the company from any previous stock deals arranged by the former CEO's if payment was rendered and verified Bitcoin addresses and private keys were not received.""

[https://coincitadel.net/financials](https://coincitadel.net/financials)

**Point #2: Valuation beyond treasury holdings is obviously very far behind peers.**

If the market isn't valuing their bitcoin holdings properly then there is no way the stock could be even close to its peers from a valuation perspective!

The company has stated that it owns ""a few hundred"" ASIC miners that mine primarily bitcoin along with other crytocurrencies (see the ""2019 Financials"" report on [https://coincitadel.net/financials](https://coincitadel.net/financials)). It hosted about 1000 miners from other companies with co-location but intends to over time run solely its own machines.

The total hashrate of its miners and the current number of miners is the subject of speculation the mere fact that they continue to mine would put the share price higher than simply the value of the BTC in the treasury. How much of a premium should be placed? It's hard to say but the market cap should reflect some kind of premium. Surely, this should put the stock price at significantly more than $0.006.

**Point #3: They have extremely low electricity costs.**

Electricity costs are the most important cost consideration for any bitcoin miner. As such it is a critical part of operations and profitability, especially as it gets more difficult to mine bitcoin.
CCTL is located in Plattsburgh, NY. Plattsburgh claims to have the lowest electricity rates in the country and possibly the world. That is due to a hydroelectric dam on the St. Lawrence river. Residents pay an extremely low rate and industrial concerns such as CCTL pay even less. This means that CCTL's mining profitability should be high, all else equal.

Interestingly new miners were temporarily banned from operating in the city or expanding operations if they currently existed in March 2018 due to their heavy power consumption but that ban ended in February 2019. Some fascinating reads & videos:

It seems as though the city wants to work with miners.

**Point #4. The company has stated it will become current with filings!**

The stock is currently on the Pink Sheets with a status of ""Pink No Information.""

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CCTL/profile](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CCTL/profile)

The last financial filing was the annual report for calendar 2015. That was on 2016.

However, on their website they recently updated their financials page. On this page they have indicated that they are planning to be “current and reporting” in 2021:

""Despite being a Pink non reporting company, Coin Citadel has posted 2017, 2018 and 2019 unaudited financials are below. 2021 Coin Citadel will be current and reporting.""

This is absolutely huge news as it will bring legitimacy and transparency to the operation in the eyes of investors, and hopefully a platform to move up OTC tiers. Compare that to other OTC miners who have gone completely dark.

**Point #6. The company is actively disseminating corporate information.**

They are involved and looking to reassure investors!

**Point #7: The CEO is a long time bitcoiner.**

Tom Pillsworth has been in the space since at least 2014. You could say bitcoin & cryptocurrency is all he knows! You can read more about him and his impressive background in the space on the company’s “About Us” page:

[https://coincitadel.net/about](https://coincitadel.net/about)

Pillsworth became CEO in December 2018: [https://www.prlog.org/12746943-coin-citadel-announces-appointment-of-thomas-william-pillsworth-as-chief-executive-officer.html](https://www.prlog.org/12746943-coin-citadel-announces-appointment-of-thomas-william-pillsworth-as-chief-executive-officer.html)

You would definitely want a person with significant experience in the space running your operations.

**Conclusion**

In my opinion CCTL is the most undervalued, least appreciated of all bitcoin mining stocks.

They have tons going for them including extremely low costs, holdings in treasury, mining operations, deep experience and a move for greater transparency going forward.

My view is that the stock should appreciate somewhere around 10x current levels, considering the above and the expected appreciation of bitcoin throughout the year. If the froth/mania gets really out of hand then the sky is the limit.",2021-01-14,50,38

Square Has Discussed Acquiring Jay-Z’s Tidal Service
Lucas Shaw and Kurt Wagner, Bloomberg News

Jack Dorsey
Jack Dorsey , Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- Square Inc., the digital-payment company run by Jack Dorsey, has held talks to acquire the music-streaming service Tidal as part of a push to diversify, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Dorsey has discussed a potential deal with Jay-Z, the rapper and music mogul who acquired Tidal for $56 million in early 2015, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The negotiations may not result in a transaction.

Square declined to comment, while Tidal didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Tidal, which first launched in 2014, has struggled to keep pace with other streaming services, including Spotify Technology SA and Apple Music. Jay-Z’s own music has been a lure for the platform, but he put his songs back on Spotify last year -- raising questions about the health of Tidal. The closely held service hasn’t reported subscriber figures since saying it had 3 million paying customers in 2016.

Dorsey, meanwhile, has ambitions to build Square into a much broader company made up of stand-alone, complementary services. Square’s two core products, Square Seller and Cash App, already operate somewhat separately within Square Inc., each with its own “lead” on the executive team. It’s believed Dorsey, who spent more than four years on the board of Walt Disney Co., imagines Square will similarly own a collection of businesses under one corporate umbrella.

Dorsey was photographed in August in the Hamptons with Jay-Z and his wife, Beyoncé, and then again in December with the power couple and actor Sean Penn on a beach in Hawaii.

Tidal’s owners include nearly two dozen high-profile artists, including Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Coldplay, Madonna, Rihanna and others, according to its website. The service is available in 53 countries and offers more than 60 million songs and 250,000 videos.

The service has attempted to use its star power to offer experiences that complement its music. That includes a Rihanna runway show in Paris that was streamed for Tidal members, as well as charity concerts by Jay-Z and Beyoncé.

jgqtd0_SQ,SQ,SQ,"I like Square as a company and see a lot of people are bullish about it. However, a few things stop me from investing. Be interested to hear thoughts but at the moment I am a Square bear. 

**Management**

Jack Dorsey is a visionary. I don’t think this is controversial. However, his track record at Twitter is worrying for shareholders. Be it daily active user growth, ambition with acquisitions but ultimately failure to monetise a fantastic platform where you have big corporations, celebrities and even the President reaching out to 200m daily active users for free. With Square, the closed loop business model of businesses and consumers is again a fantastic concept that could break the power of Visa/Mastercard. Execution remains to be seen, of course. 

**Competition**

Square operate in a highly competitive field for consumers and businesses. Let’s take consumers based on Square’s fast-growing Cash App. It offers things a normal bank does like deposits, ATM access, money transfer. If it becomes a fully-fledged bank offering loans, credit; it is competing against the likes of big incumbents (e.g. JP Morgan, Bank of America). Granted they’re dinosaur firms but they already have a huge customer base that are older and, therefore, have more money and deposits. This means it is much easier for them to monetise their customers resulting in high ARPU. Why would these lucrative customers, en-masse, want to uproot their finances to Square when their existing providers will be providing the same service by copying Square, as JP Morgan have done this week?

For businesses, Square’s provides software offering (invoicing, PoS, online store) but face strong competition from the likes of Shopify who are taking a fully integrated service approach to SMEs which allows them to take their business online but also manage all their backend processes, including payments. This is a highly convenient service for entrepreneurs. Shopify already has 6% share of the online retail market. Square also provides hardware products which make it easy for SMEs, in particular, to take payments. However, there is evidence that retail is facing a more permanent shift in the US vs. the rest of the world with 60% less footfall today than a year ago [Link](https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks/benchmark/daily-footfall). 58% of Square’s GPV is from food/drink, retail and professional services. Square may have good market share but it is a shrinking industry.

And as a final piece, competitors in both spaces are generally in very healthy financial shape: Paypal, Shopify, Global Payments, Western Union and big banks are well-capitalised. 

**Valuation**

Perhaps you can get over the above with the fact that Square has strong network effects and are able to win customers cheaply. However, in my opinion, Square is priced for perfection. Simply looking at a price/sales metric, it is trading 13x LTM. This is high but maybe relatively reasonable for a fast-growing business. However, 25% of Square’s revenue is accounted by Bitcoin “revenue”. This brings little value to Square (2% gross profit) and even Square themselves discount this revenue in their KPIs because it is “out of their control and not reflective of Square’s performance”. 

Now onto profits. It is not fair to be too hard on Square’s profitability. After all, it is in high growth phase and its marketing costs were its highest opex line item at roughly 35% for YTD. However, a cursory look at it is Enterprise Value / EBITDA (forward look to Dec2020), it is 242x. If we give credit for Square’s business plan for a further two years, today’s Enterprise Value over broker consensus forecast EBITDA for 2022, it is still a heady 77x. This is when Square is supposed to have EBITDA of $1bn which is three times more than it is forecast for Dec 2020. Priced to perfection.

If you compare it to Paypal, it is trading at 39x and 27x EV / EBITDA for Dec 2020 and 2022.

**Conclusion**

Square has formidable backers like Ark Invest. I am also not a great believer in “dumb retail” overvaluing a stock for a prolonged period of time. But for reasons above, I am cautious with Square and yet it keeps climbing so please tell me what I am missing…",2020-10-23,22,43

jdj1fd_SQ,SQ,Square $SQ and debit interchange exemption status?,"One of the reasons I've been skeptical of $SQ's rise even post-Covid is that investors seem overly excited by Cash App growth, where the majority of revenue is from \*exempt\* debit interchange fees.

Debit interchange fees were regulated under the Durbin Amendment after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), that put a ceiling on the amount of fees issuers can extract from every debit transaction. The amendment excluded ""small"" issuers with less than $10B in assets, which was mainly targeted toward small regional banks and credit unions. Thus, ""small"" issuers that include Square are paid more than double the interchange fees that a mid to large bank get for the same transactions when you use the Cash debit card to pay for things.

Square has been exempt through the growth of Cash App, but if you look at their last 10-Q they are sitting on $7.8B in assets already, and will likely cross $10B in less than a year from now.

For those with a deeper understanding of payments industry:

1. Does anyone know if the $10B asset threshold is for the company as a whole or just customer deposits on Cash app?
2. Has Square mentioned this exemption status and made any projections on which they would lose that status in any report?

j7eb7i_SQ,SQ,SQ - Square invests 1% of the company's assets into Bitcoin. $50 million dollars,"Ticker SQ

Payments company Square has invested $50 million into Bitcoin, according to an announcement today. It has bought 4,709 Bitcoin, with one percent of the company's assets. 

&#x200B;

> “We believe that Bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,” said Square’s chief financial officer, Amrita Ahuja. “As it grows in adoption, we intend to learn and participate in a disciplined way. For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.” 

Square is owned by Jack Dorsey, **the CEO of Twitter** (and enthusiastic Bitcoin advocate). Square also owns CashApp, which has been offering Bitcoin for some time now. Dorsey has previously said that he regularly maxes out the weekly Bitcoin buy limits on CashApp. 

Square has been investing in crypto for some time. It set up Square Crypto in March 2019 to support the development of the Bitcoin network. It has handed out a number of grants to Bitcoin developers and companies working in the space. 

This investment follows business intelligence firm MicroStrategy buying $200 million of Bitcoin as an investment, before buying another $175 million of Bitcoin.

Right now, the company's main driver is the Cash App which (ironically) is their cashless app that helps customers pay through their phones. With COVID and the strong push for digitization, the demand for Cash App will keep rising. Plus, the company has shown that they are not averse to reinventing and are in good position to take most advantage of the imminent societal transformation. 

Now for some numbers:

* Last quarter, Square's total net revenue was $1.92 billion which is up 64% year-over-year.
* Cash App’s gross profit grew 167% year over year to $281 million.
* Achieved gross profits of $597 million which was up 28% year over year

hmxa7k_PATH,PATH,Mass adoption: blockchain as a norm of modern life,"*It took a whole decade for the economy and business to understand blockchain technology, its strengths, and weaknesses. Several years ago, the first mature options for its practical application began to appear on the market.*

[According to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj9biX1uwg) Joseph Lubin, the founder and CEO of the blockchain company ConsenSys, the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus infection pandemic could be a watershed for blockchain technology.

Joseph Lubin and Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital cryptocurrency bank, discussed the development prospects of the industry and the impact of the pandemic on the cryptocurrency business. Both entrepreneurs believe that the socio-economic crisis is driving industry growth.

## Blockchain for Voting

Participation in online voting makes it possible not to visit polling stations, thereby not only to save time but also to minimize contacts during the pandemic. 

Blockchain e-voting system undoubtedly fights against intruders and excludes the possibility of voting several times, since it stores unchangeable records of all votes and all identification data.

The blockchain e-voting results [are transparent](https://digitalchamber.org/the-future-of-voting-is-blockchain/), cannot be changed, and can be accessed instantly. Blockchain for voting is not only more reliable, but also faster, eliminates the human factor, and allows you to instantly receive election results.

## Blockchain in Logistics

Blockchain technology in logistics will greatly simplify business. Now, to send one typical sea cargo, it is required to have 240 copies of 36 original documents. [Komgo](https://komgo.io/), the consortium of traders, banks, and inspection firms, uses the DLT platform in order to get rid of this paper swamp, optimizing the process of cargo registration on the principle of “Know Your Customer”.

Parties can immediately receive confirmation that they have exact copies of the same data at their disposal, which speeds up the process and avoids legal disputes and conflicts. 

## Tuna Blockchain

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand has [launched](https://www.wwf.org.nz/what_we_do/marine/blockchain_tuna_project/) a pilot project in the Pacific Islands that will use blockchain technology to track tuna paths from “bait to plate”.

The project aims to stop illegal and unregulated fishing, as well as to stop human rights violations in the industry, including corruption schemes, illegal trade, and the use of slave labor in the fishery.

## Blockchain Stamps

Lamborghini decided to digitize its collection postage stamps and [issued](https://www.lamborghini.com/ru-en/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/lamborghini-huracan-evo-rwd-spyder-stamp-size) the first blockchain-based stamp. This technology should guarantee the uniqueness and authenticity of each stamp.

In 2019 Austrian Post Office [launched](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2019/06/12/austrian-post-launches-stamps-on-the-blockchain/) a line of [blockchain](https://cryptonomist.ch/en/categoria/blockchain-en/) authenticated stamps with 5 images of a unicorn. On those stamps, one could find credentials for the authentication on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2020, they kept on with last-year success and [announced](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2020/06/25/crypto-stamps-in-austria/) a new line with animal designs. As every crypto stamp has a private key, being also an Ethereum wallet, one can use them both a real stamp or as an alternative paper wallet with a nice visual style.

## Blockchain Telemedicine

Recently, many medical blockchain projects have been created. One of them is [My Clinic](https://myclinic.com/).

It’s a platform for instant communication with a personal doctor. It is based on a blockchain for exchanging client data, which allows patients to contact a new doctor without the need for a personal visit for an initial examination and transfer of medical documents. Consulting a doctor becomes easier when traveling, taking tests, and undergoing large-scale diagnostics.

## The Future of Technology

Blockchain is likely to transform entire industries and, possibly, the entire economy through integration with other technologies.

The distributed nature of blockchain provides a valuable opportunity to conduct transactions cheaper and faster. Instead of “transferring” copies of documents between lawyers and banks and waiting for each stage of registration to be processed, blockchain gives all parties a complete overview of the procedure for the simultaneous implementation of several stages of the process.

For example, a consortium of law firms has teamed up with blockchain service providers [Proxeus](https://www.proxeus.com/) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ch-de) to reduce the time for setting up a commercial company from a few weeks to a few days. The first company to have made it [Drakkensberg](https://www.drakkensberg.ch/), was generally founded within two hours.

## Resume

Thus, we see that blockchain technology has a wide range of implementations in the near future. And, perhaps, the one who starts it first will be ahead of competitors.",2020-07-07,4,0

Here are my findings from today's activity.

It was a high volume day as markets ripped higher at the open and began the slow fade. On my platform I didn’t come across anything overly unusual per say, but I did see high volume activity happening. I’ll break it down.

**BABA – Alibaba Group Holdings**

Daily sentiment for BABA was very bullish as the stock went on a hugely bullish run. Today we saw a lot of call buying in September expiration, nearly 50k calls traded for that expiration. Players have been accumulating calls the last couple weeks. BABA has seen limited upside in the recent rally due to the suspicions of Chinese stonks getting de-listed. In my opinion BABA still has room to run up even more.

**FB – Facebook Inc**

Today we saw some short-term call buying going into Facebook’s meeting tomorrow that will include Zuck. 6,000 calls were traded at the $235 and $240 strike in two blocks expiring this Friday. Premium paid for those trades was approximately $2.5 million. Worries of Facebook clients withdrawing ad spending has caused the stock to lag behind big tech names in the rally. Momentum looks to be picking back up. Can’t cuck the ZUCK.

**NIO – Nio Inc**

Players looking to ride momentum in NIO after the stock has caught fire. Bullish flow outweighed bearish flow 2:1 in todays options activity.

**SQ – Square Inc**

Today I caught to big plays in SQ that were slightly unusual. Players opened short call position at the $100 and $90 strikes with September expiration. These long dated short calls is a pretty bearish position suggestion that perhaps the stock is over-extended after it’s 100% return over the last 3 months.

**TWLO – Twilio Inc**

Twilio saw some in-the-money call buying today in the January 2021 expiration. Both trades were only approximately 200 contracts in volume, so not very unusual in that sense. Because they were in-the-money the contracts were fairly expensive. The trades were at the $190 and $230 strikes with premiums paid of approximately $1.1 million and $700k, respectively.

**UBER – Uber Technologies**

Today I came across a slew of long-dated out-the-money call buying in UBER. Each block was about 1.5k contracts and bullish sentiment out-weighed bearish sentiment about 4 to 1. This comes off the news of UBER acquiring Postmates. Perhaps players are seeing an opportunity here as UBER begins to monopolize the delivery space. This was the most interesting play of the day today, I’ll be keeping this on my watchlist.

Direction: **Neutral Bullish**

**Price Target:** **50$**

**Type: Short Put**

**Fundamental:** Nothing in Square’s formula has changed since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak. **There is a note that due to the closure of many SMBs, Square’s transaction count will be significantly affected.** Square’s price fell from about 85$ to about 49$ in the span of the first Coronavirus slide, bottoming out at 32$, which was quickly brought up to about the 40$ average. Since then, it has grown alongside the rest of the market. Square will face very little growth for the foreseeable future, but can be a great candidate for covered calls.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD slight shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 40, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and Bearish open interest. Implied movement is a whopping 12.1% or about 5.85$ Short interest is at 7.83%, with 5.2 days to cover. Support at \~41$, with 52w high being 87.25$.

**Sentimental**: Square is a company that will not die. While the valuation was rich, Square was primely in the growth category, with its consistent revenue and EPS increases. The current coronavirus selloff has affected every stock on the market and Square was no exception. In addition, the recent purchase of Honey, alongside essentially halted SMBs, leaves SQ exposed to large risks. Analyst revisions have been entirely negative, as the outlook looks very grim. 

Typically in an elevated IV environment, sell-side earnings play becomes less effective. In addition, because of the current volatile macro environment, the binary event’s sway over price points becomes mitigated as well, making earnings movement even less predictable. **I believe the bottom line here is if SQ moves against you, it can be beneficial long term to absorb the shares and sell covered calls as a way to generate cash-flow**. While this leaves many smaller trades on the sidelines, extraordinary times and risk management dictates safer plays.

Direction: **Neutral**

**Price Target:** **180$**

**Type: Call credit spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** Autodesk is the leader of its industry for 3D product design. While it encompasses many sectors, Automotive and Construction are two of its largest product service segments. Homebuilding experienced a boom late last year, as shown by performances of Zillow, Redfin, HD, Lennar, KBH and more. It’s currently trading off a 210$ high just a few weeks past, skewing its technical data. ADSK has strong free cash flow, which lessens the risk of burnout.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50day moving average, and above 200D moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 45, oversold. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.2% or about 13.34$ Short interest is very low.

**Sentimental**: Autodesk is a product category leader with a consistent track record of growing revenue and improving efficiency. This is a deadly combo, as lack of competition is similar to a product moat. I believe Autodesk has a very strong mid to long term case, but short term positive sentiments can be heavily affected by current macro negatives. Looking at SQ’s performance yesterday, ADSK may beat, but will be negatively affected by the market. ADKS’s guidance will be the make or break factor for this earnings.

**ROI : 15.1%, 30%**

**Risk Level - 4 of 5, Risky, 5 of 5 Manage it.**

The idea is that if ADSK pops, macro will push it down. If it dumps, the bottom might be much lower due to current macro conditions. This one is close, similar to Etsy and SQ. Careful.

Direction: **Neutral Bullish**

**Price Target:** **80$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread** 

**Fundamental:** Square has been growing very quickly and maintains its growth velocity through new product innovation and more market share capturing. SQ also lowballed EPS and Revenue guidance last quarter, making this quarter much easier to beat. However, with the global slowdown due to coronavirus, forward guidance will become very important. Square cannot sandbag guidance this quarter as any weakness shown will be exposed. 

**Technical**: Priced above 50 and 200 day moving averages, below 20D average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 45, neutral. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 8.6% or about 6.64$

**Sentimental**: Square is looking to massively beat EPS and Revenue, and is set up to guide even higher in 2020. The key concern here is the public perception and intense macro fear. **This large negative macro will affect positive earnings negatively, as it prevents a lot of buyers from jumping due to macro fear.** All things aside, square should come out of the earnings on top, but we don’t know how the market will react to a win. 

**ROI : 20%**

**Risk Level - 3 of 5, Risky**

**Close fast if profitable. Square has a very consistent tendency to go lower regardless of earnings the week after.  Sell call credit spreads a week further out if you know how.**

Additionally their revenue streams are now diversified by offering loans to their customers (who are businesses of course) and even debit cards to compete with JP Morgan and the likes.

Supply Chain is an encompassing term for the journey a product makes through manufacturing, shipping, storage, retail, acquisition, further storage and later use. The multiple entities involved in a product’s lifecycle and their actions are sometimes hard to track and account for, leading to uncertainty, additional expenses and even loss, theft or fraud. Supply Chain management products are created to address all of the above and more, helping to ensure authenticity, increase accountability, reduce losses and paperwork, and overall provide much needed transparency that helps build consumer trust and reduce costs for everyone involved.

Blockchain technology is the missing piece to the supply chain management software, providing a tamper-proof single source of truth for tracking the involvement of different companies along the path from manufacturing to consumption. To capitalize on this opportunity, SupplyBlockchain Inc was established in 2018 in the US. It since has a portfolio of customers in the transport, logistics and distribution industries, who substantially reduced their losses by using this innovative system.

The ​strategic alignment ​in this partnership is striking since both companies aim for mass adoption with similar BFT blockchain networks with low latency (sub 5 seconds) and both aspire to introduce interoperability of blockchain ecosystems. Most importantly​, both projects benefit​ from this alliance mutually: Cere plans to introduce Elrond powered services and smart contracts such as ​payment​, ​escrow​, identity services​ as turn-key microservices for Cere’s enterprise customers.

As Elrond’s smart contract framework is acting as an interoperable settlement service with 100% compatibility with Ethereum VM and smart contracts, this can make native asset settlements across Cere, Elrond, and Ethereum networks not only possible but as accessible as a simple software service. Cere is also looking to leverage Elrond’s Adaptive State Sharding technology to accelerate Cere’s planned sharding & scaling implementation to further improve its network throughput.

cfy2x6_PATH,PATH,When Music Streaming Meets Blockchain,"Since Internet went mainstream and the advent of smartphones together with the proliferation of IOT (internet of things) devices, it is evident that existing traditional media such as television and radio no longer have the same kind of mainstream influence as they used to – the focus is shifting. With the help of a growing high-speed internet penetration all over the world, one can easily assert that streaming platforms are raking in the big bucks. In a recent study, According to the We Be Social and Hootsuite 2019 digital report, consumers worldwide spent US$12 billion on digital music streaming in 2018 – this is a whopping eight percent increase from the US$11.2 billion in 2017. This is a testament to the fact that millennials are shifting focus to a convenient access to music. 

Without mentioning that online music streaming is rapidly changing the way music content is being delivered to our device, it is also noteworthy that the days of dishing out $1.15 from your virtual pocket and paying for a single music content is almost now a thing to be remembered in history. This is not just extinct but the phenomenon is almost buried in deep seas. Nowadays, monthly streaming subscription has been adopted with a wide range of free services. Aside the convenience online streaming brings to users, it also serves a huge benefit to artists whose music currently exist on the streaming platforms. CNBC report shows that artists receives $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream roughly. This might look like a negligible amount but when multiplied by the number of streams per year, one could see the green side.  It was reported that Drake had 8.2 Billion streams on Spotify, a non-commercialized streaming platform. A lot more can be done in a better way when combined with a revolutionizing disruptive Blockchain Technology. 

Business are on a daily basis exploring the best way to retain customers and make them stay longer, many are shifting to entertainment. It is certainly cheaper and cost effective to retain 12 customers than the cost required to gain 1.  In an effort to re-modernize the way music is being delivered to users and also help businesses grow, Mozicoore – a revolutionary music streaming platform for business is developing state of the art music streaming platform powered by Blockchain Technology fully licensed for business use. With the use of blockchain technology, Moozicore is introducing a lot more features which are unavailable or completely new to existing non-commercialized platforms like Spotify and Tidal. 

Why Moozicore could be a big deal 

Could this be the birth of another era in the music streaming space? Well, your guess is as good as mine. Moozicore, headed by founder and CEO Adam Krzak is unarguably the first Blockchain based streaming services. You can call it “the streaming blockchain”, being the first players in this space. Moozicore is developing a mobile app with Beacon fully integrated. With this, users can easily control music in venues close to them by voting, adding, sharing and picking songs. It is fully customized to enable a customer to a business gets a push notification prompting them of their favorite songs. By this, they are able to check-in to locations, vote in the apps and share experiences with friends. With this, Businesses will able to retain customers for a longer period of time when their favorites songs are being played in the background. It is also worthy to mention that John McAfee, the famous crypto influencer and enthusiast is an advisor guiding the path of the Moozicore Project. 

The Economics of Moozicore App Usage

The Moozicore token, MZG is the economy on which the Moozicore App runs on. As a way of ensuring a reducing number of the token supply, 10% of all revenue generated via in-app payment will serve as a reference for buying back of MZG tokens from exchange and subsequently burning them as stated by the Moozicore OnePager. This keeps the supply down and subsequently provides better token value for holders. The App could be used in 2 ways as well – the fiat gateway and with MZG token, this to encourage mainstream use as crypto is still in the infancy stage. 

Moozicore Tokensales is almost here.

The Moozicore Token is based on the Ethereum Blockchain, It’s an ERC20 token. 

As a commitment to ensuring the successful launch of the Moozicore Project, Moozicore is issuing 166 000 000 Moozicore token of its total token supply for sales to the public with each token valued at $0.01 which is way cheaper than buying $0.05 in the app after launch. This is an opportunity to get amazing discount just before full launch as tokens will be valued around $0.05 at a regular price in the Moozicore App. Find out more on the Token Sales Page.",2019-07-21,7,8

[Square Quietly Launches Program For CBD Cannabis Company Credit Card Processing |  May 22 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2019/05/22/square-quietly-launches-program-for-cbd-cannabis-company-credit-card-processing/#151930c72329)

Companies that sell cannabis products—even those consisting of CBD derived from hemp, which was legalized in the U.S. through the Farm Bill late last year—are continuing to have trouble accessing basic financial services that are available to businesses in other sectors. That includes being able to maintain bank accounts and process their customers' credit cards. “Square is currently conducting an invite-only beta for some CBD products,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email. When asked about the reasons for the launching the new program, which comes after years of refusing to work with CBD companies, the spokesperson said that the company closely watches evolving public policies and strives to create new opportunities for clients.

[Square Spends $20 to Acquire Each New Cash App User | May 16, 2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-spends-20-acquire-cash-143000656.html)

Square's (NYSE: SQ) Cash App has grown to become a meaningful contributor to the company's top-line growth. The peer-to-peer payments app turned financial multitool is the No. 1 driver of its subscription and services segment, management said at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference. During that conference, CFO Amrita Ahuja noted the company's per-customer acquisition cost for Cash App is about $20. That's actually quite low relative to other financial services, and even compared to other apps.

[Square’s AI Platform Could Transform SQ Stock | May 13, 2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-ai-platform-could-transform-160927487.html)

Eloquent Labs is the developer of Elle, which can converse intelligently with a customer through a conventional online-chat platform without any human input from the service provider. While resolving complex customer-service needs remain currently out of reach, Elle can easily handle simpler-but-distracting tasks like returns and product-tracking.

[Square teams up with Postmates for delivery partnership | May 9, 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/square-teams-up-with-postmates-for-delivery-partnership-2019-05-09?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo)

[Square's Bitcoin Platform Remains Surprisingly Profitable | May 7, 2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-apos-bitcoin-platform-remains-230000557.html)

Square's bitcoin revenue accounted for 6.8% of its net revenue during the first quarter, compared to 5.1% in the prior year quarter. However, Square's bitcoin profits only accounted for about 0.2% of its gross profit during the quarter, versus less than 0.1% a year earlier. Square's bitcoin business won't move the needle anytime soon, but its top and bottom line growth is impressive, especially since bitcoin shed roughly 40% of its value over the past 12 months. If bitcoin's price rises again and it attracts more buyers, Square's bitcoin revenue and gross profits could surge much higher.

Instead of viewing Square's bitcoin platform as a separate business, investors should see it as part of the company's long-term plan to lock users into its Cash App. Cash is one of the top peer-to-peer payment apps in the U.S. alongside PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and the bank-based Zelle, and it's still growing rapidly. Last quarter Square stated that its Cash App payment volume rose nearly 2.5 times annually. For comparison, PayPal stated that Venmo's payment volume rose 73% annually in its most recent quarter.

[How Square's Cash App Makes Money (SQ) | May 6, 2019](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/090916/how-square-cash-works-and-makes-money-sq.asp?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo)

Square makes money from Cash App by charging businesses transaction fees for using its software. For a 1.5% transaction fee, individual users can expedite deposits to have them transferred immediately into their bank accounts instead of waiting the standard deposit time. They can also send personal payments from credit cards for a 3% transaction fee.

[Why Square Is Hiring Cryptocurrency Experts | April 3, 2019](https://marketrealist.com/2019/04/why-square-is-hiring-cryptocurrency-experts/)

Square (SQ) has announced a plan to hire several cryptocurrency experts. Square’s crypto team will work on an open-source initiative as part of the company’s contribution to the development of a cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In the fourth quarter, Square’s Bitcoin business generated $52.4 million in revenue, up from $43 million in the third quarter. Square is already making a small profit from its Bitcoin business even though the overall business is still seeing losses.

[Where Does Square Rank in the Food Ordering Market? | April 3, 2019](https://marketrealist.com/2019/04/where-does-square-rank-in-the-food-ordering-market/)

[Square Partners with Washington Nationals to Enable Order-Ahead and In-Seat Card Payments at D.C.’s Nationals Park | March 27, 2019](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190327005164/en/)

The stand will feature food from exclusive Caviar restaurant partners, featured in a rotating series of pop-ups throughout the season. On Opening Day, fans will be able to enjoy Hong Kong-style Chinese food from Tiger Fork, with future food options including biscuits from Mason Dixie and ramen from Toki Underground. Square Terminal, the handheld, all-in-one payment processing hardware device, will also be piloted by roving concessions hawkers at Nationals Park. Square Terminal will allow fans to pay using credit cards or contactless payments like Apple Pay or Google Pay as they purchase food and beverage items from the comfort of their seats. With Square’s point of sale and employee management software built right into Square Terminal, it’s easy for hawkers to quickly accept payments. Square Terminal will help fans who don’t carry cash, and will speed transaction times as hawkers spend less time counting change and more time making sales.

Some smart investors in here haven't limited their investments towards growers. They've instead opted for the tangential companies that sell nutrients etc. supplies needed to grow the cannabis. This is like selling pickaxes during the gold rush.

(FCAU)-   Strong upward potential over the next few months, in my opinion. New Jeep pickup has just been confirmed, multiple awards won at SEMA, talk of shifting focus from euro market towards the far more profitable US market, I’m curious what others think

My opinions are just to start a dialogue, no one should ever take one comment as fact, like in general, i do feel pretty strongly about FCAU though

Congratulations to the crypto community as MasterCard and Visa raise hands in support of cryptocurrencies and stop seeing them as a threat or law violation. 

""The application from MasterCard outlines a new system that will monitor both crypto and fiat assets, basically acting as a web wallet."" - while this step forward comes with a catch, it is a step forward nonetheless. While MasterCard is on the path of allowing crypto-payments at some point, there is no need to wait when you can use platforms like [GoodX Finance Network​](https://goodx.network/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=subreddit-posting&utm_content=r-CryptoCurrencies) to get a mobile bank with a personal IBAN, and a credit card (a MasterCard actually!) to make crypto payments by converting them at great rates in real-time and actually receiving multiple benefits like cash-backs. ",2018-10-30,1,1

9jjlax_PATH,PATH,My Rationale of Using Blockchain for Marketing,"Hi Redditors! I am working on a blockchain startup ([Nodis.io](https://Nodis.io)) to help small businesses with marketing. I know there is a lot of hype now with blockchain and a ton of projects are using this technology. My team and I are trying our best to really use it for the benefit of the end user. I am just here to share about my rationale for using blockchain in business marketing. Let me know what you think!

\--------------------------------------------------------------

To start, I think there are some strong commonalities between a successful business and a thriving blockchain project:

**Commonality #1 — Solution Focused**

>*Business:* Any successful business needs to be solving some sort of problem for a group of people. It can be as simple as “I want a coffee shop at this corner on my way to work” or it can be “I want to get survey results faster”.  
>  
>*Blockchain:* Time and time again it has shown how institutions have failed us. The lack of transparency and their drive for self-interests at others’ expenses left all of us feeling frustrated or even betrayed. Blockchain aims at solving that problem and eliminates the middleman.

&#x200B;

**Commonality #2 — Trust Earned**

>*Business:* No one would trust a restaurant that constantly causes people to feel ill nor will we trust brands that violate their own value. Earning trust from others is difficult but highly rewarding when obtained. Unfortunately, trust can be lost easily when things go wrong.  
>  
>*Blockchain:* It is the first real alternative that has shown potential in solving the trust issue with centralized institutions like banks or government. Through the use of smart contract within the blockchain, users no longer have to trust another human being to handle their transactions.

&#x200B;

**Commonality #3— Network Growth**

>*Business:* Throwing money at advertisement can only go so far. It is normally the referrals and returning customers that will ultimately make or break the business. A business that has already earned customer trusts can acquire returning business much easier than from a brand new customers.  
>  
>*Blockchain:* A highly involved network of users is key to success. There are contributors and then there are beneficiaries. Sometimes it takes just one person’s influential action to get it going. It wasn’t until someone bought 2 slices of pizza with 10,000 Bitcoins that people realized this “digital money” can actually be used and have value.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Non-Blockchain-Based Marketing Options**There are so many options for businesses to consider. Aside from social media, there are e-marketing, print media, radio, TV, billboards, direct mailing, and all sorts of other ways. And in each categories of marketing methods, there are countless companies trying to compete with each other. While I doubt that blockchain can truly disrupt all the ways of marketing, I believe it does have some unique advantages that businesses can benefit from.

**Our Answers to Use Blockchain to Benefit Business Marketing**

>Blockchain makes cryptocurrency possible and it can be a unique reward system that stands out against thousands of loyalty program out there  
>  
>Blockchain's decentralized mechanism allows us to implement a platform-wide user contribution process that connects them with businesses, which in return can potentially give them lots of exposure

9bwtnx_WFC,WFC,We’re shorting Square Inc (SQ) and this is why you should too,"**Description**

Square (SQ) is a payment processor which caters to small businesses. At $88.00 we think SQ has 65% downside to fair value of $36.00.  The basic premise of the short thesis is:

 

FDC is the industry giant with close to 40% market share, over the past 18 months they have put a ton of resources behind their Clover product which is aimed directly at SQ, it is currently growing 50% and is on pace to be a larger business than SQ by 2020.  Additionally, they have finally gotten their act together with digital customer onboarding (SQ’s primary early competitive edge) and will launch the capabilities through their massive distribution channel starting in the 2H 2018.  Odds are slim that this will not impact SQ competitively and slow their growth rate.

SQ’s core payment processing business growth has in fact already slowed and accelerating top line growth is being driven by more cyclical and risky businesses such as short term working capital loans (Instant Deposit) and lending origination (Square Capital).  

As a point of reference, Square does not control underwriting for their Square Capital product, if banks decided to stop lending to their micro merchants and originations dried up it would take EBIT down by about 35%.

SQ’s customers are by far the most exposed to any kind of economic downturn, close to 60% do less than $125k in volume every year and close to 85% do less than $500k.

Given the above points SQ’s valuation is absurd.  It trades at close to 20x sales and 68x EBITDA.  This is even more disgusting given that of the $245M of EBITDA the street is expecting this year about $215M will be stock comp which everyone is happy to back out (the share count was 360m in 2016 and it will end this year at 480m).

Our fair value target is 30x our 2020 eps estimate of $1.20.  Our estimates assume continued strong growth in both processing and services with steady economic growth, should a recession occur there would be significant downside to our estimates/target.

 **First Data**

 As mentioned above, FDC is the 800lb gorilla in the industry.  We think SQ has been a benefactor of the issues FDC has been having in their bank JV channel for the past 18 months or so stemming mostly from WFC’s branch commission scandal.  The JV channel was always a crown jewel for FDC because anyone who walked into a major bank to apply for a small business loan would have the processing relationship jammed in their face upon closing the deal.  Starting in Q4 of 2017 the leads generated from this channel flattened out after declining by roughly 20% and it feels like the bottom has been reached, as the banks start generating more leads its reasonable to assume some portion would be at SQ’s expense.

SQ’s early competitive edge was digital onboarding.  It takes 10 minutes and can be done without assistance.  Expenses are lower and the customer doesn’t have to deal with greasy salespeople.  Until now FDC had been way behind the curve but starting in the 2H of this year they will roll it out across all channels.  This is particularly important in the JV channel given their bank partners have a combined 6m small business accounts.

At current run rate SQ will do about $80B in GPV for 2018 its growth rate will be around 30%.  Over the same time period FDC’s Clover will do $60B in GPV and growth 50% or so.  Clover is a direct competitor to SQ and industry chatter on the platform is increasingly positive.  We think that if nothing else this shows that SQ does not have a “moat” and the payments processing industry is mature and quite competitive.  SQ’s valuation suggests it’s business model is unique and difficult to replicate, Clover’s success and growth indicates the opposite.

 

**Square Capital and Instant Deposit**

 Another reason SQ gets such a fancy multiple is because investors are excited about the accelerating revenue growth rate driven by the “Subscription and Services-Based” segment.  This accounts for 33% of the total business and grew 98% y/y in Q1.  About 65% of this segment is Square Capital and Instant Deposit and the remaining 35% other odds and ends with the largest chunk being their restaurant delivery service Caviar.  While the growth is both real and impressive we don’t think investors are baking in the cyclical risks of the lending businesses. 

The risks to Square Capital are pretty obvious.  Banks originate the loans and SQ takes 8-15% off the top.  No originations = no revenue and its basically pure profit.  We believe this will be $70m in revs/EBIT this year.

Instant Deposit has been the major growth engine for the past 12 months.  In 2016 it didn’t exist and this year it will likely be a $180M business.  Merchants get charged a 1% for instant settlement of funds versus the standard T+3.  

First of all this is very expensive, PYPL does it for a $0.25 flat fee and larger banks do it for free.  So why does SQ get this?  Our guess would be that nobody else wants to extend credit to these merchants.  

SQ claims the risk is minimal because payments are taken directly out of the merchant’s gross receipts, however, there is nothing to stop them from abandoning their terminal if business gets tough.  The company has always said a lot of their customers didn’t take cards before signing up, so there isn’t a lot stopping them from going back to cash.  This will be about $190m of revs this year with high contribution margins.

 

**Valuation**

 
On a day to day basis SQ seems to want to trade with the FANG complex and it wears a valuation to match that characterization trading at close to 20x sales.  Our issue is that there is nothing recurring about the business model, attrition is close to 20% annually, and their customers will be the first to fold in a downturn.  We think its true comps are FDC/WP/GPN which trade at between 12-19x forward earnings.  SQ deserves a premium due to its growth rate so we think 30x 2020 eps is reasonable.

 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

9bryx0_SQ,SQ,Question about SQ calls due to 9/19,"Hi, 

&#x200B;

i bought 82.5 calls OTM about 10 days ago for 0.12 ea. Now the are at 0.58 due to SQ getting up to 88 yesterday. Now i am not very experienced in Option Trading (getting to know them better and playing a bit) so I would like to ask a question about that call.

&#x200B;

Is it right that SQ only has to hit 90 on 9/19 for the call to be as profitable as it would be to sell it right now? I tried it in 2 optioncalcs and they both said similar things. Main problem is there is no good european option calc and I cant buy US options.

&#x200B;

If this is correct, it would be better to hold through as the Delta is at 0.7335 and the Vega is at 0.0063 atm. So for every Dollar SQ rises i make more and more gains right? If it goes from 120 --> 121 It would be roughly 0.9225 Delta right?

8vi2rg_SQ,SQ,Did Canopy CGC secure a 2.8 million sq ft greenhouse in california?,"I´ll start with my conclusion first: Canopy seems to have a secured a buying option on a 2.8 million sq ft greenhouse in california.

I was digging a little bit and came up with some dots to connect:

In the last Midas Letter Interview Bruce Linton mentioned a „ginormous“ greenhouse in california, and canopy „being in there in instantly“ once the US go legal for recreational.

[https://midasletter.com/2018/06/video-canopy-growth-corp-ceo-bruce-linton-responds-to-viewer-questions/](https://midasletter.com/2018/06/video-canopy-growth-corp-ceo-bruce-linton-responds-to-viewer-questions/)

Bruce Linton: „So think of us as preparing a whole bunch of optionality. You know even we disclosed in the context of the **B.C greenhouse**. They have a greenhouse that’s in **California** that’s pretty ginormous. It’s growing currently I guess some fairly happy tomatoes. But, if and when it was federally legal that would be something we have now **established a cap on purchase price and** **being able to be in there instantly**. 

Next dot: Canopy has a 66&#37; stake in the BC Tweed joint venture and agreed in May to buy the remaining stake. The President of BC Tweed, Victor Krahn, apparently owns this 64 acres greenhouse in California (yes, that´s 2.8 million sq ft.).

The legacy business has been a drag but last quarter the company reported its first growth for 23 quarters.  That looks set to continue as new business or “strategic imperatives” now account for about 46% and are growing fast. 

Strategic imperatives refers to the company’s investments in cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security technologies. The growth in this segment is primarily from the security business revenues, which skyrocketed 49%, cloud business revenues, which grew 20%, analytics, which grew 9%, and mobile business revenues, which grew 7%.

While other companies are soaring just because they change their name to include blockchain IBM trails the market even though it is a blockchain leader that has worked with 400 clients on blockchain projects.

I dont think thats going to last forever.

7vtmry_IBM,IBM,The right time to by this blockchain stock (TSX.V LTV),"TL;DR version:

LeoNovus is a provider of solutions to cloud data storage using blockchain technology. It was included as a major underlying component in a recently launched blockchain ETF. Blockchain stocks are all the hype, but LTV actually has solid fundamentals. It currently has projects with government of Canada, large Canadian bank, and a Canadian college. It is currently on a hot hiring spree for more software engineers as it vamps up its platform and take up more projects (just google LeoNovus careers). For more info on their recent accomplishments, check out the list on the bottom! If you want to invest in blockchain companies without trading cryptos, LTV is one of your best bets! 

Long version:

A year ago today, bitcoin was at $1025USD, ethereum was at $11.3USD, NEO was not even a thing… Even with the current crypto market sell off, if you have bought bitcoin and ethereum a year ago, you are still up 580% and 5800% on your investments, respectively. However, don’t beat yourself too hard if you have missed the crypto rally. There are still other opportunities, namely the rise of the blockchain technology.

You may wonder isn’t betting on cryptocurrencies the same as betting on blockchain technologies. Not really. Why?

1)   **Not every blockchain needs a native currency.** There are two types of blockchain – public and private. The difference between public and private blockchains is similar to the differences between Internet and intranet. The Internet is an open public space that anyone can tap into, while an intranet is designed to be a private space. Both bitcoin and ethereum are public blockchains. All transactions on a blockchain must be validated and embedded in data blocks, which essentially form the blockchain. Since the creators of public blockchains likely do not have the processing capabilities to handle all the transactions alone, miners step in. Miners on public blockchains need a reward for verifying transactions, therefore, cryptocurrencies are necessary for the operations of public blockchains. On the other hand, private blockchains are internal networks that are tightly controlled and do not require the need for a robust network of miners to verify transactions/blocks. Private blockchains are primarily used for business application where access to the chain is limited to certain parties. Cryptocurrencies are not a necessary component for most private blockchains.

2)   **Regulators are keeping their eyes close to cryptocurrencies and are trying to regulate them. However, they have shown very supportive attitude towards the development of blockchain technologies.** At this point, the consensus view is that: at some point down the road, blockchain will revolutionize part of, if not the whole, society. Regulators may frown upon cryptocurrencies given their speculative nature, but they have also come to realize that they cannot afford not to embrace blockchain technologies. In December 2017, Janet Yellen called bitcoin as a “highly speculative asset”. As to a government-issued digital currencies, she commented ”While we’re looking at research on this topic, there are, I think to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a limited need for it and some substantial concerns.” Blockchain technologies have definitely started being adopted across multiple departments in the US government. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, The Department of Defense Transportation Command, The Food & Drug Administration all have issued notices saying they would looking into potential application of blockchain technologies.

Why should you invest in blockchain technology stocks?

1)  **Blockchain technology is not a fad.** Many of the applications have passed the proof-of-concept stage, and started being adopted for social and business uses.

2)  **It is investing in the next “big thing”.** Talking about blockchain today is like talking about the Internet back in the 90s – it is just difficult for people to imagine its specific applications. But most of us can see it being broadly applied.

3)  **Unlike cryptocurrencies which are highly speculative, the development of blockchain technology has its fundamentals.** So far, it has been hard if not impossible to time all the cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, investing in blockchain stocks comes down to understanding applications of the technology and evaluating businesses, which can be much more predictable. 

4) You may say, well, a lot of this blockchain stocks sell off when the cryptocurrency market melts. True. But investors panicking over their blockchain stock holdings when the cryptocurrencies are down just indicates how naïve those investors are – they look at blockchain stocks as another way to profit on cryptocurrencies, which is totally wrong. **And if anything, it means opportunities for better educated investors.**

5)  **Opportunities are yet to come.** The realm of public blockchains and their native assets is most relevant to the innovative investor at this stage. Private blockchains have not yield an entirely new asset class that is investable to the public. However, with the rise of blockchain technology, I believe this will come, and it will create new investment opportunities.


That being said, don’t just throw your money into any start-up companies that have the word ""blockchain"" in their names. There are a ton of garbage stocks out there doing nothing in blockchain and just waiting to monetize on stockholders’ hard-earned money. 

Investing in blockchain technology stocks is no easy task, it requires a lot of due diligence. One of the most basic questions investors need to ask is: Does the blockchain technology project make sense? This applies to both public and private blockchains. For example, STEEM is a public blockchain many investors are familiar with (Currently, it is among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap.) STEEM aims to offer a blockchain-based social media platform, where users can earn rewards through activities such as posting. But, think for a second. Do we need a decentralized Facebook? If not, well, this is exactly what STEEM does. This spells out the biggest challenge many investors face. **We all agree that blockchain will become a big thing, but not every company needs to get on a blockchain and not every company will benefit from a decentralized system.** Unless the management actually understands blockchain technology and how their company in particular will benefit from it, many of their new initiative on blockchain could just be noise. And it is investors' job to filter through it.

Moreover, don’t expect a 200% return on your blockchain technology stocks in a year if you invest in the companies like Intel, Amazon or Walmart. I get it, all of the giants have said they are engaging in blockchain, and I believe they have the ability to come up with interesting things. But how much of they company earnings will be driven by the blockchain initiatives? And what’s the fraction of that will be translated into their stock prices? Tiny, probably.

So, after all this talk, here is one stock I like a lot - LeoNovus (TSX.V: LTV). I have been following the stock for four months now. The company has undergone rapid growth in the one year time since it launched its first product. The company is offering specific solutions to cloud data storage using blockchain technology - this project has broad applications; and cloud data storage can be truly made more secure yet accessible with blockchain technology. On the technical front, LTV is partnering with DTL Labs, the company behind Enterprise Ethereum, IBM’s Fabric, R3’s Corda, and JP Morgan’s Quorum. On the application front, LTV has signed contracts with the Government of Canada, one of the Canadian leading banks, a leading Canadian college, and a global healthcare data provider to install their platform. As a start-up company that only started selling its products less than a year ago, these are significant achievements. The stock has been recently sold off a lot with the broader crypto sell off, even on the backdrop of great new developments. To me this is a buying opportunity. 


For more details on the company, keep reading...

Leonovus is a blockchain-hardened software-defined cloud storage solutions provider for enterprise. Their patented algorithms virtualize, transform, slice and disperse data across a network of on-premises, hybrid or multi-cloud storage nodes, which allows for secure object-based data storage that across the entire solution. The architecture is designed to minimize latency, optimize availability, reduce remote backup costs and meet data sovereignty requirements.

They have strong management team! I dug in on their employees profile and found most of them have strong IT architecture and software background, this is especially true for those who at the top of the company structure. So many of the start-up blockchain companies are ran by people in the financial industry. Well, no offense, as I am also one of the capital market employees, but really, how much do we actually know about the technicals to develop a great blockchain project. Very little I would say.

Leonovus launched its first product at the beginning of 2017. Within one year, the company has undergone rapid growth in product development, sales, as well as partnership. Here is a timeline of major events:
January 10, 2017 - Leonovus launched its software-defined object storage solution solving security and compliance requirements for enterprise cloud storage. The solution is designed to bring enterprise cloud users an increased level of data security, recoverability and compliance across any combination of cloud storage solutions. The solution is hardware and software agnostic, which cuts implementation costs for enterprise. As an Oracle Gold Cloud Partner, Leonovus complements Oracle’s storage solution offerings by bringing GRC (governance, risk management and compliance) to Oracle’s IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud storage solutions and providing a foundation for enhanced GRC in all of Oracle’s cloud PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions.

January 30, 2017 - The software-defined object storage solution is in trials by one of the largest public colleges in North America to ensure its sensitive data meets compliance standards and remains secure within the cloud. Leonovus will begin with the institution’s multi-cloud environment in late February 2017, with the potential of being implemented into the other 24 post-secondary schools within its peer network over the next 24 months.

June 21, 2017 - The new product, Leonovus 365, targets the installed base of 89 million Microsoft 365 users. It provides Microsoft 365 with advanced security and compliance features, and it can pool the cloud storage from all the OneDrive licenses into one managed cloud storage instance. Users are able to achieve advanced collaboration in Leonovus 365.

September 26, 2017 - Leonovus announced enhancements to its existing data storage solution via the integration of blockchain technology. The company’s core technologies offer scalable distributed data storage with improved security, governance, and compliance while reducing costs, risk and providing additional defense against cybersecurity threats. The utilization of blockchain technology further enhances its effectiveness. The company’s previous adoption of blockchain technologies:


1st - In 2014, the company produced and deployed a managed, loosely-coupled blockchain computation pool built from available idle resources. The system managed both public and private blockchain computation on thousands of low/no-cost computing cores across North America with only a few clicks of a mouse from a browser-based dashboard.

2nd - In 2014, the company leveraged its proprietary distributed computing technology to mine digital currency from low-end distributed devices.

October 4, 2017 - Leonovus partnered with DLT Labs to accelerate the engineering of the blockchain components of the storage solution. DLT Labs is a global leader in implementing permissioned and non-permissioned blockchain solutions for enterprises. The Lab has extensive enterprise experience and expertise with all distributed ledger/blockchain technologies including Enterprise Ethereum, IBM’s Fabric, R3’s Corda, JP Morgan’s Quorum, and etc.. During one interview with DLT Labs, they expressed firm belief that Leonovus would continue market leadership in the field.

October 23, 2017 - Leonovus signed a proof of concept agreement with one of Canada’s “big six” banks (For those who live in the U.S., Canadian banking sector is entirely dominated by the six biggest banks, and there are not regional banks.) Leonovus will install its blockchain-hardened software to assist the bank in developing a multi-site data storage management fabric with data security, performance and compliance metrics that meet the bank’s data governance policies. Leonovus will also help the bank to leverage and maximize its current storage assets to form a secure and compliant private cloud storage network that will dramatically reduce data storage costs while increasing data security.

November 3, 2017 - Leonovus signed a proof of concept agreement with a global health data services company. This project will help deliver an improved user experience to the 20,000 Citrix users. This project came from the challenge that data may reside in different geographical business zones. As such a business user who lives in the North American Zone may have to log in and pull a file back from the European Zone. Due to inter-continental latencies, pulling in data from another geographic zone provides the end user with a poor experience, causing frustration and potential delays. Leonovus blockchain-hardened can be the solution to this problem.

January 24, 2017 - After four months of technical and market evaluation by the Government of Canada (GOC), Leonovus is pre-qualified to receive up to $500,000 purchase order from the GOC. The next step is to choose the sponsoring GOC department. There is potential for three additional $500,000 purchase orders in 2018, paid from departmental budgets.

Other than the above-mentioned breakthroughs, Leonovus has committed to many new partnerships with established companies in IT infrastructure services, cyber security, and data providers, to further access the total market for the technology. These companies include: ZoneTI (Canada-based), Snowy River International (Canada-based), Storage Made Easy (UK-based), FlexTy Solutions Inc. (Canada-based), ApexIT (US-based).

Back in June 2017, Leonovus has started to follow Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), which is a joint American and Canadian security accreditation program for cryptographic modules. The program is for vendors who seek to have their products certified for use by the U.S./Canadian Government and regulated industries that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate ""sensitive, but not classified"" information. The certification process is expected to be completed in eight to twelve months. This will help broaden the use of Leonovus’ products.



Last but probably the best point to buy LTV today is... 

A momentum trade is also likely to push LTV stock higher tomorrow. The very first Canadian blockchain technology ETF (TSX: HBLK) is about to start trading on Feb 7th, 2018. LTV has a significant weight in the ETF portfolio. Given the high demand in blockchain ETFs, I expect the ETF will start trading with high buying volume. For each unit of the ETF sold, the ETF provider needs to go buy the corresponding number of underlying stocks to back it up. For emerging companies such as LTV, if the ETF has high trading volume, it will definitely drive up the demand for the stocks.
Just to give you a rough measure. When the first marijuana ETF (TSX: HMMJ) hit the Canadian market back in April 2017, we witness some smaller names in the portfolio getting pushed up 20% in the week following the launch. And HMMJ marked the top net inflow ETF in Canada in 2017.",2018-02-07,0,2

At this point I'm holding those shares for no real reason as I think it is past maturity and very likely to see a big correction at any negative news. Don't get me wrong, I love the company, but isn't anyone getting a bit scared how fast this stock keeps growing for no real reason ? I've done a lot of research along with comparisons to other stocks and SQ is one of those stocks that simply don't justify its current price. What astounds me even more is that many people are jumping on it right now while it's up more than 200% year to date. Please share your reasons for being Bullish or Bearish on this stock, I'd really appreciate that. Thank you and happy Thanksgiving !",2017-11-23,19,19

7et6zz_SQ,SQ,Thoughts on SQ,"Hey y'all! I know Square has gotten a lot of attention lately, and people are either worried it'll burst or worried they're too late to buy in or this or that. I figured I'd give my two cents and start a bit of a discussion about because I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts! 
Just to clarify, I have so far only ever considered myself a speculator of markets. I've been trading for a little under a year. In that time I've been researching a lot about stocks and the way they work and reading books in my free time. I consider finance my passion and am trying to always learn new stuff. This is my very first post Reddit, besides comments, so bare with me if i seem newbish. 
Anyways, I first noticed SQ when it was trading at about $17.90. I work as a bank teller and had noticed that although the bank offers merchant services (the SQ equivalent) it was not popular. We had great deal to incentivize customers to switch, but they never did. All of my customers I would sell to told me they used SQ instead. 
I used my knowledge from the book one up on Wall Street to make the decision of buying into SQ and have not been disappointed. However, I do believe it is time to sell. Here is why. 
I won't lay out that it's an over priced stock, many people have made this argument and I myself have not looked at the numbers to justify making that argument. I will say however, that I have always considered myself an observer of cryptocurrencies, I promised myself that I would not touch the stuff. Given that SQ is now seeking to change up its app to allow customers to use it, that has potentially driven the price further up. If Bitcoin is a bubble, which I believe it is for certain reasons, then when it burst, if it ever does, I believe SQ will soon follow. Although when I first invested in SQ I believed it to be a sound investment, I do not want to gamble on cryptocurrencies, I would much rather observe, even if it that means missing out on potential gains. I would not advise anyone to do anything with their money, it is yours to do with as you please. I just want to hear y'alls thoughts on SQ and have an open discussion about it. Thank you for reading. 

Tl;dr: SQ is bubbling and given certain trends I believe it is time to sell. This isn't a warning to everyone else to sell, simply for personal reasons I believe it is time to get rid of it. I am curious to hear what everyone and anyone has to say about SQ. ",2017-11-22,3,19

7djzkb_SQ,SQ,SQ - A model analysis summary,"Square is a very hot company right now, within my favorite sector, FinTech. However, it has had an extreme year, and so, many people are considering jumping the wagon. I got in ""late"" @32.6, after my interest got peaked and I built a model using Discounted net present value evaluation. If anyone is interested, I could provide the entire model, however, here are the highlights. 

Square handles payment systems for small business, providing tons of service for low fees, that are easy to implement for businesses. They are building an ecosystem, where a company elects to use their business and gets everything they need on the fintech side of every business. 

**Revenue & Prospects** The average year to year revenue gain for the last quarters has been 28%, which has been very steady as the company figures out its new position in the market. Its advances within loans and general banking expands their market share of the fintech market into loans, banking and even business assistance as they can provide EVERYTHING a small business might need.

The Square application is within the top at both IOS (iphone) and Google play (android). It´s by far the most accessable service among competitors, giving great growth, which is shown in the numbers.

**Model numbers**
Transaction revenue is up on average 30% year to year each quarter in 2017, while their subscription revenue y/Y is up around 70% consistently each quarter. Their hardware is struggling, however it is a fraction of the transactions which is the largest by far.

In Q1 2016, Hardware revenue was over twice as large as subscription, however today the subscription is twice as large as the hardware. This show incredible growth of average 70% in the area where they make the most money.

Transaction margins is around 31% consistently, while hardware is usually at a 40% loss. However, their BY FAR fastest growing cashflow stream of subscriptions hold an incredibly strong margin of 70%. Surreal growth in high margin business is one of the most attractive things for a business to have.

**Prediction (discounted cashflow analysis)**
If we assume that the current y/y revenue growth to be maintained throughout 2018, to then drop off from 30% to 20% in 2019 and maintain that to 2022 (which is in my opinion very conservative), to then drop off 14% growth in revenue (lower than many tech companies today) all the way to 2031, we get a conservative perhaps but realistic revenue prediction.

We assume that cost of goods sold are maintained, their margined neither improved or worsened, as this is hard to predict. It comes down to management, which for the record I belive will do greatly. 

We assume that r&d and overall operating expense increases along with revenue, along with a taxation of 25% once full  steady profitability is achived, along with a long term maturity of -2% over a long time, and a discount rate at 7%.

The discount rate is decided based on the risk of failure, and 7% is quite high. The company is relatively small, and the risk follows.

**Finale:**
This all gives a final net present value of 19 259 036 000, after the net present value have cash and debt added into it. This puts the value of the stock to 50,16 USD, which gives 28% upside to its current price of 40.

I am bullish, and while the gain of 28% is not risk free, this shows that the stock is not yet over valued, as the cashflow and balance sheet supports the inflated price. At this point it's probably not a scream purchase, but the management is fantastic, and the company is worth more than its valued at currently.

My portfolio was 6% SQ previously, and after this evaluation it is increased to 20% of the portfolio. I am aware of the risk, and I warn of that risk. However, SQ wont suddently drop, as the finances support the price. IT MIGHT correct, which is impossible to predict, as the price has increased fast.

Note. My personal evaluation is that growth derivative will still increase, and it will grow faster than my projection. My personal evaluation is 50.16 conservativly, but my price target is at 50. However I will hold long term after that, after selling off some for profit. 

Note: Forgot the notion of america vs international business. Currently, the US is roughly 96% of their revenue, while internationally is the other 4%. HOWEVER, the international portion doubles currently year-to-year, showing huge potential internationally, which is how I get my higher price target


Edit:
As predicted, the stock has corrected and recovered. I sold half my position, and now hold half position ad nauseum as squares market increase internationally and transaction wise ",2017-11-17,80,23

I personally feel very strongly about FB's future success and ways to take a willing consumer base give them info and monetize whatever they want to venture into. I bought 20 shares at $118 but sold off half of them when it was at $135.

I got into $SQ and $SHOP (wife is small business owner) and struggle deciding which to really pump into. I like potential of both and their current financials don't scare me because I believe they are spending money the right way and can reap big profits in the near future.

My issue is $SQ is at $27ish and $SHOP around $92. I'm looking for the most growth opportunity and while I like SHOP's overall business model the most and their dominance among the sector, I think SQ has the better chance to triple their stock price than SHOP currently. Mainly because I think a small business would adapt SQ services before SHOP services and SQ is more appealing to even the smallest business owner.

What they mean is, SQ is a payments company, specifically point-of-sale terminals, etc. Their software, and hardware let business take card payments. But you probably know that, as you'll have seen their brand, which incidentally isn't a proper square, in a coffee shop near you!

Though, as with all payment businesses, it's more complicated than that, as Square's clients need invoicing tools, the ability to take payments online, and manage charge backs and fraud. Square helps on all fronts. And recently, they've even launch a consumer business: Square Cash, letting people send money to each other. 

Plus they bought an online food delivery app called Caviar. What? Why are they any better than UberEats, Deliveroo, or GrubHub?

## Are they unique?

They'd like to think so, but there are clearly lots of alternatives. This doesn't feel like a winner takes all market! Here's how they describe their competition:

> (We) focus on building products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable. 
  
> For payments and point-of-sale services, we compete primarily with traditional acquiring processors and payment processors who sell costly card terminal and point-of-sale systems, often tied to long-term contracts, through direct sales or Independent Sales Organization (ISO) channels. Many competitors offer payments and point-of-sale services that have features tailored to particular industries or business types but require sellers to stitch together technology from multiple hardware, software, and payments vendors.

## Recent financials 

From a financials perspective, the top line's growing, but where's the cashflow!

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $0.2bn | $0.6bn | $0.9bn | $1.3bn | $1.7bn|
|EPS | -$0.71 | -$0.82 | -$1.08 | -$1.24 | -$0.50|

Though it isn't really as bad as that, or so they say, with an adjusted EPS of +$0.04 a share last year. They get to an adjusted profit by ignoring the $48m patent settlement that had to pay and ignoring the stock option expenses.

Oh, and yes, they have cash on the books, so the balance sheet looks fine, but don't expect any dividends or buyback soon. Quite the contrary, expect dilution from all them options.

# 2. How do they compare?

There's no good peer for Square, or at least no exciting one. It's competing with Verifone and other POS companies like Ingenico. But their margins aren't exciting.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Square Inc | $1,791M | 0% | -17%
Equipment & solutions | | |
VeriFone Systems Inc | $1,880M | 10% | -17%
Ingenico Group SA | €2,312M | 20% | 15%
Shopify Inc (US) | $444M | -6% | -13%
Fiserv Inc | $5,568M | 35% | 35%
Global Payments Inc | $3,870M | 21% | 12%
Cards & transactions | | |
Visa Inc | $16,829M | 68% | 17%
Mastercard Inc | $11,064M | 57% | 75%
American Express Company | $32,517M | 25% | 24%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $11,273M | 21% | 10%

And when it comes to valuation it's worth more than Verifone and Ingenico put together. 

With no cashflows of note or dividend, we'd have to dream up a rosy future... or rely on price to sales. So at 5x sales it's a fraction of Visa and Mastercard, but inline with Paypal.

I don't get it! Though I clearly didn't get [Shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/6bhvm5/time_to_shopify_shop/) either.

# 3. Wall Street thinks?

And I don't get Wall Street! They say _Buy_ but the consensus target price is $21, 10% off the current price.

# And the Point is?

Sure the market's a fan, recently. 1Q results at the start of May, and an investor day at the end of May, has seen the stock ramp from high teens to mid twenties. But sales forecasts ain't up, and Square's expected to lose money in 2017 and 2018.

I don't mind losses for high growth businesses, but Square isn't accelerating it's sales. It'll add $400m this year and next, but that's all it grew last and the year before. This is no Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, or even an early stage Twitter. 

Payment systems, in particular transactions, is hard. And it exists already, with a lot of legacy installled at businesses and in consumers. 

But for me, the final nail in the coffin, was the investor day... they felt the need to have an **Investment Thesis** section. Call me old fashioned, but aren't companies supposed to explain their businesses, not opine on their share price!

Sorry, I ain't comin' round. They're square as far as I care.

New Age Farm Inc (C:NF) 
 Shares Issued 105,573,317
 Last Close 2/21/2017 $0.235
 Tuesday February 21 2017 - News Release

Mr. Carman Parente reports

NEW AGE FARM TO DOUBLE GREENHOUSE CAPACITY AT ITS WASHINGTON STATE CANNABIS FACILITIES; INCREASED CAPACITY CAN LEAD TO TENANT-GROWER REVENUES OF UP TO $32 MILLION PER YEAR

New Age Farm Inc. has acquired a further 24,000-square-foot greenhouse structure to augment the previously announced addition of a 21,000-square-foot greenhouse (see news release dated Nov. 29, 2016). By adding these two structures, totalling 45,000 square feet, to the existing 5,600 square foot state of the art facility completed in 2016Q4, New Age Farm's Tier 2 and Tier 3 tenant-growers will be able to grow at full, 100% allowable I-502 capacity, year-round. The entire 45,000 square feet of greenhouse structure combines Cravo, Nexus and Hired Hand Green components for state of the art capabilities and 14 foot high trusses provide an ideal environment for growing large plants.

Revenue Potential

By operating at full capacity, our current tenant-growers will have potential for gross annual revenue from their crops of up to $32 million. New Age Farm's potential revenues come from invoicing its tenant- growers. An increase in crop revenue means a direct increase in invoiced revenue for New Age Farm. Year-round growing of crops maximizes the revenue potential for New Age Farm and its tenant-growers.

The Company's CEO, Carman Parente expanded: ""When at full capacity and at maximum yield, our current Tenant Growers can generate approximately $32 million per year in gross revenues including flower sales, extracted oils, lotions, food additives, etc. Our Master Growers are on site to assist our tenant-growers achieve the best possible crop yields as well as using their distribution channels to assist in their product sales. We are looking forward to seeing our tenant-growers operating year-round at full capacity in 2017.""

We seek Safe Harbor.

4zdcuj_SQ,SQ,My case For $SQ,"Hey fellow Robinhoodies,

Yall might've seen me talking about $SQ in some of our threads and stuff so I thought I might give you guys all the research I've done. I'm not an expert by any means so take all of this as you will but I do have a background in Web Design, App Development, and User Experience/ User Interface Design.

My background and career are the biggest influences in my backing of Square, I starting using Robinhood specifically so that I could invest in Square shortly after they went public.

Square was co-created by the same guy that made Twitter. They make and distribute credit card readers that enable small businesses to have credit card capabilities. There is a lot that goes into this side of their operation, you can read more about it here https://squareup.com/

They also help facilitate small business loans. [This Fool article](http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/23/a-deep-dive-into-square-inc.aspx?source=yahoo-2&utm_campaign=article&utm_medium=feed&utm_source=yahoo-2&yptr=yahoo) helps explain ""Now, Square doesn't fund these loans, that's important thing. They're basically a facilitator. They take all this data, they analyze it, look at it scientifically, and see who is prospective for the loan. And then they pair those with investors. And what this has resulted in is a really good averaged default rate of 4%.""

The other side of their operations created and runs the Cash App. Square cash is an app similar to Venmo. Basically it enables anyone with a smartphone to send money to anyone else with the app. Peer-to-peer money transferring, for free(to an extent), instantly. 
https://cash.me/

The instantly part is really where Squarecash shines. I've used pretty much every popular P2P money transfer (Venmo, Paypal, Google Wallet) and I can say hands down Square Cash is the easiest and fastest to use. Its much more streamlined and has the best user experience than any of it's competitors. 

$SQ is now reaching close to its record high. This is because of a very positive earnings report. [Summary here] (http://social.outfoxthestreet.com/blog/43035848437?utm_source=maxsocial&utm_content=post) And here is the [latest shareholders letter](http://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2016/q2/Square-2016-Q2-Shareholder-Letter.pdf)

Earlier this year they also [closed a deal with apple](http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/square-cash-apple/) to facilitate P2P transfers through iMessage, which is huge. Using their service, any iphone user will be able to send money to each other just through txt messages. 

For all these reasons listed above I think that $SQ is putting themselves in a perfect position to become the standard of P2P money transfers in the US. They are [expanding to foreign markets](http://www.businessinsider.com/square-looks-to-be-ramping-up-in-europe-2016-8) as well so their growth could be exponential.

I think that $SQ is a solid investment and wouldn't be surprised if they doubled in a few years. 

Here are a few more recent articles about the company if yall wanna hear some more in-depth analysis:
