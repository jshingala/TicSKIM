14rab7s_SWKS,SWKS,Skyworks Sokutions - SWKS,"I'd be interesting in everyone's opinions of SWKS.
Having looked into them I can see they have strong fundamentals, low levels of debt and fantastic ROIC.

There is some concern around their reliance on Apple but these seems to be being addressed by diversifying their portfolio (see their recent acquisition of Silicon Labs and RF360). They also rely on manufacturing in China  however this is also being addressed with new manufacturing facilities in the US and other countries.

From a price point I think they may be close to the value range, which i have a buy price target of $110 (which is also reinforced by Seth Klarman's recent purchase in Apr-23 at a price point of approx. $117).

So, what are your thoughts? Am I missing something here?",2023-07-05,9,9

Not that the required rate of return is higher than the normal 10%, so there will be volatility for this one.

dsg6xz_SWKS,SWKS,Skyworks (SWKS) releases earnings Nov 12,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-skyworks-solutions-swks-153203799.html

They are expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports result. But as the article suggests that may change depending on the actual results. The stock may go higher if actual beats estimate. Earnings to be released November 12.

The stock has been on a gradual incline the past few days. They produce semiconductors for various cell phone companies, among other devices and electronics. They will produce semiconductors for 5g applications as well.

I'm thinking the predicted decline in earnings is due to the current decline of 4g needs. The stock should increase when 5g becomes more mainstream.

cm7dzy_SWKS,SWKS,Anybody buying puts on Skyworks $SWKS,"UBS rates this company as the most exposed company to China at nearly 80%. 12% of their sales came from Huawei which they had to drop because of the US security concerns. Nearly half of their revenue comes from supplying apple for their mobile phones. The only reason I’m doubting this move is because they already lowered guidance last quarter and that apple mobile phone sales were better in China (-12% compared to -17%). They also blew out Apple Watch sales but that’s a smaller portion of SWKS revenue closer to 23%

The stock was already down 8% last week due to the trade war news. 

When they slashed guidance last quarter the stock dropped from the low 90s to the high 60s

459oqu_SWKS,SWKS,$SWKS looking crazy cheap,"I'm finally caving and getting bullish on a few stocks.  Skyworks is one of them.

I think the recent decline is an overreaction to slowing iPhone growth.  Skyworks has been reducing their dependence on Apple for the last few years.  Nobody outside of Skyworks knows the actual numbers, but I've seen it estimated that Apple accounts for anywhere from 10% to 30% of revenue.  Definitely nothing dire.  They are pursuing business in the IoT space, and they already have contracts with Cisco, Ericsson, GE, and a bunch of other big players.

Fundamentals look solid:

* TTM P/E of 11.6
* **0 DEBT**, 1 bil in cash
* Projected 5-year growth rate of 22%

Does anyone put much faith into charts? I know the market can be irrational sometimes but a huge drop for a company that routinely beats earnings estimates and raises its dividend seems a bit excessive.

36eas3_SWKS,SWKS,SWKS - Skyworks,"Any opinions on Skyworks Solutions?  They have been on a fabulous tear.  I got in at a share price of $59 (Current price hovering around $103 today)...Bought a January 2016 $30 call for $28/share back in September...Sitting on a 319% annualized gain at the moment.  Closing out my position because ""sell in May and go away"".  

Let me elaborate a bit...The interest rate situation, combined with the typical market weakness in the coming quarter scares me a little.  My options expire in January, and with SWKS breaking new 52-week highs and a trailing PE of around 30, I don't see that I could gain much more by riding this option play out until expiration, but I do stand to lose a lot in a market pullback (whether its a crash or not, doesn't matter).

As a company, I think they are doing very well...If this were a long term stock play, I'd probably hold.  What do you guys think?  Selling now is the right move, or hold to expiration?
