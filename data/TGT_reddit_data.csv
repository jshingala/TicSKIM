1ku1fjg_GOOGL,GOOGL,Blackberry acquisition target,"Blackberry has re-invented its self many years ago and is no longer a phone company. This is for the better and it is now a mobile technology security company of some merit. BB is into any remote tech that could be hacked such as cars or any network linked device. Blackberry are gaining traction with full stack approach. 

2.24b market cap provides a target to a great number of companies that would value from this technology. 

This is a growing market that will tie to the AI/robotics future and the pay to borrow not own future. 

I personally think it is one of the more interesting companies in the tech space currently. 

I see also progression of tech M&A after a bit of a recent slowdown. 

List of companies that could acquire 
Plantir

Daft - IONQ or any other greatly appreciated looking for targets to justify price/survive ",2025-05-24,21,22

1krcxvp_TGT,TGT,"Target, Temporary Dip or Dead in the Water?"," As we progress through another slow week of earnings reports, one noteworthy one comes from Target (TGT) Wednesday before the markets open. Target has struggled recently, as their foot traffic has been on a steady decline for the last 10 weeks, and they are being wrecked by their competitors, Walmart, Amazon and Costco. Additionally, their customer spending is falling.

Despite the above, there are still some bulls when it comes to TGT. Most notably, BofA still has a strong buy rating on it, with a price target of $145 per share. Additionally, Joseph Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group changed his price target from $145 to $130, however they reiterated their buy rating.

Using our AI program to isolate the best risk/reward trades, we found the best trades for both sides. All we do is input the strikes we want(125,75) and the expiration(0815) and it finds the best trades.

https://preview.redd.it/h3tkajzlgz1f1.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f43c2a35e68ae7f9a83107c71847e823961922a

First, for you bulls out there, we found a 115/120 Call Spread, expiring in August.

https://preview.redd.it/6rzkhfcogz1f1.png?width=3035&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf55bbfa82f08ee3f63d2b59c2240b7468f149f

The cost of this trade is slightly above average, but still cheap and well within our ideal range, showing strong value.

https://preview.redd.it/qb1ibzupgz1f1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c77cf3883c19647916615b492c3221773467529

Historically, the price of target is down. It down massively from its summer 2021 highs, and is currently still reeling from the tariff news. It has tried to move positively, but is struggling to do so. That being said, with the volatility in the markets currently, it’s safe to say it wouldn’t take much to shift consumer sentiment and move investors back into the equity.

https://preview.redd.it/qbonai0tgz1f1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=764337cc7ce1e84df25a66968975a4b272704404

The heatmap of this trade shows how it is profitable, and what we like the most is it monetizes immediately upon a positive movement in the price, so investors do not have to wait till near expiration to cash in. Additionally, the risk is limited to premium only, making this another trade which loses small but wins big.

https://preview.redd.it/caml407vgz1f1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ad2c0788e5245a9295a243da5bf30b8176149dd

On the flip side, for you bears out there, using a strike of 75, we found an 80/75 Put Spread, also expiring in August.

https://preview.redd.it/one3873xgz1f1.png?width=3036&format=png&auto=webp&s=3223b3f5e51973e397531ebfd4ee6a3e868899da

The cost of this trade is slightly above average but at .57c it is still cheap and well within our ideal range.

https://preview.redd.it/mgv2dfsygz1f1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3f1b1193760b89d248f2b115697f70418f10d7b

The heatmap of this trade shows that it also monetizes immediately (being a spread) and gives strong returns with minimal risk. The risk here, again, is limited to premium only, making this another trade that loses small but wins big.

https://preview.redd.it/ilirk5h1hz1f1.png?width=1399&format=png&auto=webp&s=2570c631d4cf4c9660131f05c17315b9419bf502

In conclusion, no one knows which way Target, or any stock will move. That being said, there are cases to be made on either side. I personally am more on the bearish side based on their financials and because they are getting out-performed by competitors but at the end of the day, anything can happen, especially in these markets. Trust your own analysis and use it to take advantage of the trades we provide to maximize your potential returns, while simultaneously minimizing your downside risk.

And as always, it’s better to be lucky than good so good luck to you all.",2025-05-20,0,3

Given its strong brand, consistent cash flow, and dominant market position, it’s clearly a great business. But from a value investing standpoint, the current price seems pretty rich, especially when factoring in growth slowing in key segments and increasing competition.

1k6iede_NET,NET,$TGT – Target is a Sitting Duck. I'm Buying Puts and You Should Too.,"The bull case for Target is dead. I’m loading up on puts like it’s 2008 and this place sells CDOs. Here’s why:

TL;DR:
Consumer spending is falling. Foot traffic is down. Earnings are flat. They're getting wrecked by Walmart, Amazon, and Costco. Their DEI pivot backfired and pissed everyone off. Tariffs are incoming. Margins are about to get smoked. I'm buying puts, and it’s looking real good.

Financials are soft:

Q4 2024 revenue: $30.92B (beat, but barely)

Full-year 2024 net sales: $106.6B, down from $107.4B in 2023

Full-year EPS: $8.86, down from $8.94

Stock is already down 20% over the past year

You can’t spin that into a growth story. Flat is the new down, especially with macro pressure.

People aren’t shopping there anymore:

10 straight weeks of declining in-store foot traffic

Cutting back DEI stuff alienated both sides of the aisle

Costco is scooping up their customers and their lunch

Curbside and online aren’t saving them like they used to

Tariffs + Recession = Profit Implosion:

Trump’s new tariffs are hammering imports from China, Mexico, and Canada

Target has to either eat the cost or pass it to consumers. Both suck.

Their CFO straight-up said consumer spending is cautious and soft

GDP forecast for Q1 2025 is negative. Recession vibes confirmed.

They’re getting crushed from all sides:

Walmart is cheaper and better positioned

Amazon dominates online

Costco is recession-proof and more beloved

Target is stuck in the middle, with no clear value prop

The trade:

Buying more Jan 2026 $70P and $65P

IV still reasonable for now

Tariffs + weak macro + earnings misses = real downside

If this cracks below $90 again, it could fall off a cliff.

Final thought:

This isn’t just a bearish play. This is a breakdown in identity. Target’s stuck trying to please everyone and is failing to please anyone. Consumers are broke, boycotting, and buying bulk from Costco. Their pricing isn't competitive. Their foot traffic is drying up. Their margins are at risk. And their best-case scenario is flat sales. Not exactly a growth story.

Short $TGT. Buy puts. Let the charts do the talking.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barclays-cuts-p-500-target-123326485.html

“March 27 - Barclays (NYSE:BCS) has reduced its 2025 year-end forecast for the S&P 500 to 5,900, down more than 10% from its prior estimate of 6,600, citing the risk of U.S. tariff actions weighing on the economy, according to a Wednesday note.

The index hovered near 5,728 during a volatile session. Barclays said the revised outlook reflects the potential drag from trade restrictions, which are expected to slow U.S. economic activity without triggering a recession.

The bank now projects S&P 500 earnings per share of $262, down from $271. It attributed the downgrade to the Trump administration's plan to implement new reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, including recent increases of 20% on Chinese imports and 25% on steel and aluminum shipments. Some tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada remain temporarily suspended.

Barclays estimated the tariffs could directly reduce S&P 500 earnings by 1.6%, with an additional 0.7% hit if other countries impose retaliatory measures. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and RBC Capital Markets also lowered their S&P 500 targets, to 6,200 and 6,000, respectively.”",2025-03-27,307,58

Broadcom (AVGO) late Thursday beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and forecast sales above views for the current period. AVGO stock rose in extended trading.

The fabless chipmaker and infrastructure software provider earned an adjusted $1.60 a share on sales of $14.92 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 2. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $1.51 a share on sales of $14.62 billion in fiscal Q1. On a year-over-year basis, Broadcom earnings increased 45% while sales advanced 25%.

1j46ec6_TGT,TGT,TGT is in the worst shape it’s been in years,"A 40 day boycott of Target has been announced. Who knows if this will amount to much, but after releasing lackluster earnings and forecast last week, the retailer looks to be in one of the worst positions in recent years. 



Consumer spending looks to be contracting. People are increasingly price conscious and Target is neither a high end retailer whose customers will shrug off cost increases nor a true value shop that will minimize costs. Target ceo said that they would raise prices in response to tariffs. 



It looks like a perfect storm is hitting Target. A weak consumer. A disturbance of the middle tier retail niche. Inflation and tariffs raising prices and compressing margins. And very poor sentiment among their consumers. 


I was a big target supporter around 2019-2022 but it looks like everything broke wrong for the retailer and they have nothing but headwinds ahead. I no longer have a position in TGT after selling my total holding right about flat earlier this year.

NOW LOOK AT ATAI.

This is the psychedelic medical stock that we have been following and enjoying in the run up to RFK's confirmation.

Look at that monthly base!!

Once that breaks, that is absolutely primed to rip higher towards 5 or 6 IMO. 

Currently trading at **$1.99**, and just recently, insiders have been snapping up a significant block of shares. Here's a quick snapshot:

* **Current Price:** $1.99
* One of the major institutional holders is Peter Thiel
* RFK has already been vocal on his support of increasing psychedelic drug access as a viable medical approach
* **Float:** 121.94M
* **Short Float:** 9.27%
* **Market Cap:** \~$334M
* **RSI (14):** \~52

Fundamentally, ATAI is one of this year's top psychedelic picks. ATAI's sitting at a cool 0.18 debt/equity ratio with 100M+ in float showing financial stability (great long term pick for the year) and modest institutional ownership.

The firm also anticipates that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will agree to be involved in managing IFS, under conditions that would be favorable to them.

The value of the account in terms of money injected and withdrawn will fluctuate as I have a couple of trading pots (to diversify risk). I'm looking to make and use £100k in this account by the end of 2025.

All things going well, I generally won't pull any money out of this pot for the rest of the year so it should snowball. If the £100k target is hit in crystallised profit, then the next target will be £200k and £300k and so on. 

I would love to hit the £1M target by the end of 2025 but let's not set the bar too high and risk it all. 

BTW, ignore the 'targets' on the screenshot. I haven't set them up properly.

AMA, happy to share insights.

I mainly trade the DOW Jones INDEX, WTI OIL in this account but occasionally I will scalp on stocks like Tesla, MSTR, NVDA, AMAZON when my system shows a very high chance of a quick win, but I'm not at all heavy on stocks in my trading account, more so they are bought in my other shares account. 

As you'll see, I trade lots of positions daily, and go both long and short at the same time to scalp as much as possible between ranges. I have a pretty solid suite of indicators that show me entry points at 5 different timeframes so I have both super short term opportunities (15 min time frame) and longer term opportunities (2 hour timeframe) covering hours or days. 

I also run another trading account with DOW Jones and WTI oil positions but that's a lot less risky.  

I generally find that my indicator setup works really well on the big cap stocks for swing trading but I generally avoid trading those as I don't like the risk of events occuring when the markets close over night (even if there are aftermarket extended hours). With commodities and indices, price is provided 24/5 via the brokers algo so it helps me to react to any global/political/economic events faster. ",2025-02-16,94,43
1ip3nzj_PLTR,PLTR,"ABAT, A company which can give you 10x returns based on the analysts' target price and the reason why.","I have been following on the stock ABAT for a few months and I do believe it has **Hugh** potentials. Before I explain why, let me introduce this company first.

**Company Introduction:**

American Battery Technology Co: It engages in lithium battery recycling, battery metals and materials extraction and resource production; focusing on low-cost clean energy technologies.

Capital Markets: **ONLY 100 Million**

Price:1.3 per share

Earnings date: February 14, 2025.

**Bullish Reasons：**

Lithium batteries are widely used in:

1.Aviation

2.EVs

[3.Energy](http://3.Energy) storage and

4.Humanoid robots (these robots will use lithium batteries as well).

Look at the industries above, I believe i don't need to explain why Aviation and EVs will be developed a lots by the new government. Humanoid robots is a hot topic and lots of big technology companies are working on it. Therefore, I'm very Bullish on Lithium batteries related companies (ABAT, MVST, KULR). The only difference for ABAT is that it's a renewable technology and it has a really good relationships with the government.

**Good Government Relationships:**

Look at the support they got from the government recently:

1. December 18, 2024, ABAT was awarded a grant contract valued at **$144 million** by the US Department of Energy. This funding is specifically allocated for constructing its second commercial-scale lithium-ion battery recycling facility.

2.October 15, 2024, Through the 48C tax credit program, ABAT received over **$60 million** to support its research and development initiatives as well as to expand production capacity.

3.January 10, 2025, ABAT secured an additional funding package of **$70 million** from the U.S. Department of Energy.

We all know having a good relationship with government now is very important (i.e., PLTR, BBAI, OKLO). I believe it will receive more support from the government in future.

**One of the largest known lithium resources in the United States**

According to the news on January 21:

""American Battery Technology Announces New Drill Program To Boost Tonopah Flats Lithium Project; **21.2M Tons** Lithium Resource Identified; Prefeasibility Study Underway With Truth North Drilling And Barr Engineering; Plans 30K Ton/Year Lithium Hydroxide Refinery With Black & Veatch

In April 2024, American Battery Technology Company (ABTC) published its Amended Initial Assessment, which concluded that the TFLP **is one of the largest known lithium resources in the United States,** containing approximately 21.2 million tons of economically accessible lithium (LCE), and that commercial quantities of battery grade lithium hydroxide could be manufactured at a production cost of **$4,302/ton**.""

This company already has a good foundation and abundant resources. When it can be mined one day, its cost advantage will be huge.

**Financials**

ABAT published their FY25 Q2 quarterly earnings and shared impressive improvements/progress:

ABTC successfully implemented several key process enhancements to its first battery recycling near Reno, Nevada during the quarter. This required a temporary pause in operations, and resulted in significant increases in subsequent plant throughput:

1. Facility throughput in January 2025 was greater than **2.25x** the average monthly throughput in the previous quarter.

2.Facility throughput in the first week of February 2025 was greater than **3.5x** the average weekly throughput in the previous quarter.

As the company has engaged with several OEMs for larger quantities of battery feed material than could be processed at its first battery recycling facility, ABTC is in the process of establishing a **second** battery recycling facility with approximately **5 times** the throughput capacity of its first facility. On December 18, 2024, the company received a contract for a competitive grant award for $144 million of federal investment from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support the development and construction of this second facility.

Based on these demonstrated technologies, ABTC is designing and intends to construct a 30,000 tonne LiOH per year commercial scale refinery near Tonopah, Nevada, and has been awarded a **$57.7 million** competitive grant from the US DOE to support this project.

**Potential Opportunities/Trigger**

Currently the most of Lithium batteries are from Asia and the resources of Lithium batteries are from Austria and the South America.  Considering the potential tariffs for other countries, I could expect these countries will do the same to America and restrict some specific products. Actually, the country where we import the most lithium batteries considered to ban it already. You can find the news easily (I can not embed the link otherwise my post will be banned, but you can just search for the key words to find the same news).

So, according to the news, and the these MAGA, I believe American Lithium batteries will have more opportunities and support from the government.

**Target Price:**

2 Months ago, the price was more than **4** dollars and based on the analysts, the target price is **9 dollars**. So, I would expect the price will be more than 4 dollars for sure.

**Others:**

Look at the rate, It's also ez to be squeezed！

**Positions:**

I don't have too much money, so I only have 400 stocks and 4 calls which expiry date is August 15, 2025, and the strike price is 1 dollar.

**Conclusion**:

As clear energy becomes a global trend, will you choose to miss out? As lithium battery recycling becomes an inevitable path, will you choose to ignore it? As ABAT stands at forefront, will you choose to stand still? If we expect America to seize the future of new energy, why not start by investing in ABAT?

**Yesterday, Kyle Peterson a 4.06-star Wall Street Analyst at Needham also raised the price target from $13 to $20 with a buy rating. He was the first to ask questions at Monday's Earnings Call Q&A.**

***Mizuho:***

""The firm's analyst highlighted the underlying strength of SoFi's business, pointing to robust fundamentals and a positive medium-term revenue guide for 2025 as reasons for the price target uplift. This optimism is supported by SoFi's impressive 27.8% revenue growth over the last twelve months""

""The analyst emphasized that SoFi's strategic investments are expected to continue to drive its customer acquisition momentum, as evidenced by the growing ratio of Financial Services products to Lending products, which has increased to 6.3 times from 5.7 times in 2023.""

""Furthermore, the analyst noted that many of the negative arguments previously held against SoFi have been addressed. One of the key indicators of improvement is the continued decline in net charge-offs (NCOs), which has persisted even after accounting for sales of delinquent loans.""

""SoFi continues to demonstrate its ability to execute on its growth strategy.""

***Needham:***

""Analyst Kyle Peterson highlighted SoFi’s strong Q4 performance, driven by higher net interest income and a non-recurring tax benefit that boosted capital ratios. 

Peterson viewed the 10% pullback in shares as a buying opportunity, emphasizing future growth from high-profile deals such as the U.S. Treasury Direct program and capital-light tailwinds from a major loan platform deal with Blue Owl Capital, both expected to contribute meaningfully by FY2026.

This is a testament to our tech platform's differentiated offering as well as our strength and reliability. We're excited about the integration that will take place in 2025 and the **financial impact that we will see in 2026**.""

""We ***just signed a large U.S.-based financial services provider*** that offers short-term consumer loans, card services, check cashing, and other financial products.

> **All but one of the 21 analysts covering the company who are tracked by Visible Alpha maintain a “buy” or equivalent rating,** with analysts at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Bernstein recently naming it a ""top pick."" **The consensus price target is about $177,** a roughly 18% premium over the chipmaker’s intraday level Monday.  

After the keynote:

> Bank of America: “We highlight NVDA’s continued dominance in genAI compute and ecosystem, quickly expanding from the cloud all the way to enterprise and consumers. **Maintain Buy on our top sector pick.”**

> Stifel: “Nvidia's announcements today are significant, but long-tailed. We view these developments as further deepening the company's competitive moat and positioning around potentially multi-billion dollar advancements tied to AI agents, robotics, autonomous vehicles, graphics and PC and edge-device inferences in the coming years.”

> Meanwhile, for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analysts, key takeaways from the keynote were the introduction of the new RTX 50-series GPUs, the announcement that Blackwell is now in full production, AI scaling expansion, and expectations that the company’s automotive business could grow to around $5 billion by fiscal 2026.

> Lastly, Wedbush analysts said Huang’s CES speech “felt more like a rock concert vibe than a tech CEO speech.”

> “The overriding message from Jensen was a slew of new AI technology is coming out of Nvidia around robotics, autonomous technology, PCs that will further stretch their enormous technology lead vs. the rest of the semi and Big Tech landscape,” analysts noted.

> “This was a major ""flex the muscles"" moment for Nvidia and Jensen in this AI arms race playing out across the tech ecosystem globally.”

Article from [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-cuts-nvidia-stock-target-after-deepseek-release-3833846), *Morgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release* by Sam Boughedda, Published 01/28/2025, 06:25 AM

> Morgan Stanley lowered its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $166 to **$152** on Tuesday, citing investor concerns sparked by the release of DeepSeek’s AI model. 

So if 20 out of 21 analysts maintained a “buy” or equivalent rating with a price target of about $177 before CES, Benchmark  and Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating with a $190 price target after CES, and even now Morgan Stanley says it has a price target of $152...

Then why did Wall Street sell NVDA from ~$142 down to ~$118?  

Are we to believe that Wall Street, with all their analysts, researchers, and quants, decided at a drop of a hat to ignore their own price targets and dump what they themselves described as an undervalued stock, or are they seeing something that retail isn't yet pricing in?  

Finally, for the hell of it:

> The truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. Had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is, a hat trick in a medicine show, a fevered dream, a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue nor precedent, an itinerant carnival, a migratory tentshow whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning.

> The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its own order and that no man's mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.

1i3jek2_TSLA,TSLA,Intel Shares Jump on Report It’s an Acquisition Target,"Intel Corp. shares jumped as much as 9.5% Friday morning after a report on a technology news site said the beleaguered chipmaker is an acquisition target.

SemiAccurate, a tech-focused newsletter founded by Charlie Demerjian, said it was “read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole” and that the “mystery company has the resources to pull it off.” The report did not name the firm potentially interested in buying Intel.

Once the world’s dominant chipmaker, Intel has struggled in recent years to keep up in a competitive and fast-changing industry. Last month, Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the iconic company. Its stock fell 60% last year, and the shares are only now back at their level from early December. Its market valuation is about $90 billion.

Buyers have circled Intel even before Gelsinger’s ouster and takeover speculation has accelerated since then. Qualcomm Inc. approached Intel to discuss a potential acquisition before eventually cooling on the idea, Bloomberg reported last year. Arm Holdings Plc similarly inquired about possibly buying Intel’s product division, but was told the business wasn’t for sale, Bloomberg reported in September.

Intel couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

# Meta to Cut Roughly 5% of Staff, Targeting Lowest Performers

In a move that feels like déjà vu, Meta announced it’s cutting about 5% of its workforce—or around 3,600 jobs—by February. But this round of cuts isn’t about reducing costs—it’s about raising the performance bar. In a memo to employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wants to “move out low performers faster” and focus on assembling the best talent as Meta gears up for an “intense year” of building in AI, smart glasses, and the future of social media.

**A Balancing Act**

While some roles are being slashed, new ones are being created. Meta plans to backfill these positions later this year, signaling that the company is doubling down on key growth areas. However, Wall Street didn’t exactly cheer—shares fell more than 2% after the announcement.

The memo also comes on the heels of other major changes, including the end of Meta’s fact-checking program and a rollback of diversity efforts, moves that some see as attempts to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration.

**Raising Eyebrows**

Zuckerberg’s efficiency push has sparked internal debate, with some employees questioning whether these cuts disproportionately affect underrepresented groups—especially after recent comments about fostering more ""masculine energy"" in corporate culture. And while Meta says the focus is on boosting performance, critics argue the policy shifts could further erode trust among its workforce, particularly in areas tied to inclusion and oversight.

**The Bigger Picture**

Zuckerberg’s focus on efficiency isn’t new—he dubbed 2023 as Meta’s ""year of efficiency"" and cut over 20,000 roles across the company. Now, he’s positioning Meta to stay competitive as it pivots toward AI-led growth. But this time, the cuts have reignited concerns about whether Meta can pull off this balancing act without losing its edge—or its people.

# Intel to Turn Venture Arm Into Separate Firm With New Name

Intel is spinning off its venture capital arm, Intel Capital, into an independent investment fund, aiming to inject new energy (and new money) into its operations. Intel, which will stay on as an anchor investor, says the standalone fund will start operating under a new name in the second half of 2025, boasting over $5 billion in assets under management.

The move is all about flexibility. By stepping out of Intel’s shadow, Intel Capital can raise funds from external backers while continuing to make strategic bets on innovative startups. The current Intel Capital team will transition to the new entity, and day-to-day operations will carry on without interruption. Interim co-CEO David Zinsner called the split a ""win-win"" that unlocks new capital while keeping Intel’s strategic partnership intact.

**A Legacy of Bold Bets**

Intel Capital, established in 1991, was a pioneer in corporate venture capital. Over the years, it has invested more than $20 billion in over 1,800 companies, with a portfolio spanning AI, cloud, 5G, and robotics. Its big-name bets include AI chipmaker SambaNova and robotics firm Figure, proving that it knows how to pick winners in the tech game.

But this spinoff isn’t happening in a vacuum. Intel has faced significant headwinds, reporting a record $16.6 billion quarterly loss last year—the largest in its history. To turn things around, the company launched a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that included shedding 15,000 jobs and spinning off other divisions like its FPGA business, Altera.

**The Bigger Picture**

While Intel Capital’s newfound independence mirrors similar moves in Silicon Valley (think SAP’s Sapphire Ventures), it underscores Intel’s broader effort to regain its footing amid fierce competition. As Nvidia and AMD dominate the chip scene, Intel’s restructuring is a bet on long-term survival and reinvention.

For Intel Capital, this next chapter presents an opportunity to expand its venture portfolio while navigating the complex landscape of global tech. Meanwhile, Intel’s future depends on whether it can turn its renewed focus on cutting-edge chipmaking into a comeback story worth watching.

# Meta to Cut Roughly 5% of Staff, Targeting Lowest Performers

In a move that feels like déjà vu, Meta announced it’s cutting about 5% of its workforce—or around 3,600 jobs—by February. But this round of cuts isn’t about reducing costs—it’s about raising the performance bar. In a memo to employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wants to “move out low performers faster” and focus on assembling the best talent as Meta gears up for an “intense year” of building in AI, smart glasses, and the future of social media.

**A Balancing Act**

While some roles are being slashed, new ones are being created. Meta plans to backfill these positions later this year, signaling that the company is doubling down on key growth areas. However, Wall Street didn’t exactly cheer—shares fell more than 2% after the announcement.

The memo also comes on the heels of other major changes, including the end of Meta’s fact-checking program and a rollback of diversity efforts, moves that some see as attempts to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration.

**Raising Eyebrows**

Zuckerberg’s efficiency push has sparked internal debate, with some employees questioning whether these cuts disproportionately affect underrepresented groups—especially after recent comments about fostering more ""masculine energy"" in corporate culture. And while Meta says the focus is on boosting performance, critics argue the policy shifts could further erode trust among its workforce, particularly in areas tied to inclusion and oversight.

**The Bigger Picture**

Zuckerberg’s focus on efficiency isn’t new—he dubbed 2023 as Meta’s ""year of efficiency"" and cut over 20,000 roles across the company. Now, he’s positioning Meta to stay competitive as it pivots toward AI-led growth. But this time, the cuts have reignited concerns about whether Meta can pull off this balancing act without losing its edge—or its people.

# Intel to Turn Venture Arm Into Separate Firm With New Name

Intel is spinning off its venture capital arm, Intel Capital, into an independent investment fund, aiming to inject new energy (and new money) into its operations. Intel, which will stay on as an anchor investor, says the standalone fund will start operating under a new name in the second half of 2025, boasting over $5 billion in assets under management.

The move is all about flexibility. By stepping out of Intel’s shadow, Intel Capital can raise funds from external backers while continuing to make strategic bets on innovative startups. The current Intel Capital team will transition to the new entity, and day-to-day operations will carry on without interruption. Interim co-CEO David Zinsner called the split a ""win-win"" that unlocks new capital while keeping Intel’s strategic partnership intact.

**A Legacy of Bold Bets**

Intel Capital, established in 1991, was a pioneer in corporate venture capital. Over the years, it has invested more than $20 billion in over 1,800 companies, with a portfolio spanning AI, cloud, 5G, and robotics. Its big-name bets include AI chipmaker SambaNova and robotics firm Figure, proving that it knows how to pick winners in the tech game.

But this spinoff isn’t happening in a vacuum. Intel has faced significant headwinds, reporting a record $16.6 billion quarterly loss last year—the largest in its history. To turn things around, the company launched a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that included shedding 15,000 jobs and spinning off other divisions like its FPGA business, Altera.

**The Bigger Picture**

While Intel Capital’s newfound independence mirrors similar moves in Silicon Valley (think SAP’s Sapphire Ventures), it underscores Intel’s broader effort to regain its footing amid fierce competition. As Nvidia and AMD dominate the chip scene, Intel’s restructuring is a bet on long-term survival and reinvention.

For Intel Capital, this next chapter presents an opportunity to expand its venture portfolio while navigating the complex landscape of global tech. Meanwhile, Intel’s future depends on whether it can turn its renewed focus on cutting-edge chipmaking into a comeback story worth watching.

Anteris Technologies (AVR) has caught the attention of analysts with its innovative DurAVR valve system, leading to ambitious price targets. Barclays set the most optimistic target at $22, citing the system’s potential to disrupt the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market and capture 4-5% of the U.S. market by 2030. TD Cowen follows with a $15 target, while Cantor Fitzgerald takes a more conservative approach at $9. These targets reflect confidence in Anteris’s growth prospects, though they also highlight varying levels of caution regarding the company’s ability to scale in a competitive space.

1hasyvf_AAPL,AAPL,Use options to create informed profit and loss targets ,"Tl:Dr; ALWAYS set P&L targets for every single trade before entry. You can use option probabilities to quantify the likelihood. Delta is okay to use as an approximation for PITM but has notable variance further out in time.

One of the easiest things you can do to completely transform your trading overnight is to ALWAYS set a predefined profit and loss target for EVERY SINGLE TRADE before it’s placed. One of the really cool things about options, is it can help quantify the probabilities for you.

First, defining profit and loss targets BEFORE entry is key for several reasons: 1. it avoids emotional decision making; 2. it prevents the disposition effect where we have a tendency to take winning trades down too fast and let losers run; 3. it allows us to verify we’re taking a trade with positively expectant risk to reward ratios.

Defining profit a loss targets can be challenging because we might have ideas around where we might WANT something to go but that doesn’t mean it’ll go there. Enter the probability function of options.

We can use options to quantify the probabilities of where we might think a stock may go along with what our P&L might be at those levels to calculate the expected return of a trade before entering. Having positive expectation doesn’t mean the trade WILL be profitable, but it means over a larger sample, the results will trend towards that figure.

Let’s say you think AAPL might hit 300 sometime in the next 6 months, we can use options to actually quantify this probability across commensurate timeframes. Within the next 193 days, it currently has a 23.25% probability of touching 300. Over the next 39, it’s a 0.74% chance. We can calculate the expected return for the individual trade and see if it’s positively expectant and if it falls inline with the general performance of the specific strategy we’re planning to use.

Now, you’ve likely heard you can use delta. Which is mostly true but not fully accurate. The formula for calculating delta is very similar to calculating an options probability of being ITM. However, using delta as an approximation can lead to significant deviation as we move further out in time. In general, it’s fine to use for shorter term expectations (<30 days or so) but beyond that, using PITM is smarter (there’s literally no reason not to use it outside of pure laziness).

As an example. As of today, if I look at the 20Dec 265 call it has a delta of 0.02. This would infer a 2% probability of being ITM at expiration and a 4% probability of a touch. The calculated probabilities are 1.97% PITM and 3.92% PT. Very close, works fine.

The 20Jun 300C has a delta of 0.15 (15% PITM & 30% PT inferred). The calculated probabilities are 12% PITM and 23.24% PT. This deviation widens the further out in time we go and can be exacerbated by higher volatility.

One final note is that we do NOT need to fully exit a trade once it hits our profit target. We can always take partial profits, set stops, etc. However, the loss side is non-negotiable (see the disposition effect and loss aversion).",2024-12-10,38,10

# Nvidia’s AI Crown Is Getting Heavier

Nvidia’s AI-fueled rocket ship is still flying high—but signs of turbulence are emerging. 

The chip kingpin posted a 94% revenue surge to $35.1 billion last quarter, with profits nearly doubling to $19.3 billion. It also projected $37.5 billion in revenue for the next quarter, fueled by Blackwell, its latest AI chip that’s as coveted as a golden ticket to Willy Wonka’s factory.

The results are a testament to Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips, which remain the go-to choice for companies scaling up their AI capabilities. But after several quarters of jaw-dropping growth, some investors are wondering if Nvidia’s star is starting to dim.

**Chipping In Everywhere**

Nvidia’s data center division—the heart of its AI boom—brought in $30.8 billion, a 112% jump. Blackwell chips are already powering big names like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI, though demand is expected to outweigh supply well into 2026.

The gaming segment didn’t sit idle either, contributing $3.28 billion, driven by GPUs and Nintendo Switch console chips. Even the smaller automotive division revved up, with a 72% sales increase thanks to its self-driving car tech and robotics chips.

Nvidia’s AI dominance is also opening new doors, from drug discovery to sovereign AI investments—markets that could add billions in the coming years.

**Clouds Over Sunny Skies**

Despite the blockbuster numbers, Nvidia’s stock slipped 2% in after-hours trading. Why? Growth is slowing—albeit from sky-high levels—and competition is heating up. Rivals like AMD are sniffing around, while tech giants like Amazon and Google are building their own chips to cut reliance on Nvidia. 

Meanwhile, regulators in the U.S. and Europe are eyeing Nvidia’s more-than-80% share of the AI chip market, raising concerns about monopolistic practices. Add to that some engineering hiccups with Blackwell’s rollout, and the once-smooth journey has hit a few bumps.

**The AI Marathon**

For now, Nvidia’s dominance is unquestionable, but sustaining its meteoric rise won’t be easy. CEO Jensen Huang, who’s gone from chip visionary to tech icon, knows the AI race is a marathon, not a sprint. 

As Nvidia eyes opportunities in AI-powered robotics, national AI initiatives, and next-gen chips, the stakes have never been higher. 

While Huang works to outpace competitors and placate regulators, one thing is clear: the race to stay on top will be just as intense as the rise to get there.

# Target Shares Tumble on Earnings Miss

Target’s turnaround plans are feeling more like a Target cart with a wonky wheel. 

Shares nosedived 21% on Wednesday after the retailer reported disappointing quarterly results and slashed its profit outlook. Shoppers are skipping the nonessentials—like that one decorative throw pillow you didn’t need anyway—and Target’s attempts to avoid supply chain issues backfired, leaving it with bloated inventories. 

Meanwhile, Walmart’s stellar quarter only underscored Target’s struggles, making CEO Brian Cornell’s job of reviving the brand look even tougher.

**Walmart’s Got the Juice**

If Target’s struggling, Walmart’s thriving. The retail titan notched a 5.3% jump in U.S. comparable sales, boosted by growth in groceries and discretionary items like clothing. 

Costco is also flexing, with strong sales in jewelry and home goods. The key difference? Walmart is cleaning up by appealing to inflation-weary shoppers looking for low prices, while Target’s higher costs and focus on discretionary goods are scaring off budget-conscious buyers. In the battle for retail dominance, Walmart is leaving Target in the dust.

**Too Little, Too Late?**

Target’s efforts to recover—like price cuts on essentials and expanding private-label brands—aren’t landing as planned. Sure, there were some bright spots: foot traffic rose 2.4% and beauty sales sparkled, but overall, it wasn’t enough to counter sluggish demand for big-ticket items. 

Add to that a holiday season overshadowed by cautious consumers, and you’ve got analysts downgrading the stock faster than shoppers heading to Walmart’s aisles.

**What’s the Play Now?**

Cornell says Target is gearing up for the holidays, banking on stocked shelves and competitive pricing to woo customers. But with discretionary spending in the slump and whispers of tariffs under a new administration, the road to recovery looks bumpy at best.

If Target wants to win back shoppers, it’ll need more than discounts—it’ll need a hit that even Walmart can’t beat.

Buckle up—tomorrow’s data dump is packed.

First, we’ll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there’s the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don’t get too excited—tomorrow’s forecast calls for a big ol’ zero in growth.

# Nvidia’s AI Crown Is Getting Heavier

Nvidia’s AI-fueled rocket ship is still flying high—but signs of turbulence are emerging. 

The chip kingpin posted a 94% revenue surge to $35.1 billion last quarter, with profits nearly doubling to $19.3 billion. It also projected $37.5 billion in revenue for the next quarter, fueled by Blackwell, its latest AI chip that’s as coveted as a golden ticket to Willy Wonka’s factory.

The results are a testament to Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips, which remain the go-to choice for companies scaling up their AI capabilities. But after several quarters of jaw-dropping growth, some investors are wondering if Nvidia’s star is starting to dim.

For now, Nvidia’s dominance is unquestionable, but sustaining its meteoric rise won’t be easy. CEO Jensen Huang, who’s gone from chip visionary to tech icon, knows the AI race is a marathon, not a sprint. 

As Nvidia eyes opportunities in AI-powered robotics, national AI initiatives, and next-gen chips, the stakes have never been higher. 

While Huang works to outpace competitors and placate regulators, one thing is clear: the race to stay on top will be just as intense as the rise to get there.

# Target Shares Tumble on Earnings Miss

Target’s turnaround plans are feeling more like a Target cart with a wonky wheel. 

Shares nosedived 21% on Wednesday after the retailer reported disappointing quarterly results and slashed its profit outlook. Shoppers are skipping the nonessentials—like that one decorative throw pillow you didn’t need anyway—and Target’s attempts to avoid supply chain issues backfired, leaving it with bloated inventories. 

Meanwhile, Walmart’s stellar quarter only underscored Target’s struggles, making CEO Brian Cornell’s job of reviving the brand look even tougher.

**Walmart’s Got the Juice**

If Target’s struggling, Walmart’s thriving. The retail titan notched a 5.3% jump in U.S. comparable sales, boosted by growth in groceries and discretionary items like clothing. 

Costco is also flexing, with strong sales in jewelry and home goods. The key difference? Walmart is cleaning up by appealing to inflation-weary shoppers looking for low prices, while Target’s higher costs and focus on discretionary goods are scaring off budget-conscious buyers. In the battle for retail dominance, Walmart is leaving Target in the dust.

**Too Little, Too Late?**

Target’s efforts to recover—like price cuts on essentials and expanding private-label brands—aren’t landing as planned. Sure, there were some bright spots: foot traffic rose 2.4% and beauty sales sparkled, but overall, it wasn’t enough to counter sluggish demand for big-ticket items. 

Add to that a holiday season overshadowed by cautious consumers, and you’ve got analysts downgrading the stock faster than shoppers heading to Walmart’s aisles.

**What’s the Play Now?**

Cornell says Target is gearing up for the holidays, banking on stocked shelves and competitive pricing to woo customers. But with discretionary spending in the slump and whispers of tariffs under a new administration, the road to recovery looks bumpy at best.

If Target wants to win back shoppers, it’ll need more than discounts—it’ll need a hit that even Walmart can’t beat.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Buckle up—tomorrow’s data dump is packed.

First, we’ll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there’s the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don’t get too excited—tomorrow’s forecast calls for a big ol’ zero in growth.

# After Market Close:

* **Intuit** was set for a pretty routine earnings call tomorrow—modest growth, nothing groundbreaking—until news broke about a potential curveball from Washington. Reports suggest the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency is eyeing a free tax-filing app that could sideline tax prep giants like Intuit. This development has likely raised some eyebrows among shareholders, who’ll be eager to hear how the company plans to counter the looming threat. Analysts are projecting $2.35 EPS on $3.14 billion in revenue, but all ears will be on how Intuit navigates this government shake-up. ($INTU)",2024-11-21,2,0

# Nvidia’s AI Crown Is Getting Heavier

Nvidia’s AI-fueled rocket ship is still flying high—but signs of turbulence are emerging. 

The chip kingpin posted a 94% revenue surge to $35.1 billion last quarter, with profits nearly doubling to $19.3 billion. It also projected $37.5 billion in revenue for the next quarter, fueled by Blackwell, its latest AI chip that’s as coveted as a golden ticket to Willy Wonka’s factory.

The results are a testament to Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips, which remain the go-to choice for companies scaling up their AI capabilities. But after several quarters of jaw-dropping growth, some investors are wondering if Nvidia’s star is starting to dim.

**Chipping In Everywhere**

Nvidia’s data center division—the heart of its AI boom—brought in $30.8 billion, a 112% jump. Blackwell chips are already powering big names like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI, though demand is expected to outweigh supply well into 2026.

The gaming segment didn’t sit idle either, contributing $3.28 billion, driven by GPUs and Nintendo Switch console chips. Even the smaller automotive division revved up, with a 72% sales increase thanks to its self-driving car tech and robotics chips.

Nvidia’s AI dominance is also opening new doors, from drug discovery to sovereign AI investments—markets that could add billions in the coming years.

**Clouds Over Sunny Skies**

Despite the blockbuster numbers, Nvidia’s stock slipped 2% in after-hours trading. Why? Growth is slowing—albeit from sky-high levels—and competition is heating up. Rivals like AMD are sniffing around, while tech giants like Amazon and Google are building their own chips to cut reliance on Nvidia. 

Meanwhile, regulators in the U.S. and Europe are eyeing Nvidia’s more-than-80% share of the AI chip market, raising concerns about monopolistic practices. Add to that some engineering hiccups with Blackwell’s rollout, and the once-smooth journey has hit a few bumps.

**The AI Marathon**

For now, Nvidia’s dominance is unquestionable, but sustaining its meteoric rise won’t be easy. CEO Jensen Huang, who’s gone from chip visionary to tech icon, knows the AI race is a marathon, not a sprint. 

As Nvidia eyes opportunities in AI-powered robotics, national AI initiatives, and next-gen chips, the stakes have never been higher.

1f9mvzs_AMZN,AMZN,Walgreens is a easy buyout target,"And I think Amazon should buy them.

Drug stores have evolved from the time they first popped up and people love shopping there because its, convenient.  

Pros

-Amazon is an online retailer with no real retail space yet. Their first stores weren't done right. 

-Amazon already has an online medical clinic(One Medical) and pharmacy business that could be easily integrated together.

-Amazon with their analytics could easily stock each store and location with the right products from their online inventory making each store more profitable.

-Amazon has high shipping/delivery costs and growing each year. people are starting to have a package theft issue. Your local store can easily become a pick up spot of your packages, safely. Whole foods stores are very limited for pick up, same with pick up lockers. 

-Would also be a good returns spot, no need for Kohls or UPS eating into costs. 

-Could have bigger stores in some locations for a bigger variety of products and services. Kroger's has some grocery stores and some marketplace stores. Amazon is essentially a giant warehouse that has to ship everything to your doorstep. 

-Amazon is launching a Shein and Temu competitor, stores could easily offer cheaper products in the right neighborhoods. What usually deters people from making a purchase is the shipping cost, nobody wants to order $35 of stuff just to avoid the shipping fee, plus tax.  



-Walgreens 

	-more than 8,700 retail locations across the U.S.

	-annual revenue for 2023 was $1451B, Amzn makes this in a quarter

	  (1) Pharmacy:	         $87B 60%

	  (2) Retail:	         $37B 26%

	  (3) Wholesale & Others:$20B 14%

	-Walgreens owns Alliance Boots, a retail pharmacy/beauty store across the UK: https://www.boots-uk.com/about-boots-uk/our-purpose-and-values/our-stores/ 

	-Boots owns The No7 Beauty Company:  https://www.no7company.com/

	-Most importantly Walgreens has ALOT if not most of their stores in busy high traffic areas making their locations valuable and offers convenience shopping. 

	

Cons

-Walgreens has $32B in debt

-Might need regulatory approval but Whole Foods got approved so this shouldn't be much of a problem 

-Will likely need to close some unprofitable stores and sell the land or transform them into something else



This deal makes more sense than Amazon buying Whole Foods, and they already have this retail experience. If Amazon doesn't make an offer i think a private equity company will take it private and turn the business around. 



I like the stock. Amazons acquisition would revitalize the brand and bring new excitement if done right.  Bought some shares because they are cheap and this is way over sold.

Can someone simply tell me how to solve this? For instance:

PLTR is at a 70 billion market cap and currently trades around $30. 

If PLTR were to get to a 1 trillion market cap, how much would the price be?

1exmpzs_TGT,TGT,"Target beats on earnings and revenue, but gives cautious sales outlook for the year  ","Target said Wednesday that sales grew about 3% in its fiscal second quarter, a return to growth after a prolonged stretch of sluggish sales and squeezed profits.

The discounter beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations, as shoppers made more visits to Target’s stores and website and bought more discretionary items like clothing.

Even so, the company stuck by its previous full-year sales forecast and struck a cautious note. Target said it expects comparable sales for the full year to range from flat to up 2%, but said it now expects the increase will likely be in the lower half of the range. 

Target raised its profit guidance, however, saying it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $9 to $9.70, up from the previous range of $8.60 and $9.60.

Shares rose more than 10% in premarket trading as Target showed improvement in generating profits.

On a call with reporters, Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke said Target took a “measured approach” with its outlook because it’s hard to predict consumers’ mindsets and the state of the economy in the coming months.

“While we’ve been pleased with our performance so far this year, and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high,” he said.

Here’s what Target reported for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.57 vs. $2.18 expected

Revenue: $25.45 billion vs. $25.21 billion expected

Target, known for its wide array of trendy but low-priced merchandise, has been hurt as consumers buy fewer items like new outfits or home decor while they pay more for everyday expenses like food and housing. The big-box retailer has also struggled with reduced profits in recent quarters, as customers bought items like groceries that tend to be lower margin, and losses from damaged inventory and theft, including organized retail crime, took a toll.

Those trends improved in the second quarter, as Target attracted shoppers with new merchandise and reduced prices.

Target’s net income jumped to $1.19 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $835 million, or $1.80 per share, in the year-ago quarter. That’s a more than 40% year-over-year increase.

Total revenue rose from $24.77 billion in the prior year.

Comparable sales rose 2% in the quarter, the first time in five quarters that Target posted a gain. The industry metric tracks sales online and at stores open at least 13 months.

Digital sales drove most of those gains, growing 8.7% in the quarter, as more customers used same-day services like curbside pickup and home delivery. Comparable store sales rose slightly, up 0.7%.

Target has tried to rev up sales and drive higher foot traffic by deepening loyalty and offering discounts. The company relaunched its loyalty program early this year and introduced a new paid membership, Target Circle 360, that includes perks like free same-day deliveries. Target threw its own sales event in July to compete with Amazon’s Prime Day. And it announced in May that it would cut prices on about 5,000 frequently bought items, including diapers, milk and paper towels. 

CEO Brian Cornell said customers have responded well to the price cuts and credited them for contributing to traffic growth in the quarter. 

Customer traffic across Target’s website and store grew 3% in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. The average size of customers’ shopping baskets, however, declined slightly, Fiddelke said.

Discretionary sales, which have been under pressure across the retail industry, improved. Target said apparel sales, for instance, grew more than 3% in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. 

Back-to-school has also been an important season for the retailer. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a call with reporters that the shopping season has matched Target’s expectations, as many customers gravitate toward items with good value like backpacks that cost $5 and crayons that cost 25 cents. 

He said back-to-college shopping tends to be a longer season, as students gradually decorate their apartments and dorms.

Shares of Target closed on Tuesday at $144.33. As of Tuesday’s close, the company’s stock is up about 1% so far this year. That’s trailed behind the S&P 500′s approximately 17% gains during the same period.

1ehnm3r_JNJ,JNJ,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_JNJ,JNJ,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnkfo_PEP,PEP,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_KO,KO,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnm3r_PFE,PFE,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_PFE,PFE,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnmv3_INTU,INTU,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_JNJ,JNJ,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_MCD,MCD,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

1ehnm3r_MCD,MCD,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_INTU,INTU,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnmv3_MA,MA,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_MA,MA,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnm3r_V,V,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_KO,KO,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnkfo_LLY,LLY,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree.

Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_XOM,XOM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnmv3_CVX,CVX,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_CVX,CVX,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,6,12
1ehnmv3_XOM,XOM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_XOM,XOM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,3,1
1ehnm3r_LLY,LLY,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_UNH,UNH,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,4,12
1ehnmv3_ISRG,ISRG,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_ISRG,ISRG,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,4,12
1ehnmv3_TMO,TMO,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_REGN,REGN,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnm3r_COP,COP,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_COP,COP,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnkfo_REGN,REGN,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_VRTX,VRTX,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,20,23
1ehnkfo_VRTX,VRTX,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_NEE,NEE,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnmv3_NEE,NEE,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_PG,PG,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,2,1
1ehnm3r_PG,PG,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_PG,PG,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,20,23
1ehnmv3_AXP,AXP,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_GS,GS,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnmv3_BAC,BAC,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_CRM,CRM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnkfo_BAC,BAC,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_QCOM,QCOM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnmv3_JPM,JPM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_TXN,TXN,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnmv3_TXN,TXN,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_WFC,WFC,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,5,12
1ehnkfo_AVGO,AVGO,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_AVGO,AVGO,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,6,12
1ehnm3r_KLAC,KLAC,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_KLAC,KLAC,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,4,12
1ehnm3r_LRCX,LRCX,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_PANW,PANW,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnkfo_PANW,PANW,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_LRCX,LRCX,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,6,12
1ehnkfo_QCOM,QCOM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnm3r_QCOM,QCOM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,18,23
1ehnkfo_MS,MS,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_MS,MS,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,19,23
1ehnkfo_AMD,AMD,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_AMZN,AMZN,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,4,12
1ehnm3r_WFC,WFC,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_AAPL,AAPL,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_IBM,IBM,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

1ehnkfo_ORCL,ORCL,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnmv3_ORCL,ORCL,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",2024-08-01,6,12

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1ehnkfo_GS,GS,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1e3vtow_AAPL,AAPL,"Morgan Stanley names Apple as a ""top pick"" for AI efforts, raises price target from $216 to $273 ($4.2T market cap)","(Reuters) -Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a ""top pick,"" citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.

Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.

""Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.

Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.

The stock has an average rating of ""buy"" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.

Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.

Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.",2024-07-15,351,133

1dhf3py_TGT,TGT,"Goldman Sachs Boosts S&P 500 Target on Upbeat Profit Outlook
","Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists have boosted their year-end target for the S&P 500 Index for a third time, reflecting Wall Street’s optimistic outlook for earnings growth and the US economy.The bank’s equity strategists led by David Kostin now see the US stock benchmark index finishing the year at 5,600, up from a 5,200 level they predicted in February. The new target implies a roughly 3% advance in the gauge from its Friday close.Goldman’s upgraded target ties with that from UBS Group AG’s Jonathan Golub and BMO Capital Markets’ Brian Belski for the highest on Wall Street.The upgrade in the target is “driven by milder-than-average negative earnings revisions and a higher fair value P/E multiple,” Kostin, the firm’s chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.



The upgrade comes one month after Kostin reiterated the firm’s 5,200 target, stating there was no further room for upside in the 500-member gauge through December. The firm’s strategists first introduced their 2024 target in November, before raising it in December and again in February. The S&P 500 closed at 5,431.60 on Friday.While the firm’s strategists maintained their earnings-per-share forecast for 2024 and 2025, they noted that robust earnings growth by the top five megacap technology stocks have offset the “typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.” Kostin also raised the S&P 500’s price-earnings multiple he deems fair to 20.4 from 19.5.



Kostin gamed out several other scenarios in which stocks can run even higher than his new baseline forecast. If gains broaden out and lift the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, the main, cap-weighted benchmark could rise another 9% to 5,900 before 2024 closes out. In his most optimistic case, if mega-cap “exceptionalism” persists, the gauge could soar to 6,300 by the end of the year.Conversely, if earnings estimates prove too optimistic or recession fears resurface among investors, the S&P 500 could see a correction of about 13% and fall to 4,700.

1cxx28c_TGT,TGT,"Target's earnings miss, sales fall as consumers buy fewer groceries and home goods ","Target on Wednesday posted a year-over-year sales decline and missed Wall Street’s earnings estimates, as consumers fatigued from high prices bought both fewer discretionary items and groceries. 

The Minneapolis-based discounter’s revenue was about in line with expectations. On a call with reporters, CEO Brian Cornell said the company’s results reflect “continued soft trends in discretionary categories.”

He said the company wants to make sure it offers customers value and communicates that in a clear way, with moves like its relaunched loyalty program. Target also announced Monday it was cutting prices on thousands of everyday items, including milk, bread, paper towels and diapers.

Target stuck with its prior full-year forecast, saying it expects comparable sales will range from flat to up 2% and adjusted earnings per share will be $8.60 to $9.60. 

Here’s what Target reported for the three-month period that ended May 4 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.03 vs. $2.06 expected

Revenue: $24.53 billion vs. $24.52 billion expected

It marked the first time since November 2022 that Target missed earnings expectations. 

Target’s net income for the period fell by less than 1% to $942 million, or $2.03 per share, from $950 million, or $2.05 per share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Total revenue declined about 3% from $25.32 billion in the prior year.

Like other retailers, Target has tried to win over consumers who are not spending as freely on clothing, home goods or other discretionary items. The cheap chic retailer has been particularly hurt by the dynamic because it gets less of its sales from food than rival Walmart, which draws about 60% of its U.S. sales from groceries. That compares to roughly 20% at Target.

Inflation cooled slightly in April, but the consumer price index was still up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. The key measure gauges how much goods and services cost at the cash register.

Target acknowledged that challenge with this week’s price cuts. 

The company is also competing with other discounters, including Walmart, Aldi and Lidl, that are chasing deal-hunting shoppers.

Walmart, for example, has gained market share from higher-income shoppers and recently introduced a premium food brand with most items under $5. The company’s CFO John David Rainey also said last week that customers are turning to its grocery aisles for cheaper meals because of the rising prices of fast food.

Target’s sales challenges

In Target’s first quarter, customer traffic, which includes online and stores, fell 1.9%. The average amount that customers spent on those visits dropped 1.9%, too.

Digital sales grew 1.4%. It marked the first increase in digital sales in more than a year.

Comparable sales, also called same-store sales, tumbled 3.7%, as shoppers bought beauty items but less of other discretionary categories like apparel and home. That decline was in line with what analysts expected, according to StreetAccount.

Discretionary merchandise wasn’t the only part of the store under pressure. Sales in frequency categories, food and beverage and beauty and household essentials, declined by low-single digits, Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington said on a call with reporters.

Still, Hennington said Target is seeing some encouraging trends compared to recent quarters. Sales of apparel improved by nearly 4 percentage points from the fiscal fourth quarter, as customers bought outfits for spring.

She said Target’s limited-time collection with Diane Von Furstenberg drove millions of unique visits to the retailer’s website each day of the launch week and lifted the size of customers’ baskets by around 15% on average.

Other unique items also drove spending, she said. They included its partnership with tennis and lifestyle brand Prince to sell pickleball gear and Taylor Swift’s latest album, which Target capitalized on with in-store events and photo ops.

Shares of Target closed Tuesday at $155.78, bringing its market value to $72.07 billion. As of Tuesday’s close, shares of Target are up about 9% so far this year, lagging the S&P 500′s nearly 12% gains.

1ctidxy_AMD,AMD,performance targets for backtesting (CPU vs GPU),"Hello all, I have several different algos I’m currently running on a homegrown python framework that can run across several processors.

50% of the time I’m using a workstation w a AMD 32 core threadripper and 50% I do some AWS spot requests and get a 192 core machine.

Most of my strategies are using 5s OHLC bars.  On my theadripper I’ll get \~6000 bars/second per thread during backtesting and on the AWS machine that will be closer to \~7000 per thread.

When I do long (6month+) tests with tens of thousands of parameter permutations this can take awhile, even when running across 192 cores.

Most of the processing time is in pretty simple things I’ve already optimized (like rolling window calcs for min/max, standard deviations, and an occasional linear regression)

My actual question:

I’ve contemplated trying to move my system to the GPU thinking I’d be able to get a ton more parallelization.  The hard work is loading the data onto the GPU and then modifying all my code to use the subset of python that can be complied for the GPU (cython, CUDA, etc)

It’s a lot of work and I’m a 1 man team so I’m curious for those who have done it what actual perf gains you can achieve.  I imagine the per core metrics may actually go down, I’d just have access to thousands of cores in parallel.

The 192 core AWS machines are cheap to me.  With a spot request I can get an instance for \~$1.80/hour.

Is this worth it?

  
\*EDIT\* here is some recent perf captures that lead me to believe I am indeed CPU bound

1cmui9j_TGT,TGT,Update on my Target (TGT) position,"Less an a year ago I made a post about buying the dip on Target because I thought it was a severely beaten up all because of the economic environment and their political stance. 

Some bashed me for even bringing it up and others cautioned. I believe it was all fair criticism because it wasn’t too far from the truth. The only difference was that I believe that the truth at the time was only temporary. 

Present day, I was only able to accumulate ~23.46 shares of TGT at a cost basis of $125. My only disappointment is that I couldn’t accumulate more shares at the lower prices. I have not added to the position in a while now. I would be happy to add if the stock goes under a meaningful dip again. 

This is not to brag but just to emphasize that sometimes you have to take a swing at things that make sense to you. It could’ve easily went the other way but it was still worth taking a swing at despite the obvious risks.

1bvc05n_TSLA,TSLA,"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'","
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

1b77k5h_TGT,TGT,Target launches paid membership program as it chases new revenue streams,"Target on Tuesday said it will launch a paid membership program next month, riffing off the playbook of its rivals Amazon and Walmart.

The subscription tier, Target Circle 360, will include unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 in as little as one hour with no delivery fees and two free-day shipping, along with other perks. The retailer will continue to offer its free Target Circle loyalty program that offers special deals and sales throughout the year.

Target did not immediately say how much it would cost.

The big-box retailer is turning to the new revenue stream as it tries to boost weaker sales. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue reported Tuesday beat Wall Street’s expectations, but its comparable sales have declined three quarters in a row.

With the move, Target is also following in the footsteps of retailers that have turned membership fees into a money maker and a sales driver. Amazon launched its Prime program in 2005, with perks like free two-day delivery and streaming of popular movies and original TV shows. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month, with the video membership-only option of $8.99 per month.

Walmart launched its program, called Walmart+, in 2020. It costs $98 per year or $12.95 per month, with perks like free shipping, free grocery deliveries for orders of at least $35 and gas discounts.

Target is turning to its competitors’ playbook for a reason: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the company’s earnings call in February that Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much as non-members and buy more over the course of a year.

Walmart has not said how many people subscribe to Walmart+, but its CFO John David Rainey said on the earnings call that its membership continues to grow by double-digit percentages.

    Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) reports a 36% increase in adjusted EPS to $2.10, surpassing guidance.

    Operating income margin rate improves to 5.2%, with a 28.9% rise in operating income.

    Inventory levels reduced by 14%, with a significant 19% cut in discretionary categories.

    Company anticipates a mid-single digit decline in Q4 comparable sales, with EPS guidance set at $1.90 to $2.60.

    Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with TGT.

On November 15, 2023, Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) released its 8-K filing, revealing a third-quarter performance that showcased resilience in a challenging market. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed to $2.10, a 36% increase from the previous year, exceeding the high end of Target's guidance range. This growth was attributed to disciplined inventory and expense management, despite a 4.9% decline in comparable sales, which was anticipated.
Financial Highlights

Target's operating income margin rate saw an improvement, reaching 5.2%, which is 1.3 percentage points higher than the previous year. This was driven by a higher gross margin rate. The company's operating income rose by 28.9% to $1.3 billion, bolstered by lower markdowns, reduced freight costs, and a favorable category mix. However, sales dipped by 4.3% to $25.4 billion, with a slight decrease in other revenue.
Inventory and Capital Deployment

Inventory management was a key focus for Target this quarter, with overall inventory levels down by 14% year-over-year, and a notable 19% reduction in discretionary category inventory. The company did not repurchase any stock during the quarter but continued to pay dividends, totaling $507 million, reflecting a 1.9% increase in dividend per share.
Looking Forward

For the fourth quarter, Target is setting its sights on a mid-single digit decline in comparable sales and has provided an EPS guidance range of $1.90 to $2.60. The company remains committed to investing in its assortment, team, and services to ensure newness, affordability, and convenience for customers during the holiday season and beyond.
Operational Efficiency

Target's gross margin rate for the quarter was 27.4%, up from 24.7% in the previous year, reflecting a mix of lower costs and disciplined pricing strategies. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased slightly to 20.9% due to inflationary pressures and investments in pay and benefits, despite the company's cost management efforts.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

The company's balance sheet remains solid, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.9 billion. Target has generated over $5.3 billion in operating cash flow through the first three quarters of the year, a significant increase from approximately $550 million in the same period last year.

Target's financial performance in the third quarter demonstrates the company's ability to navigate a challenging retail environment effectively. The company's strategic focus on inventory management and cost control has paid off, leading to a strong profit performance despite softer sales. As Target prepares for the holiday season, it continues to prioritize value and convenience for its customers, which may help mitigate the impact of the expected decline in comparable sales in the fourth quarter.

* A bipartisan group of attorneys general is suing Meta over its addictive features aimed at kids and teens.
* The lawsuit represents the broad bipartisan interest in protecting kids and teens from online harm.
* Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege.

A bipartisan group of 33 attorneys general is suing Meta

over addictive features aimed at kids and teens, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in a federal court in California. The support from so many state AGs of different political backgrounds indicates a significant legal challenge to Meta’s business.

The lawsuit represents the latest legal challenge for the company and is another demonstration of the bipartisan priority that state law enforcers have placed on protecting kids and teens from online harm.

It’s also not the first time a broad coalition of state AGs have teamed up to go after Meta. In 2020, 48 states and territories sued the company on antitrust grounds, alongside a separate complaint from the Federal Trade Commission.

Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege. According to the federal complaint, Meta did this via the design of its algorithms, copious alerts, notifications and so-called infinite scroll through platform feeds. The company also includes features that the AGs allege negatively impact teens’ mental health through social comparison or promoting body dysmorphia, such as “likes” or photo filters.

The federal suit also accuses Meta of violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal data on users under 13 without parental consent.

The states are seeking an end to what they see as Meta’s harmful practices, as well as penalties and restitution.

Meta was well aware of the negative effects its design could have on its young users, the AGs allege.

Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen caused an uproar among lawmakers and parents in 2021 after leaking internal documents from the company that revealed internal research on its products. One set of documents about Instagram’s impact on teens found that “thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” The Wall Street Journal reported before Haugen made her identity known. Following the report, Instagram said it was working on ways to pull users away from dwelling on negative topics.

Several of the practices the AGs focus on for Meta are similar to those exercised by other social media businesses, such as designing algorithms to keep users engaged.

Among the states that filed the suit are California, Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin.",2023-10-24,613,128

Buying USA Cannabis stocks today is like getting in PRE-IPO after most stocks crashed -90% because the Federal Government hasn't done anything - **BUT THEY ARE NOW!**

**INVESTMENT THESIS = Biden will run on FULL Cannabis legalization in 2024** **🤫**

Joe Biden will run on **FULL FEDERAL CANNABIS RECREATIONAL** legalization if you vote for him in the Nov 2024 elections!!!! This will be announced shortly after he reclassifies Cannabis to from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 medical before the end of the year.

This is the Canada **Justin Trudeau ""PLAYBOOK""** where in 2015 Liberal Canadian party was in last place (3/3), then he promised Cannabis legalization and **FUCKING WON THE ELECTION!!!** 💣 💥

Why does Joe Biden need this as a win? Because he DESPERATLY needs the youth vote who he is failing on Student Loans and Inflation. Also the tax revenues will help pay down the USA national debt.

Because cannabis is still a schedule 1 narcotic, companies cannot be listed on the NYSE / NASDAQ and can only be bought OTC over the counter. As such, depending on your broker, you might only be able to buy $MSOS the USA Cannabis ETF.

There is also $MSOX which is the 2x ETF.

I get that their margins are shrinking, theft is a problem, political stance for LGBTQ support have hurt them but in the long term I don’t see Target going anywhere.

Some money manager talking head said that analysts revise their price targets because they don't want to look foolish or get laughed at when the current stock price passes their price target.

e.g. if there's a bubble and the stock shoots to $420.69, the analysts with their original price targets at $250 hurry up and increase their price targets to $420 so that they don't look foolish. Others might announce a ridiculous $600 price target (just to 1up other analysts and look cool maybe?)

And you notice what happens next? The price target is supposed to be a 12-month target. But moms/ pops bid up the stock right up to the 1 year target the **same or next day**! e.g. AVGO.

Given enough time, this cycle of squeeze>>price target increase>>squeeze could happen a few times.

Then what happens when the rug pull comes? mom/pop stuck holding the bag at a big loss.

&#x200B;

Even though the fundamentals say that $250 is a fair price, these weak analysts give in to peer pressure.  I wish these clowns would grow some balls and stick to their original analysis.

I also wish that the SEC would require analysts' track records to be published alongside their price target announcements, because a lot of these guys are full of shit.

The info is not easy to find, but if you do find it, you discover that some of these analysts turn your $100 into $40. Terrible track records. The average investor is too easily influenced by these clowns. It's detrimental.",2023-06-16,453,119

I won't explain my work specifically. It's rooted in linear regression and a one time framing which is a pit trading term. I doubt many here know what any of that is.

Basically one time framing is a liquidity driven phenomenon as old as 1870s so ... 150+ year track record. It's defined loosely as ever bar (frame) closes higher than previously, no more than two bars close same price or lower. When it closes same price or lower it half backs.

The linear regression confirms this half back as the daily linear regression is the bottom slanted green arrow. The price is in alignment with the 200day.

The confluences are too great to ignore.

Target could decide to do some public firings and apologize as it appears they have offended the majority but I doubt they will do that.

Today I am going to give a brief update and then show my thoughts for what is next. Communicated disclaimer - NFA

**Price Targets (3/5 hit)**

1. ~~$2.59~~
2. ~~$2.83~~
3. ~~$3.11~~
4. $3.67
5. $4.09

On my chart, below, you will see my bullish prediction of BCAN IF it can -

**a) sustain this volume**  
**b) keep this momentum**  
**c) flip the EMAs to bullish**

note\* the ""choppiness"" of my prediction path is not random, it is taking into account support and resistance levels of previous price action.

Remember - Volume always precedes price action, we could be in store for some more gains!

In conclusion, I am looking to see BCAN continue this momentum that it has. Let me know of your thoughts!

129y8ex_MS,MS,The big disconnect between CLNN's current market cap & new price targets issued the past several weeks after new Phase 2 trial result updates.,"
CLNN's current market cap is 85M, compared to companies with recently approved ALS treatment- like AMLX, which is over 2B.  Additionally, new price targets in the past couple weeks, range from $8- $15 (over 8x-10x current price).  One main disconnect may relate to most retail investors, naturally, not fully understanding how the FDAs framework for ALS drugs differs from normal. (And being aware the one the trials that its ALS drug was included in, did not meet  Phase 2 endpoints as prescribed in that study). 

However, three weeks ago, CLNN released results showing is drug preserved ALS patient functional score, and delayed time to clinical worsening, from the most recent 12-month data of the open-label extension of the Phase 2 RESCUE ALS trial in people with early ALS.

Phase 3 trials will not be required for its current ALS candidate. (although it will likely continue phase 3 studies for continued research and other related purposes). The purpose of phase 3 is to evaluate how the new medication works in comparison to existing medications for the same condition. 

CLNN's ALS candidate would fall under the category that is only really applicable up to phase 2. This lower criteria evaluates a response rate of a targeted drug in a patient population who has been poorly responsive to conventional therapy.

Additionally benefiting CLNN's ALS candidate... the ALS Act was signed into law in December 2021 to support additional advances.  Components of the bill include ""an FDA Action Plan to advance innovation that promotes and accelerates drug development for the treatment of rare neurodegenerative diseases including ALS.""

In September 2022 the FDA approved the ALS drug from AMLX (which was a combination of two existing products- a dietary supplement taurursodiol and a drug called sodium Phenyl butyrate), based on results from its smaller Phase 2 study (which it had initially rejected in March).  In the small clinical study, ALS patients appeared to progress more slowly and survive several months longer. In a memo summarizing its decision, the FDA said “regulatory flexibility” was appropriate for approving Relyvrio, “given the serious and life-threatening nature of ALS and the substantial unmet need.”

CLNN will meet with the FDA in an end of Phase 2 meeting, later this year to discuss the regulatory path forward for CNM-Au8 in ALS (& in MS).",2023-04-02,51,6

129ohms_TGT,TGT,BXP and TGT analysis,"Hey gang,

I'm posting my written reports on BXP and TGT. For context, I own both and together they make up around 60% of my portfolio. I originally wrote these reports a month or two ago because my dad was interested in my thoughts. He has investments in mutual funds but does not know much in terms of individual stock research, so that's why there is some overly simplified explanation of some things like credit ratings, FFO, etc. Also keep in mind some data may be slightly outdated since they are several weeks old at this point. I briefly went through and updated price info to Friday's close but the cap rate assumptions, for example, could be argued to be different now than two months ago.

Regardless, I'd love to hear thoughts from the group here, for better or for worse. So let me know what you guys think!

11zjhuq_SQ,SQ,Block (NYSE:SQ) target of a short report by Hindenburg Research,"https://hindenburgresearch.com/block/

Highlights:

>Our 2-year investigation has concluded that Block has systematically taken advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping. The “magic” behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.

>Our research indicates, however, that Block has wildly overstated its genuine user counts and has understated its customer acquisition costs. Former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.

>Core to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked” segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West” approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.

>In an apparent effort to preserve its growth engine, Cash App ignored internal employee concerns, along with warnings from the Secret Service, the U.S. Department of Labor OIG, FinCEN, and State Regulators which all specifically flagged the issue of multiple COVID relief payments going to the same account as an obvious sign of fraud.

>Congress passed a law that legally caps “interchange fees” charged by large banks that have over $10 billion in assets. Despite having $31 billion in assets, Block avoids these regulations by routing payments through a small bank and gouging merchants with elevated fees.

>Block includes only a single vague reference in its filings acknowledging it earns revenue from “interchange fees”. It has never revealed the full economics of this category, yet over one-third of Cash App’s revenue came from this opaque source, according to a 2022 Credit Suisse research report.

>Competitor PayPal has disclosed it is under investigation by both the SEC and the CFPB over its similar use of a small bank to avoid “interchange fee” caps. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request we filed with the SEC indicates that Block may be part of a similar investigation.

>In sum, we think Block has misled investors on key metrics, and embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst-practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.",2023-03-23,806,186

**Last Week – SPY exits tight February range to the downside.**

SPY fell about 2.7% last week, a larger move than options were pricing (1.5%). Treasury yields spiked as inflation worries renewed. The 2-year yield closed Friday at 4.81, its highest level since 2007. Implied vol continued its rise from the week before. The VIX got over 23 during the week before closing Friday just under 22. A little downside uncertainty returned as the SPX broke below the tight range it had been trading in February.

**This Week – Does the rise of IV continue?**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.6% move for the week. We are still in an environment where expected moves across the market are muted compared to the past year. But last week’s selloff was also the first time in about a month where the market moved to the downside significantly more than what options were pricing. And it came during a week of rising treasury yields, which had been rough moments for stocks in 2022. IV has crept up the past 2 weeks but the market was mostly seeing moves cancel each other out. If the market were to continue lower this week one would expect IV to continue to rise (as the VIX is still in the low 20’s.) The VIX has not been above 25 since December and at 22 is not that much higher than its historical mean. In 2022, VIX spikes toward 30 tended to coincide with market bounces and IV is nowhere near that level at the moment, indicating a wait-and-see approach on last week’s selling. Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 1.6% expected move, about $390 on the downside and $403 on the upside.

**Last Week – SPY exits tight February range to the downside.**

SPY fell about 2.7% last week, a larger move than options were pricing (1.5%). Treasury yields spiked as inflation worries renewed. The 2-year yield closed Friday at 4.81, its highest level since 2007. Implied vol continued its rise from the week before. The VIX got over 23 during the week before closing Friday just under 22. A little downside uncertainty returned as the SPX broke below the tight range it had been trading in February.

**This Week – Does the rise of IV continue?**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.6% move for the week. We are still in an environment where expected moves across the market are muted compared to the past year. But last week’s selloff was also the first time in about a month where the market moved to the downside significantly more than what options were pricing. And it came during a week of rising treasury yields, which had been rough moments for stocks in 2022. IV has crept up the past 2 weeks but the market was mostly seeing moves cancel each other out. If the market were to continue lower this week one would expect IV to continue to rise (as the VIX is still in the low 20’s.) The VIX has not been above 25 since December and at 22 is not that much higher than its historical mean. In 2022, VIX spikes toward 30 tended to coincide with market bounces and IV is nowhere near that level at the moment, indicating a wait-and-see approach on last week’s selling. Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 1.6% expected move, about $390 on the downside and $403 on the upside.

[Photo of Target ](https://preview.redd.it/z00fhcwrzgja1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5e4a0db5e1bf1b9de90cf8f82ac1e27d0bbbc18)

Walmart (WMT), and Home Depot (HD), are all set to report their earnings on Tuesday, February 21, 2023, before market open. *Target (TGT) Set to report on Feb 28, 2023*.  These companies are retail heavy weights, and a lot of people play their options. There could be great opportunities and good set ups in each of them. The purpose of this piece is to find, if any, the opportunities that exist in each of these companies. Let us have a look.

&#x200B;

**Earnings Play: What Are They?**

To preface, it is important to mention that earnings play are risky plays. You can loose all your money by things such as the popularly known IV Crush. And what does that mean? Towards earnings period, or any other volatile event for that matter, Implied volatility of options of the underlying stocks gets inflated, and this increases the value of the premiums of those options making them slightly expensive. It is almost safe to say that a lot of people have made this mistake: they buy calls or puts during earnings expecting to make bank, then after the earnings the stocks rises or falls to a relative degree only for them to see a worthless option or a loss of value of their options. Though the stock went in the direction of their expectation they, regardless, ended up losing money on that trade. That is IV crush.

&#x200B;

>**Investopedia:** *""Walmart, the largest retailer in the U.S. by revenue, is expected to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, which would mark a 6% decline and the third consecutive quarterly decline in EPS. Sales are projected to rise about 5% to just under $160 billion.""*  
>  
>**Seeking Alpha:** *""Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) are both due to report Q4 earnings on February 21, with analysts anticipating solid numbers for the holiday quarter and cautious guidance for the year ahead. While the retail sales report for January was stronger than anticipated, the conference call cadence from Walmart and Home Depot on current trends could impact the broad market. Notably, both stocks trail the S&P 500 Index for the early part of the year. ""*

&#x200B;

**Walmart (WMT) Q4 Earnings & Revenue For Period Ending Jan'23**

For the period ended Jan'23, the estimated revenue is $159.76B and the estimated earnings-per-share is $1.518. Some analysts are upbeat on this one. The reason being the strong holiday season, and same store sales which are projected to increase by 4.9% mostly due to its grocery business. Margins - cost of transportation is calming, but employee wages are rising; other operational costs are to be factored in. This could affect this earnings in one way or the other. One analyst went as far as to say, boldly, that they expect the stock to rally. The guidance may set the beat for the stock eventually.

&#x200B;

**Home Depot (HD) Q4 Earnings & Revenue For Period Ending Jan'23**

For the period ended Jan'23, the estimated revenue is $35.97B and the estimated earnings-per-share is $3.282. And how are the analyst sounding on this one? Not so upbeat. Neutral and even bearish. The reason being slow the housing market and a slight increase in same store sales by only 0.3% compared to about 8.1% same quarter last year.

**Target (TGT) Q4 Earnings & Revenue For Period Ending Jan'23**

For the period ended Jan'23, the estimated revenue is $30.652B and the estimated earnings-per-share is $1.398.  What are the analyst saying about this stock? One analyst went on CNBC and told the audience that TGT has climbed too fast. In his words ""It's gone too far, too fast"". You would think he would stop there, but he is not done, not yet, and he continues ""with the stock up above $170, they’ll need to make at least $9.0 maybe even pushing $10, which in a decelerating macro retail tape is a high ask. So, risk-reward for next week or two is favoring WMT.""

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* The Verdict \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

**Walmart - WMT**

The options chain are loaded though nothing eye catching to be honest. The Implied Volatility of WMT for Friday, Feb 24, expiry is 42.26%. It was 16.81% on Jan 13, a month ago, so the IV has more than doubled since that time. The premiums now, as you can imagine, is inflated.

[WMT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/wizp7rhx0hja1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed894386bc1a7d4f8e1f18ef7706142c65f10c13)

Lets take a look at the chart. What does it say? This stock has been on the run the past few day, and it is now in between the horizontal lines (labelled A & B) in the chart. It is also approaching a resistance, but we know earnings don't understand nor obey support and resistance. We can even see that in WMT chart at point C (in the chart) where the stock crashed so hard, thrashing support, and if you sold naked puts, you would have been put out of business here. The event leading to that crash was extraordinary, to be fair, and this sharply contrasts with the current bullish outlook for this earnings.

*So where is WMT headed for this earnings - up or down?*

The analyst are telling us that WMT is headed up - bullish, very bullish. But I wouldn't jump in yet on a moving car until it has stopped to let me in. Until that is the case. Of course, you can just sell a strangle or buy a straddle and you would still make money. After earnings -  I will wait to see what directions this one is headed.

**Home Depot - HD**

[HD Daily](https://preview.redd.it/k129pb781hja1.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a10a0d5b81e74c0c7e5d351f8f10917e66323e5)

The account on this one is that this earnings might be neutral or somewhat bearish, and that is according to the analysts. From the chart this stock is already bearish, but, again, earnings & revenue if better than expected the stock will run regardless. One analyst called this one a ""long-term hold"". From a risk to reward perspective, this one is the least of these three stocks. However, if ever it penetrates any of those boundary line, then, the bias would be towards whatever direction it is headed. But I wouldn't jump in yet until that is the case after earnings.

**Target - TGT**

[TGT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/mlqk5krc1hja1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=608f92829abf763efb39b390d6bd5dc2a301f585)

The analyst are bearish on this one, very bearish. The chart too looks bearish and approaching a critical point. In the last earning, the stock reached this point, but quickly fell apart. But, again, we know earnings don't obey resistance or support. Back in January 4th, one analyst gave this stock a price target of $142. Now, I don't exactly remember the full details behind that, but that certainly hasn't held this one back, as a matter of fact, the stock has rallied like a bird with multiple wings soaring through the open skies. A gap down on this one, due to earnings, would reinforce the bearish outlook and would imply more falling to come. If this stock, however, gaps up above that critical point, due to earnings, then you can almost forget all that bearish talk momentarily.

**Out of all these three stocks, opportunity abounds. Walmart and Target are especially the best set-ups. HD too.**

**A good trader is one who knows risk and is able to manage risk. You can still make money off of this just by selling the inflated IVs, although late now, but there is always a good opportunity. Don't FOMO, and don't chase. Goodluck, Not Financial Advice.**

wg44hd_COP,COP,$COPAF CopAur Minerals Defines New Drill Targets From Geophysical Survey At Kinsley Mountain Gold Project,"CopAur Minerals Inc.  (TSX-V: CPAU) (OTCQB:COPAF) is pleased to announce new drill targets generated from the recently completed induced polarization (IP) / resistivity geophysical surveying at the Company’s flagship Kinsley Mountain Gold Project (the “Kinsley Mountain Project” or “Kinsley Mountain”) in Elko County, Nevada. In total, 80 line-km of geophysical surveys have been completed at Kinsley, over a 9 km north-south strike length, covering an area of approximately 30 km2.

Interpretation of the survey data has identified a minimum of eight (8) untested high-priority targets at Kinsley North. The final phase of IP/resistivity surveying announced here specifically targeted the frontier Kinsley North Range, which contains a significant strike length of prospective, faulted Pogonip Group and upper Notch Peak Formation carbonate rocks that are known to host significant gold mineralization at the Long Canyon Mine1 located 90 km north of Kinsley. The observed chargeability and resistivity anomalies indicate potentially significant fault displacement coincident with mapped faults, arsenic ± antimony ± gold in soil anomalies, and prospective known gold hosting rock units.

Jeremy Yaseniuk, CEO, commented, *“The Kinsley IP survey has already generated eight new, high-quality drill targets in the underexplored Kinsley North area. The geophysical anomalies show a strong correlation with soil anomalies, faults, and alteration, similar to the known Kinsley gold resource zones, but are associated with the host rocks for gold mineralization at Long Canyon, which has produced over 1 million ounces of gold to date1,2. We believe that these new targets warrant drill testing.”*",2022-08-04,15,3

vds62x_V,V,LME.V - Laurion Mineral Exploration - Due Diligence & Buyout Target,"TLDR: Gold mining stock poised to provide 800-1200% ROI over the next 3 months.

Laurion Mineral Exploration (LME.V on the TSXV) is a junior brownstone polymetallic mining company focusing on proving up resources on its flagship Ishkoday Project with the end-goal of a full-cash buyout in the near term.  Assay results have shown a strong presence of Gold, Silver, Zinc and Copper mineralization throughout the property.  As a result of the mineralization being near the surface, LME was able to first channel sample the property to create a 2D GIS model, and over the last couple years has executed a very successful drill program to turn that 2D model into 3D.  Managements goal over the past few years has been to prove up resources amounting to 10 million Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEO's).  Although an NI43-101 has yet to be filled, I believe they've managed to hit that 10M GEO target and as a result of the expansion of the original mineralized area (called the McLeod Zone) the number of GEO's being considered for a buyout could instead be in the neighbourhood of 12-15M.

The company doesn't hold any debt and has been able to fund its drilling programs through successful private placements over the last number of years that have all been oversubscribed.  As it stands, assay results for 12 more drill holes are expected.  To meet regulatory requirements, LME needs to hold an AGM by September, which leads me to believe that big news could be coming in the next 3-6 weeks.  It was announced this week that the CEO has exercised options for 1,530,000 shares, many of which weren't expiring until the end of 2022, 2023, and 2024.  If that's not a bullish signal for you that something big is about to happen, then I don't know what is.  She's also never sold off any of her shares of LME, so I wouldn't be scared that she exercised her options, only to sell them at a good profit.  In fact, she's LME's largest shareholder, which is why I have the confidence she's got her shareholders best interests in mind seeing as she has so much personal capital invested and so much to gain herself.

With the stock mostly trading in a **$0.90 to $1.15** range for the past few months, where do we see it going from here?  Earlier in 2022, another Canadian Junior Miner (GBR) was bought out by Kinross Gold for what I believe was **$200/oz**.  Most of GBR's mineralization was at depth's of \~1800m, which makes it very difficult to access.  If GBR was able to fetch that price per GEO, then what can LME reasonably expect to see on an offer sheet when an open-pit mine is feasible as a result of the mineralization being at the surface!?! Conservatively, if for some reason, the market downturn, and managements requirement for an all-cash deal results in LME receiving a similar price per oz as GBR then at 10M GEO's, they'd be looking at a **$2 billion cash offer**.  With a little over **250 million shares** outstanding, this results in a buyout price of **$8.00/share,** which is an **800%** increase from current market prices.  If we ere on the side of optimism with something closer to **$300/oz.** and/or **12-15M** GEO's, then a buyout price of **$10.00-14.00/share** isn't unreasonable to expect.

From their latest PR, it's mentioned 81% of shares are held by ""friends and family"" insiders.  This means there's at most 48 million shares up for grabs by the street.  I doubt anyone within that insider category are willing to part with any of their shares if they have an inkling of an idea what the company's end goal is.  With the prospects of a 10X investment being ripe for the pickings to anyone with an investment account, I find it hard to believe the share price isn't currently above the $2.00-4.00 mark.  Clearly this company isn't being spoken about enough, and it's truly in the category of a hidden gem.  With inflation hitting such high levels, gold is going to be the safest place for investors and I think LME provides tremendous upside potential.

Let me know if you have any experience with other junior gold miners and potential buyout targets as well as what was a price you've seen get paid per GEO.

v6tqbl_TGT,TGT,Target shares fall as it expects squeezed profits from aggressive plan to get rid of unwanted inventory,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/target-markdowns-plan-to-cut-inventory.html

Target warned investors Tuesday that its profits will take a short-term hit, as it marks down unwanted items, cancels orders and takes aggressive steps to get rid of extra inventory. The retailer slashed its profit margin expectations for the fiscal second quarter to account for a wave of goods winding up deeply discounted or on the clearance rack. Shares fell more than 9% in premarket trading following the news. “We thought it was prudent for us to be decisive, act quickly, get out in front of this, address and optimize our inventory in the second quarter — take those actions necessary to remove the excess inventory and set ourselves up to continue to be guest relevant with our assortment,” CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with CNBC.

By taking swift action, Cornell said Target can fend off further pain and make room for merchandise that customers do want, such as groceries, beauty items, household essentials and seasonal categories like back-to-school supplies. He said the company’s stores and website are seeing strong traffic and “a very resilient customer,” but one who no longer shops popular Covid pandemic categories. “We want to make sure that we continue to lean into those categories that are relevant today,” he said. Target anticipates its operating margin rate for the second quarter will be around 2%. That’s lower than the outlook it gave less than three weeks ago, when it anticipated its operating margin rate would be roughly around its first-quarter operating margin rate of 5.3%.

In the back half of the year, Target anticipates profit margins will be in a range around 6% — better than its average performance for the fall season in the years before the pandemic began. The company said it still expects revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits for the full year and to maintain or gain market share in 2022. Retailers from Walmart to Gap face a glut of inventory as inflation-pinched shoppers skip over categories that were popular during the first two years of the pandemic. Gap, for instance, said customers want party dresses and office clothes instead of the many fleece hoodies and active clothes the company has. Walmart said some families are making fewer discretionary purchases as the prices of gas and groceries rise. Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters both reported a steep jump in inventory levels, up 46% and 45%, respectively, from a year ago from a mix of items not selling and supply chain delays easing. The extreme shift in consumers’ spending habits comes as retailers start to get back to healthy in-stock levels. That means some have an abundance of sweatpants, throw pillows and pajamas just as consumers search for swimsuits and suitcases. Plus, some shoppers are trimming back on spending due to inflation or putting more of their dollars toward experiences like dining out and traveling.

Cornell said Target decided to roll out its new inventory plan after hearing retail competitors had similar woes. He said the company also wanted to get ahead of key sales seasons, such as back-to-school and the holidays, when stale merchandise could clutter stores and drive away customers. Target said it had nearly $15.1 billion of inventory as of April 30, the end of the fiscal first quarter. That’s about 43% higher than in the year-ago period. Target shocked Wall Street on May 18 with a wide earnings miss for the fiscal first quarter, as it got hit by fuel and freight costs, higher levels of discounting, and a rotation away from items like TVs, small kitchen appliances and bicycles. Its shares fell nearly 25%, marking the company’s worst day on Wall Street in 35 years.

Walmart missed earnings expectations, too. Its inventory levels were up about 33% compared with a year ago. Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said at an investor event on Friday that about 20% of that is merchandise the retailer wishes it did not have. Roughly a third is additional inventory to help the retailer restock key items. He said it will be “a couple of quarters to get back to where we want to be.” That company’s shares also fell after Target’s announcement on Tuesday. Walmart’s shares were down about 4% in premarket trading. Cornell said Target is sorting through its inventory, deciding in some cases to pack away merchandise to sell at full price in the future and in other cases to promote or come up with ways to sell through it now. For instance, he said, Target had a big sales event over Memorial Day weekend to clear bulky outdoor items like patio furniture out of its backrooms. It also got additional space near U.S. ports to hold merchandise, so it has a place to move goods — some of which are arriving too early or too late.",2022-06-07,1033,259

us9wnx_TGT,TGT,"Target profit hit hard by high costs, inventory problems and markdowns","Target on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings that fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations, as the retailer coped with pricey freight costs, higher markdowns and lower-than-expected sales of discretionary items from TVs to bicycles.

Shares fell about 22% in premarket trading.

Here’s what Target reported for the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, compared with Refinitiv consensus estimates:

Earnings per share: $2.19 adjusted vs. $3.07 expected
Revenue: $25.17 billion vs. $24.49 billion expected

Sales did grow compared with that year-ago period. Comparable sales, a key metric that tracks sales at stores open at least 13 months and online, grew 3.3% in the first quarter. That is on top of a 23% increase in comparable sales in the year-ago quarter and it is higher than Wall Street’s projections for 0.8%

uq4nm1_TGT,TGT,Looking for a TGT breakout following earnings,"Target is reporting earnings next week and has a history of posting strong earnings and strong guidance. While taking an earnings hit on the chin last quarter, while still growing revenue, due in large part to refusal to pass on supply chain costs, I am expecting strong numbers next week. TGT also experienced a sell off earlier in the year and was not heavily impacted in the last few weeks. To me it looks like a bottom was found and I wouldn’t be surprised at all to see buying pressure following strong earnings as people look to rebalance portfolios away from highly valued growth stocks.

t318st_BP,BP,BP breakdown to achieve 2022 targets," I have a long position in BP so wanted to stress test their updated guidance following their announcement of divesting from Rosneft. Sharing here for feedback and in case it is of interest to others...

All data is FY 2021 and taken from their filings as well as their investor relations website. Guidance is taken from their press release 2/27/2022.

Cashflow from operations was $23.6BN, of that $2.7BN came from Rosneft so 2021 was $20.9BN excluding Rosneft.

Average realizations for the year were $63.60 (Liquids), $5.11 (Nat Gas) and $33.75 (Total Hydocarbon's BOE).

Guidance given:

Dividends to increase 4% for 2022, so going from $4.6BN to $4.78BN.

Capex expected to be $14BN to $15BN, lets use $15BN.

Divesting (excluding anything from Rosneft) $2BN to $3BN, lets use $2BN.

Surplus cash (after dividends and capex) to be shared 60% on buybacks and 40% on debt reduction.

Expect to be able to do $4BN in buybacks even at $60 per barrel.

\*\*\*my math\*\*\* if $4BN for backbacks at 60% surplus cash then would mean $2.7BN for debt reduction at 40%.

Total cashflow required for all of the above is $26.48BN, less the divesting gives $24.48BN.

So BP needs to expand is Cashflow from operations from $20.9NB (2021 excl Rosneft) to $24.48BN, which is a 17% increase. As I expect average realizations to be at least 30% up in 2022 and possibly way higher I am concluding that BP's 2022 target is more than achievable.

If above plays out then free cash flow yield would be >10% at current share price.

In addition, anything they can get from their divesture of Rosneft will be a cash benefit, whereas the market may (incorrectly in my opinion) get hung up on next earnings as Rosneft can no longer be considered equity so there is an $11BN hit for historical foreign exchange losses and different of Rosneft fair value as of March 31st and carrying value of $14BN.

s6f503_TGT,TGT,TGT Due Diligence,"**Target is an Online Big Box Juggernaut**

Target is a big box store that I am sure many of you visit and shop at frequently. Target in recent years has shifted to a hybrid approach to their business strategy where they not only sell items in person but online. Target is currently down 17% from their all time highs that they had in November of 2021. Target is currently sitting at an attractive 16.71 PE ratio while the average PE ratio for the SP 500 is 26.59. Looking at earnings you would think that TGT is undervalued but let's dive deeper since PE ratios don’t tell the whole story of a company and can be deceiving. TGT has beat quarterly earnings for the past 10 quarters which suggests that analysts remain bearish on the company.

**Let's go shopping**

Since Target launched their same day delivery services in 2017 their EPS has grown from 5.01 to 10.26 current day. Target has also found ways to interact with their shoppers when they introduced Target Red in 2018. Target Red allows shoppers to earn 5% off their Target purchases but the interest rates are 23% on their cards and allows Target to collect data on their shoppers. To be clear TD Bank of USA manages the credit cards and Targets main benefit is the data collection of their customers.

**FUNdamentals**

Debt:**10.64 B**

Free Cash Flow:**7.88 B**

Div Yield (FWD): **1.63%**

Annual Payout (FWD): **$3.60**

Payout Ratio: **27.17%**

5 Year Growth Rate: **6.38%**

Dividend Growth: **53 Years**

Target has a low payout ratio at 27% which gives plenty of room for the company to continue to increase their dividends. With the average yield for the past 4 years being 2.54%.Their last dividend increase was in 2021 when the dividend was increased by an insane 32%. I personally am a dividend growth investor. The growth of Targets dividend has been impressive and wildly slept on by many investors. There is plenty of security with their status as a dividend king (50+ years of dividend payments.) The dividend growth rate gives young investors with long investment horizons an attractive compounding interest, even with the yield sitting at a low 1.63% your yield on cost will grow exponentially if you hold this company for 10-20 years.

Here is a retrospective look from Jan 2007 before the housing market crash when the market was on a strong bull run. I picked this time period because it’s not a cherry picked low for the company but a high that took over 5 years to make any gains on your investment.  A $1,000 investment would have increased to a whopping $4,142 in gains ($5,142 in total) at the time TGT was paying $.14 quarterly in dividends $.56 yearly  to now $.90 quarterly $3.60 annually an increase of 642% over a 15 year period averaging a 42% per year dividend increase over the past 15 years.

**Risks**

Back in 2020 when the pandemic first started TGT saw their earnings go to almost 0 where the economy was paused but they have quickly recovered and have little to no current risks. One could possibly argue debt to cash flow is a bit high but they can easily pay it down. They are a growing company so it is to be expected that they leverage their capital to continue to expand. With Covid-19 being a non factor to Targets business there are few threats to this company.

**Plop your money here and forget it**

My investment thesis of target is it is currently at a discount, if the company was valued at market average it would be priced at $351.11 a 26.5 PE average. With the market being so expensive currently Target offers great value for a consistent/growing company with strong fundamentals. Target should easily be priced around
$300-351. I think Target is one of the highest quality companies in the world with many of its shoppers highly dedicated to shopping there. They continue to beat expectations and return growing dividends to their investors sets investors with a company to buy and hold for decades to come. TGT has continued their share buybacks which further increases the capital appreciation to their investors. Combining the dividend growth and share buy backs this company is a long term play. Target has the honey to attract the bees it’s only a matter of time for investors to come to their senses about this company.

**GLOBAL THC + CBD + ACCESSORIES STRATEGY**

CannaCabana.com #1 in Canada for THC, CBD, & Accessories w/ 105 stores

BlessedCBD #1 in UK, just announced delivery to Germany, USA, Italy, & France. European takeover imminent.

NuLeaf (just acquired!) & FabCBD are both top CBD brands in the USA. 70%+ margins on these CBD businesses.

Meanwhile, GrassCity.com, SmokeCartel.com, DailyHighClub.com, & DankStop.com are most of the top accessory websites in the world getting 100M visits in 2020, so the 2021 # should be big. $HITI has ~3M High Lifetime Value customers (who bought pipes, bongs, vapes, dab rigs, etc) in a list segmented by US state, so they could do a partnership with a (NY for example) MSO to add a ""Buy Weed"" button in any state.

**2021 Recap**

https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-recaps-milestones-of-2021/

- Nasdaq uplist. 4 new analysts
- Opened 48 stores. Total now 105. 150 by EOY '22
- Accretive M&A of 3 Accessory biz & 3 CBD biz
- Club membership is booming w/ new discount model
- Q4 & Q1 ER will update projections
- 2 new initiatives coming

-----

**OVERVIEW**

**1) FINANCIALS**.  

A) Q3 ER $48M revenue BEAT expectations.   

B) ~240M (USD) market cap when the price is $4.25/share (USD).  

C) Q4 ER will be around late January -- 90 days after Q4 ended on 10/31/21. 

D) After Q4 & Q1 ER, the projected revenue should be updated to ~250-300M (USD) in 2022 with a reach goal of $420M (USD) with more M&A and possible USA partnerships. 

E) Rapid expansion of stores (~105 EOY '21; ~150 EOY '22; 200 EOY '23) and M&A now = Big Net Profits later

**2) NON-DILUTIVE FINANCING (NDF)** = $25M secured. Ability to negotiate more NDF grows as the consensus EBITDA projections grow

**3) ANALYSTS** (5 of 6!) w/ BUY RATINGS. 
ATB, Echelon were the first two analysts to issue BUY ratings. They were joined by ROTH & Desjardins a few months ago. Beacon Securities recently initiated coverage and on 11/22 Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage with a HOLD rating preferring the underperforming/underwhelming (soon to be 40% Couche-Tard owned) F&F instead (oops!). It's not just about the ""BUY"" ratings and the PTs -- these analysts host ""roadshows"" (giving them access to Raj, the team, and the facilities) and distribute their in-depth reports to all their institutional clients. 

**4) M&A** targets are always in a loaded deal pipeline. Negotiated several accretive deals on CBD & Accessory businesses to round out their diverse THC, CBD, & Accessory cannabis biz ecosystem:

**ACCESSORIES**
1) www.GrassCity.com. 
2) www.SmokeCartel.com. 
3) www.DailyHighClub.com. 
4) www.DankStop.com

**CBD**
1) www.FabCBD.com. 
2) www.BlessedCBD.co.uk. 
3) www.NuLeafNaturals.com (acquired 11/22)  

**5) ETFs** (6) hold & add. MJ ETF has accumulated 3.5M+ shares in a few months, so they own 6% of the float.

**6) INSTITUTIONS** went from 0 to ~30 institutions in just a few quarters. Institutional ownership went up 420% from Q2 to Q3 with way more Calls than Puts. New institutions quietly buying in Q4 will be revealed mid-Feb. Full Analysis: https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/407651499 (Institutional Ownership %) & https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/407648466 (Calls/Puts)


**7) VALUATION**. Undervalued. ~1.5x P/S compared to other retailers like Dollarama at 5 P/S+ and LPs at 10+ P/S. NASDAQ-listed Canadian LPs are unprofitable cash-burning machines, powered by dilution & delusion. MSOS can't as much institutional love stuck on the OTC.



-----

**RAJ IS A SELF-MADE (BEAST) CEO**

Raj is the biggest shareholder (~6.5M!) and has never sold a share.

He started this company with $40k and one store and grew it into the empire you see today. And he isn't slowing down. 

He wasn't handed millions which he squandered paying themselves and their friends first or expanding too much too fast. 

He is shrewd. Smart. Strategic. Charismatic. Transparent. And he does whatever he says he is going to do, when he says he is going to do it. 

That's rare.

You bet on visionary leaders like that.

That's why there are 4-5x as many watchers on StockTwits than any USA MSO. 

The passion we feel is contagious. It's only a matter of time before more institutions and retail investors realize what we already did and trust Raj to take us to the promised land.


-----

**NULEAF NATURALS ACQUISITION SIGNIFICANCE**

https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-continues-expansion-into-global-cbd-market-with-acquisition-of-colorado-based-nuleaf-naturals/

Located in Denver CO, NuLeaf Naturals is one of the top CBD brands in the USA in terms of CBD-blend research & IP, rapid growth, and industry-leading margins. $16M of the ~$20M revenue is direct-to-consumer, but the expanding agreement with Sprouts will allow for wider B&M retail distribution.

It's notable that their facility is cGMP certified. It can generate up to 60,000 vegan soft-gels per hour, which is 25% of their business. Production of FabCBD and BlessedCBD will be moved to the facility for cost savings.

Once USA legalization allows, High Tide hinted that this facility could also create THC infused edibles and drinks.


-----



**DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL STRATEGY**

https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-becomes-north-americas-first-cannabis-discount-club-retailer-with-over-245000-members/ (now 360K members as of the 1/6 PR with an estimated 70-90K+ members going to be added every quarter)

DATA DRIVEN decision based on successful pilot programs 

Membership in this loyalty program is FREE ...for now. Every person who walks into a Canna Cabana sees a high cost for non-members, and a discounted cost for members. When they realize signing up for FREE with their email address and phone # (SMS) makes them a MEMBER of the CABANA CLUB, they will do so in order to save money on that purchase and future purchases.

Stores are stocked w/ HIGH MARGIN products like consumption accessories, FabCBD & Blessed CBD, (soon) house brands of shatter & gummies -- with other form factors later.

Anecdotal reports/reviews of lines out the door are a sign this strategy is working.

**This is a DATA and MARKET SHARE grab from other retailers and the black market by running them out of business.**




-----


**NON-DILUTIVE FINANCING VIRTUOUS CYCLE**

https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-secures-non-dilutive-credit-facility-with-atb-financial/

25M non dilutive bank financing secured

~20M in cash on hand

(40M ATM offering can be used at higher prices, which gives them flexibility if there is a bigger deal too good to pass up.)

That is a nice war chest to begin to ramp up from 100 to 200 stores AND do some more M&A

Projected revenue then goes up

Analysts' PTs forced to go up based on updated models

Which allows High Tide to secure more NDF based on consensus EBITDA run rate

Repeat virtuous cycle until 200 stores

Repeat virtuous cycle until World Domination



-----

**FASTENDR (acquired 1/5/21) HOT TAKE**

https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-to-acquire-fastendr-retail-kiosk-and-smart-locker-technology-through-acquisition-of-bud-room-inc/

Watch Video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oTvTrTSnn4

Discount model is causing long lines out the door. Taking a page from leading retailers in other sectors, this allows customers to order online or at a kiosk, and pick up from a ""smart"" locker. For those customers who know what they want and don't need the budtender's guidance, this is a slick convenience. Very few dispensaries in the world have this experience.

Also mentioned in the PR is the desire to license this tech to other dispensaries and industries which could turn into yet another revenue stream.

Delivery will be made available in as many location as allowed by law, but this offers a fast, convenient, slick way of ordering / picking up. It also cuts down on $$$ spent on budtenders while keeping lines moving. 

*With plans to expand in Europe, I could envision a smaller ""Bud Room"" store concept that almost feels like a vending machine. While not discussed in the press release, the stigma of cannabis still exists worldwide, so some might be turned off by the idea of being seen in line waiting at a dispensary. Side benefit worth mentioning.*

**Overall, while this will increase profitability, this changes the perception of the company stock to THC + CBD + Accessories + *Data&Tech* -- which should help command higher multiples.**


-----


**CATALYSTS** Barnacles like to see develop

**A) NON-DILUTIVE FINANCING**. Allows rapid expansion without just issuing shares. 

**B) NEW DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL + PRIVATE LABEL LAUNCH**. 2.0 products (launching soon!) & CBD will mega-boost margins.

**C) FUNDAMENTALS** improving through rapid store opening&maturation and M&A aligned w/ eCommerce domination STRATEGY. ~3M high lifetime value customer emails + data + social across USA = most valuable asset

**D) LEGALIZATION** ""working-on-it"" headlines sparking another forward-looking cannabis sector bull run. Most institutions can't invest in USA MSOs stuck on the OTC (likely several more mo), so they invest in NASDAQ companies w/ higher valuations. And we all know HITI's superior fundamentals, valuation, & profit projections stack up very well vs LPs & comps

**E) MORE ANALYSTS & INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS** 

**F) NARRATIVE shift from LP to RETAIL.** See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSdyhx11iJM

**BEAR CASE**

Check out AlexM's video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkthZBd59TY. 
He does an amazing job covering major High Tide events and his bear case video is no exception.

My hot take on saturation / competition concerns...

People worried about ""saturation"" don't get that big boys like High Tide are the ones that will benefit in the long run. Mom & Pops will get run out of business due to margin pressure. Meanwhile High Tide uses their position to negotiate better prices, which only serves to accelerate this process. Then High Tide gets to buy the best locations based on data while letting the underperformers close their doors.

Coffee shops close. Starbucks gets bigger/stronger.

Department stores close. Target gets bigger/stronger.

Taking pages from the playbooks of Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Grocery Stores is how you win this Retail game.

**High Tide is engaging in a price war it knows it can win.**


-----

**GROWTH > STAGNATION**

The entire cannabis sector is in rapid growth mode. Top operators do all they can to expand their geographic footprint. They use cash, loans, and shares to buy & build assets that allow them to sell cannabis in as many locations as possible. 

(High Tide's strategy is unique because they have been more focused on expanding their DIGITAL footprint, but I've covered the brilliance of that strategy in other posts.)

The reason they are all expanding this quickly is because they are confident the demand will continue we to rise and those assets will be worth far more in the future. Frankly, if they don't expand into X state, their competition will.

What if High Tide never bought META or any of these profitable eCommerce CBD & Accessory biz. High Tide would be net profitable with 30ish  locations, and Raj could still own 51% of the shares. 

No ""dilution"" (yay!?), BUT...

No Growth. No World Domination. No Nasdaq. No institutions. No '20-'21 stock price boom.

GROWTH is better than Stagnation

**COMMANDING ECOMM RETAILER MULTIPLES**

High margin private label THC (edibles, shatter -- later flower, vape, etc) & FabCBD.com / BlessedCBD / NuLeaf a big reason High Tide is projected to be net profitable in 2022. 

When High Tide...  
A) Sells the most Accessories & CBD worldwide.

B) Owns multiple businesses in the USA.  

C) Sells cannabis data.  

D) Produces/creates THC edible, vape, & flower brands. 
 
E) Provides accessories to dispensaries across multiple states.  

F) PARTNERS WITH STATE OPERATORS TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO SELL THC TO THEIR ~3M+ HIGH LIFETIME VALUE CANNABIS CONSUMERS(!!)

...is it still considered ""just a Canadian Cannabis Retailer"" ???

It's all about flippening the LP vs Retail narrative and COMMANDING NASDAQ-listed NET PROFITABLE GLOBAL / MULTI-STATE USA ECOMM RETAILER TECH MULTIPLES

Diverse income streams and a nimble plan makes HITI DANGEROUS in any scenario



-----


**WORLD DOMINATION or BIG TIME BUY OUT**

I play a lot of chess so I apologize for the chess analogy 

High Tide is a ""passed p@wn"" -- www.chess.com/terms/passed-pawn

Meaning, they have advanced the p@wn aggressively down the board and are heading for the opponent's back rank. If they get there, they become a Queen, the most powerful piece on the board.

Because High Tide is acquiring all these eCommerce driven consumption accessory businesses at low multiples, they have a golden list of ~3M high lifetime value customers (who bought pipes, bongs, vapes, dab rigs, etc) segmented by US State. Any MSO or LP (or large company outside the sector!) with USA domination plans wants this list.

**3M customers X $100 profit on average per customer = $300MM which is more than the current market cap. How much is this (growing) list on its own worth? $300MM? $600MM? 1.2B?**

If an MSO or LP doesn't buy them out, they will keep pushing that p@wn, and then they will have to compete against them when they become a Queen.

**Passed p@wns are how you win the (Cannabis) End Game**

High Tide is a ""passed p@wn"" -- www.chess.com/terms/passed-pawn

Meaning, they have advanced the p@wn aggressively down the board and are heading for the opponent's back rank. If they get there, they become a Queen, the most powerful piece on the board.

Because High Tide is acquiring all these eCommerce driven consumption accessory businesses at low multiples, they have a golden list of ~3M high lifetime value customers (who bought pipes, bongs, vapes, dab rigs, etc) segmented by US State. Any MSO or LP (or large company outside the sector!) with USA domination plans wants this list.

**3M customers X $100 profit on average per customer = $300MM which is more than the current market cap. How much is this (growing) list on its own worth? $300MM? $600MM? 1.2B?**

If an MSO or LP doesn't buy them out, they will keep pushing that p@wn, and then they will have to compete against them when they become a Queen.

**Passed p@wns are how you win the (Cannabis) End Game**

Going back to 1985 TGT has outperformed COST, but recently 2011 to 2021 COST has outperformed TGT.

TGT looks like a much better value now compared to COST.

So I'm leaning towards a 50/50 split. Maybe 2.5% portfolio each for about 5% of my portfolio.

Are other retail worth considering?   WMT looks terrible as of late and hasn't really done well in comparison to COST and TGT I think. I realize WMT is one of the most powerful companies though, but I'm looking for return of course as we all are!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don’t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn’t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It’s literally all just gambling, and as a result I’m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I’ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.

&nbsp;

- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we’re going up.

&nbsp;

- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you’re poor or want a binary directional play, I’d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we’re probably gonna do the classic “dump after earnings regardless of the outcome“ thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.

&nbsp;

All that being said, there aren’t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I’ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

o If done successfully, this can help Lululemon launch their business to the next level, and drastically improve on their financial reports.

· Furthermore, Lululemon’s desire to grow is also exhibited through their acquisition of MIRROR, which they believe is an extension of their brands principals/image.

o If Lululemon can make changes to this business and scale it, there is another fantastic opportunity for future growth there.

· However, the valuation techniques used in this report argue that Lululemon’s Stock - $LULU, is currently overvalued. My models predict that $LULU price target is $362/share (implying a 9.4% drop).

o There are risks and catalysts that could potentially have large impacts on the share price, and my opinions on them as a company. These risks/catalysts are listed at the end of this report.

**Company Overview:**

[$LULU – Lululemon Athletica Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/LULU) designs and distributes their athletic apparel, and accessories to their customers worldwide. Lululemon’s goal is to continue to grow their cult-like following around the principals of exercise and health.

Lululemon is actively chasing this goal, which Is evident through their recent purchase of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform with live & pre-recorded classes.

Recently, Lululemon has set their eyes on further expansion into China, Europe, and Asia, which could be very lucrative if done correctly, as these countries/continents have large markets.

**Investment Information:**

*Business Segments:*

Lululemon has split their business into 2 main segments in their sec filings for reporting purposes. These two segments include their Company-Operated Stores, and their Direct-to-Consumer segment (DTC).

In 2020, their DTC segment represented 52% of their total revenues. This increased drastically from 2019, as in 2019 only 29% of Lululemon’s revenue came from their DTC sales channel. This increase is good to see as an investor as the DTC sales model tends to have better margins, which can help Lululemon’s profitability and help them report better financials.

In 2020, Lululemon’s Company-Operated segment represented 38% of their total revenues. This is a large decrease from their 2019 figure of 63%. Once again this is good to see as DTC tends to be favourable for companies.

This drastic shift away from Company-Operated stores, and to their DTC sales channel can be attributed to COVID-19. Many companies (including Lululemon) were forced to close their stores at the start of the pandemic, these companies were forced to either adapt or be left behind. Luckily for Lululemon, they already had an established DTC model, which helped them to adapt quickly and capture the online market very quickly. As a result of this, Lululemon was able to generate record revenues and increase their margins.

The rest of the revenues not accounted for belong to their “other” segment. This “other” segment includes their revenues from MIRROR, outlet stores, and pop-up stores.

*Company-Operated Stores:*

Despite the pandemic still raging on Lululemon was able to net an increase of 30 stores in 2020. Out of these 30 stores, 10 came from the USA, 17 came from China, 2 came from the UK, 2 came from South Korea, and 1 came from Germany.

If you did the math, you will have noticed that I just listed off 32 new stores, this is because I have not factored in the 2 stores that were closed down over the past year, 1 store in Canada closed, and 1 store in Japan closed.

As we can see from their Company-Operated Stores data, Lululemon is currently expanding into Europe and China. It is likely that we see this expansion continue in China and Europe, as well as a focus on starting to expand into Asia.

*Seasonality:*

Lululemon has acknowledged that their revenues are very seasonal, and that they tend to generate the most revenue in the fourth quarter. This is very common among multiple industries (especially retail) as it is the holiday season. However, Lululemon’s business is much more seasonal than most. This can be observed through their revenues in 2019 and 2020, in which $LULU earnings reported that 47% and 56% of their revenues in these respective years came in the fourth quarter alone.

This is important to know as an investor and is noteworthy especially as we approach $LULU stock earnings for Q4 (likely to be on January 31st, 2022). This jump in revenues is already somewhat priced in, however if we assume that 56% of their revenues comes in Q4 this year than we ca make our own estimate.

Using this 56% figure, we can estimate Lululemon’s Q4 EPS to be $2.74 \[(sum of Q1-Q3)/ (0.44)\] – (Sum of Q1-Q3). This implies that Lululemon will beat their earnings report in Q4 by 10.93% (Q4 EPS estimated to be $2.47 by taking the average of 8 analyst estimates) which may serve to be a catalyst in the future.

*MIRROR Acquisition:*

On July 7th, 2020, Lululemon purchased all of the outstanding shares of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with both live and on-demand classes. It has been reported that this purchase was $500M. Of this $500M, Lululemon has reported that $360M of it is “goodwill”.

For those of you that do not know, “goodwill” is the difference between the purchase price of a business, and that businesses fair value of assets \[= (assets acquired) – (liabilities assumed)\]. In this case, Lululemon paid $350M over the “fair value” of MIRROR, this goodwill is valuable due to the reputation and the brand that the purchased company built.

In their SEC 10-K filing, Lululemon stated that they purchased MIRROR based off of growth, discount, and royalty rates that they believe the can make in the future. This is important as Lululemon believes that they can generate revenues and profits in the future.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Lululemon was able to increase their revenues by 11%, increase their gross profit by 11%, increase their gross margin by 0.1 percentage point, and increase their DTC revenues by 101%.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Lululemon increased their cost of revenue by 10% (which is good because the increase in cost of revenue is less than the increase in revenues), their income from operations decreased by 8% (decreased operating margin), their revenues from company-operated stores fell by 34%, and their net income fell by 9%.

· **Overall Financial Performance:** It is rather difficult to give an opinion on whether Lululemon’s financial performance was good or bad in 2020. This is because there were economic factors (ie. COVID-19) that had adverse effects on businesses, which made some companies report “bad” earnings. However, the pandemic also helped many companies transform to digital, or helped companies (ie. Zoom) to have quicker adoption and report very good earnings. This dilemma is very prevalent with Lululemon as many retail and mall stores did horribly through COVID (Lululemon was no exception), however companies that adopted a social media presence and a DTC model were able to perform rather well (ie. Lululemon). Overall, I think that Lululemon had a slightly worse financial performance (as opposed to better). I think this because their DTC model should have helped them to achieve better margins and be more profitable, however the opposite happened and Lululemon’s net income fell.

· **Options Exercised:** In 2020, Lululemon issued 182,000 shares through the exercise of stock options. This issuance had a dilutionary effect of around 0.1%

· **Performance Stock units (PSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon offered 171,000 shares through the vesting of performance-based stock units (PRU’s). These shares are given out to employees based on their performances and goals that they met. The issuance of these shares had a dilutionary effect on Lululemon’s existing common shares of approximately 0.1%

· **Restricted Stock (and shares) Units (RSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon issued a total of 196,000 common shares as a result of the vesting of their Restricted Stock Units. This issuance had a dilutionary effect on existing shares of approximately 0.2%

· **Share Repurchases:** in 2020, Lululemon reported that they repurchased a total of 400,000 shares in 2020 alone. This repurchase offset the majority of Lululemon’s dilution for the year 2020, netting a total of 149,000 shares issued during the year. This brings the total dilution for 2020 down to 0.1%, which is essentially negligible. The fact that Lululemon has little to no share dilution even after acquiring MIRROR is a very good sign for investors and potential investors alike.

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analyses, I needed to find 4 companies that are comparable/similar to Lululemon.

These companies need to exhibit the following characteristics to be considered: be publicly listed, have valid financial ratios/multiples, have similar operations to Lululemon, and be of similar market cap.

By narrowing down the companies based off of the above criteria, I ended up with the following 4 comparable companies:

· [**$GOOS Stock – Canada Goose Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/GOOS) Canada Goose designs, manufactures, and sells their performance and luxury apparel for men and women. Canada Goose sells their products primarily in Canada but also in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Internationally. Canada Goose also sells their apparel in both physical retail stores as well as through their online store (DTC model).

· [**$LEVI Stock – Levi Strauss & Co**](https://utradea.com/stocks/LEVI)**:** Levi Strauss designs, markets, and sells their jeans, shirts, other forms of apparel, and accessories in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Levi’s sells through 3rd party retailers, 3rd party e-Commerce stores, company-operated stores, and their company website (DTC).

· [**$UA Stock – Under Armour Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UA) Under Armour develops, markets, and distributes their apparel, footwear, and accessories to their customers in North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Latin America. Under Armour sells their products through wholesale channels, distributors, and through their DTC channel (e-Commerce store).

· [**$AEO – American Eagle Outfitters Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/AEO) American Eagle is a specialty retailer that provides clothing and accessories to their customers in USA, Canada, Mexico, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, American Eagle is able to ship to 81 countries around the world through their online store (DTC).

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to calculate the WACC through my own models. These models can be found in the DCF model. My WACC model estimated that Lululemon’s WACC is approximately 7.75%, which I used in my DCF model.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I used a CAGR that was between Lululemon’s gross profit growth rate over the past 5 years, and the average forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years. By doing this I arrived at a CAGR of 19.26% over the next 5 years.

*CAGR (2029+):*

I estimated lululemon’s CAGR for 2029 and 2030 to be 10 as it seems like a reasonable number given Lululemon’s growth. In the years between 2025 and 2029, I slowly tapered down the growth rate from 19.26% to 10%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2021-2025):*

In order to achieve this figure, I used the same approach as the CAGR. By doing this I arrived t an Operating Expense Increase Rate of 19%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2029+):*

To predict Lululemon’s operating expense growth rate for 2029 and beyond, I decided to use 9%. I did this because the operating expense increase rate has always been relatively close to their CAGR.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

Over the past couple of years, Lululemon’s average yearly Depreciation and Amortization growth is 15.47%. I used this historic growth rate to forecast the future growth in my DCF model.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s tax rate to be 28.10% through their SEC 10-K filings.

*Capital Expenditure Growth Rate:*

Over the past couple of years Lululemon’s CAPEX has grown at an average of 2.2% per year. I used this historic rate to forecast their future growth rate.

*Risk Free Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s risk free rate through a website called Finbox. Finbox estimated that Lululemon’s risk free rate was 2.25%.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

In order to arrive at a $LULU stock price target, I decided to undergo a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. In order to compete my DCF model, I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By doing this, I found Lululemon’s fair value to be $459/share, which implies an upside of 15%. This is quite reasonable; however, it may be a little high and as a result of this I decided to undergo 3 comparable analyses to gather more information.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*EV/EBITDA:*

Through comparing Lululemon’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors (listed above in the “competitors” section of this report), I found that $LULU stock price target should be $311/share. If this were the case, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 22%. This is vastly different from the results achieved through the DCF model, so I underwent another comparable.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Lululemon’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, I found that Lululemon should have a fair value around $160/share. If this were to come to fruition, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 60%. This is vastly different from the DCF valuation and is even very different from the previous comparable. As a result of this inconsistency, I decided to undergo one final comparable.

*P/E:*

By comparing Lululemon’s P/E ratio to their public competitors, I found them to have a fair value of $324/share, which would imply a downside risk of 19%. This result is somewhat consistent of that achieved through the EV/EBITDA comparable, however as a result of the general inconsistency among comparable analyses, I decided to take the average result from each of them.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result of the 3 comparable analyses, I arrived at one, all-encompassing comparable valuation of $265/share, which implies a downside risk of 34%

**Plan:**

Due to the inconsistency between the comparable valuation and the DCF valuation, I decided to take the average result in order to draw one price target for Lululemon. By doing this I arrived at an overall $LULU price target of $362/share, which implies a downside risk of 9.4%.

My plan would be to wait for Lululemon to drop 9.4% (or to the $362 price target) before buying in.

I prefer this plan over shorting $LULU because I believe in the long-term prospect of Lululemon, and Lululemon has big reactions to news and is very volatile in the shorter time frames.

**Catalysts:**

· **International Expansion:** We know that Lululemon is looking to expand further in China, Europe, and Asia. These markets are huge and can be very lucrative for Lululemon if they are able to capture this market. If Lululemon does this successfully, their future financial reports should reflect a large increase in revenues due to this expansion, which should excite investors.

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon had a subpar financial performance. However, if they are able to fic this and report good earnings for the year 2021, they will get investors excited about the future growth prospect of Lululemon, which should help their price.

· **Q4 Earnings:** Based off of their seasonality I have estimated that Lululemon will beat their expected Q4 earnings. Obviously, I very well could be wrong here, however, if I am right their stock price should be benefitted by beating their earnings estimates.

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon did not have the best financial performance. Although there were some good aspects of it, I felt that the bad outweighed the good and resulted in an overall poor financial performance in 2020. If Lululemon continues on this path of poor financial performances in 2021 then investors may lose faith in Lululemon’s ability to continue their growth, and consequently exit their positions.

· **Seasonality:** As we know, Lululemon has historically experienced seasonality especially in their Q4 financial reports. This kind of seasonality has already been priced in, to a certain extent, however if the seasonality starts to fade and Starbucks misses estimates, their stock could be negatively affected.

**An Investment Analysis Looking at Why You Should Consider Buying Target Stock:**

· According to the valuation techniques that I used throughout this analysis, I have reason to believe that Target is undervalued and could be a good stock to buy. I arrived at a final price target of $275/share, which implies an upside of 9.5%.

o Although this looks like a good investment on the surface, there are potential future risks and catalysts that can influence the price of their stock. These events are discussed at the end of this analysis.

· The effects of the pandemic were felt differently by different businesses over the course of the last year and a bit. While most companies suffered due to the pandemic, there were also some companies that benefitted massively from the pandemic.

o Retail stores are one example of an industry that profited massively off of the pandemic, as they were sometimes the only stores that were allowed to remain open.

· Target is one company that did particularly well during the pandemic, however, with the pandemic seemingly starting to come to its conclusion, how will Target fare in the post-pandemic US economy?

**Company Overview:**

Target offers food, apparel, accessories, home décor, electronic, seasonal, beauty, and household products to their customers in the United States. Target sells their products in their 1,897 physical storefronts as well as their online (digital) store. Additionally, Target owns 51 brands that they carry in their stores nationwide.

**Investment Information:** 

*Human Capital:*

Target strives to be an employer of choice so that they can both attract and retain talented workers. Target aims to do this through talent development, engagement, diversity, inclusion, safety, benefits, and compensation plans.

Target offers a work environment that fosters growth and career-development opportunities. This includes providing their employees with the experience and skills necessary to “move up the ladder”. Furthermore, Target recognizes the importance of having a diverse and inclusive workforce, which is why they monitor their levels of diversity and report them in their Annual Workforce Diversity Report.

Additionally, Target has committed themselves to maintaining a safe working environment. They plan to maintain this safe environment through safety programs, which includes both occupation injury, and illness-prevention programs for their team members.

Lastly, Target offers their team members compensation and benefit packages to support them financially, mentally, and physically. Target has committed to a minimum hourly wage of $15/hour to their lowest-ranking members no matter their experience, gender, ethnicity, and offers many positions of advancement to their best workers. Furthermore, Target also has 401K matching programs (up to 5% of their annual wage), paid holiday, vacation, family leave etc., discounts, insurance, assistance programs, tuition reimbursement, incentive programs, equity awards, etc. 

By offering all of these benefits, services, and opportunities to their team members, Target is likely to experience less employee turnover. This is important because low employee turnover rates can help Target to save money and time during the firing/hiring processes. Furthermore, these benefits, services, and opportunities are likely to increase employee morale and happiness, which can lead to their employees feeling more engaged/important which can make them more efficient, and even increase customer satisfaction. This is good for Target as a company as it will help them locate talent when they expand into new geographies, and it might even help increase revenues.

[How Employee Satisfaction Affects Organizational Performance - HR Daily Advisor (blr.com)](https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2017/06/16/employee-satisfaction-affects-organizational-performance/)

*Loyalty Program:*

Target has their own loyalty program that offers their customers 5% discount on most purchases when they use any of the eligible [Target Red-Cards](https://www.target.com/c/redcard-program-rules/-/N-4tgj0?Nao=0). Target has plans to leverage their loyalty program members to increase their visit frequency.

Target is able to offer their 5% cash back on in-store purchases, and 1% cash-back on all purchases that are not made in-store through their partnership with TD Bank. Targets RedCard penetration rate has consistently fell by an annual average of 4.95% (or 1.15 percentage points).

Target offers these cards to collect data from their customers for future marketing and planning events/activities to personalize them for their shoppers and increase engagement.

Furthermore, Target is able to make money through their RedCards by having a large credit spread. This is observed through Target’s high (24.40% variable) APR (Annualized Percentage Return). In 2020, Target made $560M off of their receivables from their debit and credit transactions (through their interest on late payments), however their sales reductions through discounts offered by these cards totalled $1.1B. This is up 27% YoY which outpaces their decrease in revenue from their cards which is 14% YoY.

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analyses (seen in the “investment valuation” section of this report), I needed to find 4 companies that I could use to compare to Target in order to achieve a valuation.

These companies have to be publicly listed, operate in a similar manner, be of similar market cap, operate in similar geographies, and have valid financial ratios and multiples. 

By using the above criteria, I arrived with the following 4 companies that I used in my comparable:

[**$COST - Costco Wholesale Corp**](https://utradea.com/stocks/COST)**:** Costco is a consumer defensive, discount store chain that operates worldwide, however their main operations take place in the USA. Like Target, Costco also carries many brands that they own themselves (among other brands) and sells a variety of products including food, apparel, electronics, appliances, health and beauty etc. Costco has 552 stores in the USA and is a direct competitor to Target.

[**$WMT – Wal-Mart Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/WMT) Wal-Mart operates their supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and discount stores in the US and internationally. Like Target, Wal-Mart is heavily involved in the USA, and offers food, grocery, beauty, health, appliances, home improvement etc. products to their customers. Like Target, Wal-Mart also has an online marketplace.

[**$DG - Dollar General Corp:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/DG) Like Target, Dollar general is a discount store that only operates, and serves their customers in the USA. Furthermore, they both sell food, perishables, beauty products, personal care products etc. Dollar General has over 17,000 stores in the USA (which is significantly more that that of Target.

[**$DLTR – Dollar Tree Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/DLTR) Like Target, Dollar Tree operates their discount variety stores across the USA. However, Dollar Tree offers most of their products for $1, which is one of their selling features. Dollar tree also has similar product offerings to that of Target; however, their selection is not as diverse, and their products are typically not of higher quality.

*COVID-19 Impacts:*

Like many other companies, Target was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in light of this pandemic Target invested $1B into programs to help their team members well-being, health, and safety, which included bonuses paid-leave, wellness resources etc. I believe that by Target taking this initiative amidst uncertain financial results in their future shows that they care for their workers, which reflects well on their brand, image, and potentially productivity and employee retention.

Furthermore, Target acted quickly to ensure that they met the safety, social distancing, and cleanliness measures in place due to the pandemic.

Target experience sales decreases during the start of the pandemic, but this reduction in sales was not long lived and Target was able to bounce back relatively quickly. Furthermore, Target was tasked with navigating and fixing their supply chains, as the pandemic resulted in many supply chain shortages. Target was able to manage their supply chains during the pandemic and did not lose much revenue as a result of supply chain issues.

Overall, Target was able to navigate their way through the pandemic without too much material effects on their business. This ability to navigate through the uncertainty helped Target to achieve greater sales figures than their pre-pandemic financial results.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Target’s sales increased by 20%, their total revenues increased by 20%, their operating income increased by 40%, their EBITDA increased by 24%, their EBIT increased by 39.8%, and they increased their net operating profit by 40%. Furthermore, in 2020 Target was able to open 30 new stores, while only needing to close 1 store, this means they netted 29 new stores, which increased their total stores by 1.5%.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** There is always some bad that comes along with the good, and in 2920 Target had some areas on their financials which were not favourable. Targets cost of sale increased by 21%, which is more than their increase in revenue. This contributes to a lower overall gross margin for Target. Furthermore, Target’s interest expense increase by 105% which is a sizable increase. This was really the only bad that came from Target’s financial performance, which is a fantastic sign for investors.

· **Share Repurchasing:** In 2020, Target repurchased 5,700,000 of their common shares. This repurchase increased the value of the existing shares on the market by approximately 1.13%. This is great to see as an investor, and Target has a track record of repurchasing shares which is even better.

· **Stock Options and Awards:** In 2020, Target issued 2,400,000 shares through option exercising and employee stock awards. Target’s stock awards come in the form of RSU’s (Restricted Stock Units) and PRU’s (Performance Restricted Units). In 2020, Target vested 1,427,000 common shares through their RSU’s, these vested shares are no longer restricted and were added to their total shares outstanding. Furthermore, Target vested 827,000 PRU’s which became un-restricted and were added to the shares outstanding. The remaining 146,000 shares were distributed to the market through the exercising of employee options.

· **Total Dilution:** In 2020, Targets total shares outstanding decreased signifying that each share represents a larger portion of the company than they di 1 year ago. I call this “share inflation”, and Targets shares were inflated by 0.65%. This is fantastic to see as an investor, however Target has inflated their shares by a larger amount in the past (ie. 2.6% in 2019, and 4.4% In 2018). However, this decrease can be attributed to the temporary suspension of their share repurchasing program due to COVID-19.

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:* 

I was able to calculate my own WACC through taking the average result from both my High and Low WACC estimates. By doing this I arrived at an average WACC of 6.91%, which I used in my model.

*CAGR:*

I was able to find Targets gross profit CAGR to be close to 7% over the past 4 years. However, as a result of Targets increased business due to COVID-19, I decided to take a more conservative estimate of 6%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate:*

Over the past 4 years, Targets operating expenses have increase by an average of 6.7% annually. I used this historic increase to predict future results.

*Interest Expense Increase Rate:*

Over the past 4 years, Target’s interest expense has grown at an average rate of 9.8% per year, which I used to forecast future results.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

Over the past 4 years, Target’s depreciation and amortization has grown steadily at an average annual rate of 0.67%.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Target’s effective tax rate for the year 2020 to be 21.2% through Targets [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0000027419-21-000010/#i5d6e11e9e8174675a063efd3d071738e_37).

*Capital Expenditures Decrease Rate:*

Over the past 4 years Target has reduced their capital expenditures by an average of 1.2% per year.

*Risk Free Rate:*

I found Target’s risk free rate to be 2.25% from a website called “[Finbox](https://finbox.com/NYSE:TGT/models/wacc)”, which estimates certain rates (like “risk-free) that are used in financial modelling.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report in order to arrive at a fair value of $337.19/share for Target. This price implies that Target is undervalued, and has an implied upside of 34.28%.

However, in my sensitivity analysis of my DCF model, the lowest and highest valuations that are within +/- 1% of the estimated WACC and Risk-Free Rate are $247-490. These valuations imply that the most conservative estimate for Target is $247 and implies a downside risk of 2%. While the most optimistic valuation implies a potential upside of 95%. Therefore, it is pretty safe to say that Target is undervalued and has some room to grow into.

*Comparable Analyses:*

In order to get a rounded valuation via a comparable analysis, I decided to compare 3 of Targets financial ratio and multiples to that of their competitors (listed above in the “competition” section of this report). These comparable multiples and ratios are as follows:

*EV/EBITDA:*

By comparing Target’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Target’s fair value to be $257/share, which implies an upside of 2%. This comparable implies that Target is in fact undervalued and supports the original argument made by the DCF model.

*EV/Revenue:* 

By comparing Target’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $215/share, which implies a downside of 15%. This is the only valuation that implies that Target is undervalued, so I decided to do one more comparable to get a final consensus.

*P/E:*

By comparing Targets P/E ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $314/share, which implies an upside of 25%. This confirms that Target is undervalued and is similar to the result as achieved in the DCF model.

*Average Comparable:*

In order to get one all-encompassing valuation from my comparable analyses, I decided to take the average of the 3 results which I arrived at. By doing this I arrived at a final fair value of $262/share, which implies an upside of 4%.

*Dividend Discount Model:*

The final valuation model that I used in order to value Target is a Dividend Discount Model. This model factors in the average growth rate of Targets dividend, their WACC, and this year’s total amount paid in dividends. By doing this I arrived at a fair value of $226, which implies a downside risk of an investment into Target of 10%. This is the only valuation metric that argues that Target is overvalued.

**Plan:**

When formulating my investment plan, I decided to take the average result achieved through the 3 different valuation models/techniques used in my valuation. By doing this I arrived at one fair value of Target of $274.99/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 9.5%.

**Risks:** 

· **Post-Covid Sales Slowing:** In their [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0000027419-21-000010/#i5d6e11e9e8174675a063efd3d071738e_37), Target stated that they exhibited better sales figures as a result of the pandemic. This helped Target to outperform in 2020, however, what will happen once Covid-19 is no longer a factor? If Targets sales stagnate or even decrease after the pandemic, it would hurt their stock price.

· **Financial Performance:** Although Target’s financial performance in 2020 was good, there is still room for error in the future. Currently, it appears as though Target is moving in the right track and has the potential to continue to post good earnings. However, investors may start to expect this, and if Target starts to fall short on their earnings, then these investors may be quick to exit.

**Catalysts:**

· **Share Repurchasing:** Overall, in 2020 Target purchased more shares than they offered to the markets. This in itself is a very good sign and will help increase value for shareholders over the long run. However, the best part of all of this has to be that Target was able to achieve this feat after their repurchasing program was temporarily suspended. Maybe we will see Target repurchase more shares this year to make up for the suspension, who knows? However, if they can keep up this share “inflation” than Target will continue to remain an attractive buy.

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Target had a fantastic financial performance. If Target can continue to overcome adversities and continue to have good financial performances consistently, then more investors will be interested and buy shares which will help the share price.

· **Post-Covid Performance:** We know that Target’s great financial performance this year can be attributed to the effects of COVID. We know this because Target stated it in their annual report, however if Target is able to maintain a similar financial performance after COVID-19 has concluded, they will prove to investors that they did not just “get lucky” with COVID-19, and that they can continue to perform well.

o836w4_TGT,TGT,$TGT is criminally undervalued and has a lot of upside potential in these coming months,"Target is currently trading at around $240 per share. Firstly, I believe it's undervalued based on its price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.58, when compared to its competitors (COSTCO has a P/E of 36.589, Walmart has a P/E of 31.829). A look at the Enterprise value to EBIDTA ratio (EV/EBIDTA) tells a similar story. It should be noted, though, that TGT has a higher debt-to-equity of 1.02 ratio than some Costco and Walmart, although it isn't high enough to raise concerns about its risk. Based on fundamentals alone, it seems like a solid pick.

This is supported by the fact that it absolutely crushed earnings back in April, beating EPS by a whopping 104.36% and revenue by a reasonable 14.24%. It saw a nice pump after earnings was disclosed, but it has still steadily increased in price since then (6.1% in the last month).

I think that it will continue to grow now that summer is here and there is increased shopping, not to mention reopening and lifting of COVID restrictions.

nsw5e3_TGT,TGT,$TGT is going to 300+ EOY,"So now that many of you apes have had fun playing around with worthless companies, Allow me to present some solid due diligence on a solid profitable company gaining more market share year over year in the incredibly competitive retail environment. I will divide my bull case for $TGT into 4 sections.

1. The story that Q1 earnings told us/new PE ratio of 19:

They absolutely set themselves apart from every other retailer. By posting an absolute blowout quarter (3.69 EPS actual: expected 2.25) driven by strength in apparel and general merchandise, they basically told investors that they can deal with inflation much better than Costco or Walmart that have a much higher dependence on groceries which have lower profit margins. Additionally Target owns personal brands and this allows their profit margins to increase. For apparel they have Goodfellow, grocery they have good and gather, market pantry, and a new dessert brand called Favorite Day. By popularizing these brands, they are able to cut out the middle men for products that don’t require a massive brand name to sell. 

2. Semi Re-Opening Play

Going forward they have announced they are opening up changing rooms as Covid restrictions wind down. Many people viewed Target as a covid winner, however I believe that their apparel department can allow them to also function as a pseudo-re-opening play. With a PE ratio of 19, it is likely that the stock continues to go up with little to no near term catalysts especially if the market continues to go up. They have tough comparisons to compete with especially for Q2 2020, however they most likely can surpass that quarter if they continue to post sales of high margin products. They literally beat earnings every quarter. These guys are ruthless in cutting costs, that’s why on slower days if you walk into a Target you’ll barely any employees. They actually don’t give a fuck and will bully the few people running the store into doing as much as humanely possible.

3. (Target)ing the right demographics and easy access to urban markets

Target has announced plans to continue building stores in areas they deem a great opportunity to steal market share from competition. Like putting stores near by college campuses. In recent years they have built mini Target stores in places all over New York City and other densely populated cities (before Amazon Go had any chance to establish itself) Walmart doesn’t have a reach in this environment because their business model revolves around suburbia and rural markets. The design of their stores, the products they sell are all designed to gear towards a younger millennial Gen z population. Go to a target, literally any Target. They are all the same, you’ll bump into some chicks, employees with highlighted hair, and you might see some younger people wandering around like they’re lost ducklings. I don’t think these habits will go away even when the economy fully re-opens. 

4. The e-commerce strategy has been working

This one is rather self explanatory. The omnichannel strategy has been incredibly successful. Far more successful than Walmart. Surveys have indicated that these habits of using shipt and order pickup will persist in the new economy that is forming. They also compete with Amazon on their prime day with no extra charge to consumers and price match whenever they have a sale on something to stay competitive. 


TLDR: TGT is a solid re-opening play as we keep some habits from the pandemic and profit margins go up. My PT for TGT is 300 by the end of the year.

lg4jel_NET,NET,$KTRA - Price Target +250%!,"Hello pennypeople, this is my 2nd DD :)

[Last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lcpdsj/stock_with_great_upside_potential_abeo/) is up 38% in 2 trading days!

The company I looked at is **Kintara Therapeutics**

Market cap is only **$51.79m**!

&#x200B;

**ABOUT**

**Kintara Therapeutics** ($**KTRA**) is a clinical stage drug development company. They focus on developing and commercializing anti-cancer therapies to treat cancer patients. They are developing two late-stage, Phase III-ready therapeutics, including VAL-083, a DNA-targeting agent for the treatment of drug-resistant solid tumors.

**Catalyst**

[Q1 data announcement on](https://scr.zacks.com/News/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2020/KTRA-VAL-083-Poster-Updates-article/default.aspx):

* MGMT-unmethylated newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
* MGMT-unmethylated Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme

Kintara is completing **multiple** Phase II trials for VAL-083 to treat **brain cancer**, one of the most difficult malignancies to address. VAL-083 has several features that make it particularly appropriate for GBM, including its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its mechanism of action which introduces irreversible DNA crosslinks that are not easily overcome by MGMT repair enzymes.

No one is even talking about this company so if it gains some momentum the price target is quite fair.

They also have an **earnings call on 11th**.

The cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2020, along with the proceeds from warrant exercises received subsequent to September 30, 2020, are expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's planned operations into the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021. For the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $19.5 million, or $1.33 per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $1.6 million, or $0.21 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. The increase in the current quarter was largely due to the recognition of $16.0 million of non-cash expenses related to the acquisition of in-process research and development costs associated with the Adgero transaction.

**PRICE TARGET**

The average price target is $5.75 with a high forecast of $7.00 and a low forecast of $5.00. The average price target represents a **273.8% increase** from the last price of $2.10.

**Analyst target:** KTRA has a rating of **buy** on marketbeat, yahoofinance, marketwatch.

**Their Platform Strategy**

""Our platform strategy is built on a robust understanding of cancer biology. We use modern approaches in our laboratory studies to determine where we can solve problems in the treatment of drug and immune resistant cancer.

Our team has identified niches in the continuum of care where our therapeutic may address an unmet need. By showing that our treatments are active where others fail, we can implement clinical studies to demonstrate that our therapies may have the ability to improve patient outcomes.""

lg34s8_XOM,XOM,Good targets for LEAPS,"I’m looking to invest a small portion of my portfolio into LEAPS. Ideally I’d like to build 10-20 positions over the next 6 months focused on companies with potential for a solid 1-2 year payoff. These would be positions where the risk/reward profile makes enough sense to justify buying the options as opposed to just holding the stock for 1-2 years.

My general thoughts are to look at plays that benefit from increased inflation, increased infrastructure spending, and a focus on ESG. I have tremendous respect for the wealth of knowledge in this community, so I thought this would be a good place to get some ideas to begin my research.

Any ideas on some good long term options plays?",2021-02-09,8,15
lfr1hj_MRNA,MRNA,UPDATE: NEW TNXP DD With New TNX-2100 Covid Skin Test Information Included. Looking at a $4+ Price Target Into Q3-Q4,"DD for TNXP. Looks great to me, tell me what you think. Multiple drugs in FDA trial, conservative price target at $4+ 


Credit u/captTEM


**First off, the stock is finally moving. Why is it moving?**

As of today, TNXP announced that they will begin developing a Covid 19 skin test.


**TNX-2100 is the name for their new Covid-19 skin test** that TNXP will begin developing this calendar year. This skin test will be very similar to existing skin test like the TB. “[The] Intradermal Test is Designed to Measure SARS-CoV-2 Specific Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTH), the Classic Method of Measuring T Cell Immunity to Tuberculosis and Other Pathogens”


This means that TNXP will be pulling from existing methods of using T Cell Immunity measurement used for Tuberculosis but will instead gear the test to illicit a immune response to Covid viral particles allowing doctor to know whether or not you have/have had the virus.


[Yahoo Finance Article Discussing Announcement](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/tonix-pharmaceuticals-develop-covid-19-120000546.html) 


This past week, TNXP also received a Notice of Allowance on 2/1 from the US Patent and Trademark Office for Application No. 16/518,338, titled: EUTECTIC FORMULATIONS OF CYCLOBENZAPRINE HYDROCHLORIDE.  What is CYCLOBENZAPRINE HYDROCHLORIDE you may ask? 


**Their main drug is  TNX-102 SL** (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets), HCI stands for Hydrochloride in medical terms. This means that their new patent is regarding their main drug.  Tonix is developing TNX-102 SL as a potential treatment for the symptoms of Fibromyalgia. It is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.  The Fibromyalgia market is huge, and people is not satisfied with the medications that is available today.


[The market](https://preview.redd.it/fmrgadkgugf61.png?width=2157&amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b66b43c92f45908c9c3c27d790bc45c7ea25165a)


&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;


[People are not satisfied with the medications that are available today](https://preview.redd.it/0e3pwfkougf61.png?width=2215&amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;s=a9cf8d398d2e7542258c1211eb1a94dcc0ea8687)


So this TNX-102 SL could be huge long term.   Data from second Phase 3 trial due 2H 2021.


The TNX-102 SL is ongoing a phase 3 for PTSD, Phase 2 ready for treating Alzheimer, Phase 2 ready for treating alcohol use disorder. A lot of upcoming catalysts here. 


**TNXP is also developing a Covid-19 Vaccine**


 TNX-1800 (TNX-1810, TNX-1820, TNX-1830) is their preclinical Covid-19 vaccine. This vaccine is different from the ones that are out today (Pzifer and Moderna) as this is a live virus. Using the Horsepox viral particles, TNXP has altered the spike proteins on the virus to elicit an immune response similar enough to COVID 19 in order to produce antibodies. While this is a slightly more primitive method of vaccination relative to the mRNA vaccines, it is still a historically successful method of vaccination.


[TNX-1800 goes under  \\""Live Attenuated virus\\"", so as you can see these vaccines takes much longer time to make. The vaccine in this category that is closest to release is still in phase 1. Which means that TNXP probably isn't far behind.](https://preview.redd.it/b963x6l1rgf61.png?width=650&amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;s=82c3a02e19a6a05edb46e84c4ac79c527942fbf2)


Their non-human primate results is expected **1st Quarter 2021**, it was rumored that this would come out late January/early February if i remember correctly  (couldn't find my source on this). This to me makes sense why they would discuss "" the importance of having multiple vaccine options, and protecting against forward transmission"" two days ago. As that gives them more media coverage when they release the results.


Here is some info from their website:


*TNX-1800, as a horsepox vaccine, has potential advantages over vaccinia-based vaccines, including:*


* *Maintains strong immunogenicity with potentially improved tolerability*
* *Relative to non-replicating vaccinia, horsepox’s replication in human cells provides direct antigen presentation by Class I MHC*
* *Horsepox may behave differently as a vector, in part because of its different repertoire of genes that modulate immune responses and host range*

[Last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lcpdsj/stock_with_great_upside_potential_abeo/) is up 38% in 2 trading days!

The company I looked at is **Kintara Therapeutics**

Market cap is only **$51.79m**!

&#x200B;

**ABOUT**

**Kintara Therapeutics** ($**KTRA**) is a clinical stage drug development company. They focus on developing and commercializing anti-cancer therapies to treat cancer patients. They are developing two late-stage, Phase III-ready therapeutics, including VAL-083, a DNA-targeting agent for the treatment of drug-resistant solid tumors.

**Catalyst**

[Q1 data announcement on](https://scr.zacks.com/News/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2020/KTRA-VAL-083-Poster-Updates-article/default.aspx):

* MGMT-unmethylated newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
* MGMT-unmethylated Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme

Kintara is completing **multiple** Phase II trials for VAL-083 to treat **brain cancer**, one of the most difficult malignancies to address. VAL-083 has several features that make it particularly appropriate for GBM, including its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its mechanism of action which introduces irreversible DNA crosslinks that are not easily overcome by MGMT repair enzymes.

No one is even talking about this company so if it gains some momentum the price target is quite fair.

They also have an **earnings call on 11th**.

lde6gs_TGT,TGT,$TGT has had some really consistent price movement and is starting to go up again,"Target is a pretty slow, but consistently rising stock. It also has a very consistent pattern for the past 6 months. It will reach a peak and drop, then in almost exactly a month from that peak, it hits that peak again and surpasses it by a good bit.

Looking at where they're at now, they recently peaked at about $200 on 1/13 and they're moving up again. With the trend they've had, they should move from their current $189 to $200+ in the next week to two. This seems like a fairly quick and easy swing trade for options. 

If you date your options out a bit as well, you have the safety of Target just being a solid company and IV will likely be steadily increasing until their earnings on 3/2.

ky0qaa_TGT,TGT,Making the case for Target Corp ($TGT)?,"I've been a shareholder of Target since they started their revamp plan (~$72). The new stores + new methods of shopping (drive up, pick up in store, Shipt acquisition) attracted me to their company and I've been a happy shareholder since.


I don't have many shares (12) but was considering selling out of all I have. I'm not sure if the thesis has changed (a quality company with a continuous dividend has a good plan forward with solid management) but the price makes me wary. The run up has been immense and even if I wanted to buy more of the company I cannot (Fair value is ~$90 IMO). The EPS and revenue have jumped but they took out a credit line ""for insurance"" then promptly gave it back in the same quarter which seems a little weird to me. They also made a case that their small format stores will be able to grow profits on a square foot basis which also seemed a little fanciful to me when everyone is still at home.


With the clear overvaluation of many companies ($TGT included) and the odd stimulus situation in the K shaped economy which might prevent people from shopping at target and coral them to cheaper discount stores or higher end retail, I'm not sure if it's good to keep holding on to this company. Would any of you be able to make the case for/against selling target both in a buy and sell capacity?",2021-01-15,11,40
kwcf9r_REGN,REGN,$REGN price target after $2.6B Govt Contract,"Volume was low when it hit high during the day. Aftermarket hours, ARK invests 42,965 shares pumping the stock to ATH of 532. Aftermarket and we are up 2.92%. Would recommend call options or long term stock positions for less risk.

Catalyst is that the US government is paying $2.6B to REGN in order to produce 1.25 million dozes of their new anti-body vaccine. 
This is payout is 25% of their revenue of the year. 

Moreover, their fundamentals are solid. They have consistently beat their expected earnings. No doubt it will hit ATH of $660 by the end of the month or earlier.  

The technicals and news align perfectly with what happened with TSLA at 379 before it shoot through the moon. And the best part is that REGN has better fundamentals. 

They are a good company with a 52 week high of 600 and are trading at their lows. They have consistently met the earnings expectations. There is an expected leap tomorrow as the news on government contract is released. 

I am personally holding call options on this stock expiring on Jan 15 but I recommend going for long term. A good entry would be early morning on open after a slight pullback (probably 520-530). Price target would be 660 and Stop loss at 505.

In other words, in the third quarter alone, it had to figure out how to manage the equivalent of a more than a year’s worth of growth. And that’s after experiencing a huge sales increase in the second quarter. It’s an utterly herculean operational lift — requiring a rethinking of supply chain, inventory management and labor models — and it bodes well for Target’s long-term prospects that it was able to adapt to these conditions so quickly.""

jssdj1_BNTX,BNTX,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why," 

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say.",2020-11-12,36,44

More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say.",2020-11-12,41,44

jp9t3d_ISRG,ISRG,Trying to get a handle on valuations and target prices,"One of the things I've been focusing more on as I become a more experienced investor is understanding valuations and identifying target prices for stocks I want.  As I described in my recent thread about sitting on the sidelines this week, I had raised some cash for an impending market drop and developed a shopping list of stocks I wanted.  I missed good buying opportunities because the market rebounded so sharply and none of my stocks came anywhere near their targets.  But clearly I don't have a good handle on valuing growth stocks and identifying targets.

Since I don't have the time or expertise to get really fancy with fundamentals, I rely on P/S and P/E ratios to get a sense of valuations.  I look at those ratios relative to company peers, and relative to the typical range for that particular stock.  For example, if a stock was trading at a P/S range of 8-15 for the past two years, and is now trading at a P/S of 35, I consider that overpriced.  I develop target prices by picking a P/S or P/E range, based partly on the stock's history and expected future growth.  So in the example above, with a P/S range of 8-15, I might develop a target price based on a forward P/S range of 15-20.

Here's the problem, though.  When it comes to high growth stocks, my price targets are far too low because the valuations of these stocks have gotten so out of whack.  TTD is a great example.  I set a target price of around $400 based on future growth and started to get excited as it dropped to around $550, but then it shot back up and is now way out of my price range.  TTD is now trading at a P/E of 325 and forward P/E of almost 200, and a P/S of 45.

I hear people say that you can't pay such close attention to these ratios with growth stocks because they can grow so quickly, and at some point in their histories everyone thought stocks like AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, etc, were overpriced.  But their ratios never got too out of whack like today's growth stocks are.  The P/E sometimes does because earnings can be volatile, but I've found the P/S ratio to be pretty reliable.  Let's look at some examples of high priced stocks:

AMZN: historical P/S range of 1.1-4.5 (now a touch higher)

AAPL: historical P/S range of 1.7-5.6 (now a touch higher)

GOOG: 5.2-7.5 (currently within that range)

ISRG: 5-21 (currently within that range)

BKNG: 1.7-8.9 (currently within that range)

BABA: 6.7-16 (currently within that range)

MELI: 5-15 (now at 23)

But now look at some of the popular high growth stocks:

TTD: 5-20 (now at 45!)

DOCU: 6-36

NET: 12-19 (now at 51!)

NIO: 1.8-7.5 (now at 34!)

CRWD: now at 44

What do you notice?  The current P/S ratios of those growth stocks is way, way higher than most of the other big stocks ever were in their histories.  The most ""overpriced"" any of those stocks ever got in their histories was ISRG at a P/S of 21, and yet all of the current growth stocks are at P/S ratios twice that.  The ratios for stocks like CRWD and NET are 10-11x higher than AMZN's highest P/S ratio in its history.

Are these stocks overpriced and will eventually come down to more reasonable valuation levels?  Or are we seeing a fundamental change in the way growth stocks are valued?  Is this year's P/S ratio of 40 equivalent to a P/S ratio of 10 from five years ago?  How do we make sense of this?",2020-11-06,11,10

Why TGT?  

Valued at $80.0B as of this morning, Target is an evolving tech and fulfillment company with the brick and mortar to support the balance sheet.  They are amazing at supply chain management.  

They will continue to grow in the Ecom space and gain loyalty as time goes on.  Their operations continue to DOMINATE the grocery space, far better than WMT, KR, or Whole Foods, owned by AMZN.  

The holiday season will see almost 200,000 seasonal fulfillment workers.  

Their projected earnings are a softball target, IMO.  They should beat easily.  We could see a Costco type drop after earnings, but I’m not worried about it for the long term which I’ve shown above.  

I’ve got TGT valued at $120B.  

Not the sexiest YOLO ever, but it feels like a no brainer.  This will be a $200 stock next year, possibly by December depending on a lot of things.

izvjbp_TGT,TGT,People are SLEEPING on TGT,"&#x200B;

Everyone's been so busy circle jerking about WMT's small pee pee stake in tiktok, while the real e-commerce BDE growth story is TGT. Since absolutely crushing last Q earnings, the stock is back to all-time highs (even while S&P has sold off hard). The relative strength is enormous, and this stock will absolutely rip higher if market turns bullish. TGT digital sales are tripling so far this year, and expect this to accelerate in 2H. Digital sales have gone from 7% of the company revenues to approaching 20% now. if you apply SHOP or BIGC crazy high revenue multiples to that $4 billion of e-commerce sales for TGT it implies a $160B market cap for TGT (instead of today's $77B). Vol is incredibly cheap for the options.

EDIT: Lot of comments about the stock not being cheap bc its at an ATH.   I think if market hadn't pulled back last month TGT would be 10-20% higher today.  Some more numbers, annualizing Q2 revenue and EPS numbers: TGT is very cheap versus WMT, SHOP (obviously), and even the overall market (S&P500).

At 200% growth rates, TGT e-commerce sales will approach 50% of total revenues in \~2 years.  Stock is gonna revalue to a higher multiple.   If you value JUST the 17% of TGT that is e-commerce in the same way that market is valuing SHOP (P/SALES multiple) TGT has 100% upside today.

My thoughts: It's interesting to see the much smaller expected moves of companies set to report this week (towards the end of earnings season) as opposed to what we saw a few weeks ago. That's probably reflective of two things, the first is that overall market volatility is much lower now (VIX \~22). And somewhat related, these company's expected moves are now isolating their own earnings as opposed to picking up the uncertainty of other companies and the overall market. More than 90% of the other companies have already reported, including many of their peers. This is probably as pure an earnings reaction move as we've seen since the Covid selloff.

(while also hopefully having some form of guidance because that's been killin winning stocks lately.)

It's very hard to gauge at the moment, internal stores I've been to, and sales talk seem to indicate Target has done well, but it hasn't had the same run up or cofidence from investors as Walmart or even Home Depot, both of which didn't gain as expected, though Home Depot at least made some sense, while Walmart was a wtf moment.

Another variable to consider is Target extending their extra $2 an hour for their workers which may have caused some issues in financing or may have been a drop of water in a bucket, but until the morning we will have no way of knowing.

This seems to be a risky play, but considering what happened to Walmart, I will yolo based on the belief that the crazy market will skyrocket Target. I will find a way to figure out this upside down market, if even it's impossible!.

The Globe's David Leeder writes that Ms. Hedlin says in a note: The deal is expected to increase High Tide's B2B consulting and management services revenues, while monetizing leases and development permits. ... The sale also allows High Tide to focus on its Canna Cabana branded stores versus developing two retail brands, which could reduce marketing costs. While we believe the main drawback of the sale is the receipt of shares versus cash (given that it could take several quarters to convert stock to cash at unknown prices), we still believe the company negotiated a good deal considering that it acquired its partner's 50-per-cent interest in Kush Bar for $1.2-million in mid-December 2019. Lastly, based on our current forecasts, we estimate that the company is now fully funded, assuming Halo's stock price is sustained at current levels.""

epnjnd_TSLA,TSLA,"My revised (again) model of TSLA through 2028 (Price Target of $17,600 in 2028)","Hi gang,

I posed two different models in the last 6 years that I'm continually revisiting and updating based on new data that's available to me.

Here's the first one below from 6 years ago where I attached a $450 price target by end of 2018
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&sh=78a9694b

Here's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&sh=43f78d64

It appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.

In no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.

See below model:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing

My broad assumptions:

* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028
* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric
* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year
* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model
* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025
* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin
* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY
* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network
* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto
* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028
* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028

That covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.

The price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.

Let me know your thoughts.

I’m a toy reseller and Target has been beating Walmart and Amazon in deals all of last quarter. Target now is trying to Put a CVS in all of their stores in order to reduce their cost in rent by leasing out part of their cost onto CVS. It’s a massive advantage to have a name brand pharmacy right in your store. Plus if we look at how well Wal-Mart recently did it would be difficult to even consider puts. Targets also sometimes have Starbucks in them only furthering their profit margin. Target sitting at around $85-90 a share, by the books, in theory this stock is UNDERVALUED. It also has a buy rating by most analysts for this reason. Target has been pushed against the wall and is now throwing out hard punches at the competition. As for the bearish case there’s a small chance a recession would hurt them especially if Chinese tariffs worsen, however I believe this is speculation when compared to the raw statistics of this stock. Don’t expect a 10% move but a 5% move would not be surprising.

Anyway, the press release I originally read turned out to be a summary of another article that discussed how larger pot companies are making a concerted, aggressive effort to purchase smaller dispensaries and growers in Pennsylvania (USA).  The release mentioned Choom, Aurora, Fire and Flower, Curaleaf, and National Access Cannabis; and it appears the press release I read last week was basically a synopsis of an article/story/scoop by Sam Wood that was posted by The Philadelphia Inquirer.  The post by Sam Wood (Updated June 4, 2019) has much more information about the goings-on in the local pot/weed marketplace and I'm including it here (fingers crossed that this link is still active):

BTW - Whether or not the above link remains active at the time your are reading this is not as important (in my opinion) as what I found interesting in the cited article, regarding the following (as quoted from my PDF):

\--

""With the possible legalization of recreational use on the radar, large marijuana companies are looking at a $22.7 billion national market by 2023. In many states, the competition to acquire cannabis licenses was intense. Both big established companies and mom & pop startups rushed to be granted a license to operate retail dispensaries for medical and, where legal, recreational marijuana sales. In the aftermath, the playing field has morphed into a free for all, of sorts by larger companies, trying to increase their retail operations by gobbling up the smaller licensees. A recent article in the paper of record for Philadelphia, The Philadelphia Inquirer, outlined how the game has changed in Pennsylvania and in most other states: ""The companies that are already in place as medical operators will have first-mover advantage in the recreational market,"" said (the) director of research for the Brightfield Group, ""So in the East, we expect continued mergers and acquisitions activity."" Among the 75 or so companies that won permits in Pennsylvania, several still haven't grown or sold a single gram of cannabis. And yet, many have entertained interest from multi-state operators like Harvest. ""The speed at which it's happening is blistering."" Active companies in the industry making moves to ready that include: Choom(TM) Holdings Inc. (OTCQB: CHOOF) (CSE: CHOO), Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NYSE: ACB) (TSX: ACB), Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. (OTCPK: FFLWF) (TSX-V: FAF), Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. (CSE: CURA) (OTCQX: CURLF), National Access Cannabis Corp. (TSX-V: META) (OTCPK: NACNF).

\[My emphasis\] ***""A dispensary that's open and functional is worth $10 million plus,""*** said a cannabis industry executive from Chicago, who asked not to be identified because his company is seeking to buy additional Pennsylvania properties. ""A grow that's dormant is worth $15 million. But if the grow is up and running and producing, it could be worth more than $35 million."" With the uncertainty in the long-term market, it's hard to fault the small companies for cashing out. ""These facilities cost so much (they) can't get mortgages or loans from banks. If you want to grow, I don't know where else you'd get the money.""

\--

For the sake of argument I'm assuming that the ""$10 million plus"" figure quoted above is in USD.  In addition, and taking into consideration the worst-case/weakest-ever five year exchange rate of USD 1.00 = CAD 1.45 (Jan 15, 2016), it seems to me that ""a dispensary that's open and functional"" could be valued at around ~~CAD~~ USD 6.9M based on the above... so let's round that figure down and call it an even ~~CAD~~ USD 6.0 million per ""open and functional dispensary"" (just for the sake of argument).

With this calculation in mind, I clicked over to check out the NewLeaf Cannabis website and counted 10 recreational dispensaries that I believe - based on their website - are ""open and functional"" at the time of this post.  (ie. Each dispensary has posted hours so I'm assuming they are open.)

And now to my point...

Based on the above math, it seems to me that National Access Cannabis could be/may be ~~fairly~~ undervalued~~, as of the close of business today (Aug 14, 2019), based on a market cap valuation, and taking into consideration all posted/available outstanding common shares, as far as I've read in the SEDAR filings (ie. USD 0.38 / CAD 0.49), based solely on those 10 NewLeaf Cannabis locations.~~

I admit there may be (probably are) gaping holes in my thesis here (and I'm hoping for assistance!), ~~but it seems to me that National Access Cannabis could be fairly valued - at the moment, in terms of market cap - at the current stock price, based on the information provided in the article and/or link cited above, which I find interesting - based solely on 10 open stores.~~

So that's what I'm thinking...

Granted, this post only cites a single, random Chicago source that ""asked not to be identified"" so I realize and accept that my entire thesis could be complete nonsense - fair enough.  But I just found it incredibly interesting that there is now a figure out there in the open - in the marketplace - that refers to the perceived and/or estimated market value of an ""open and functional"" dispensary.  That's my point.  Will it stick?  Who knows?

\--

And here's where I should have stopped... but since it's my first post... ""Fuck it"" I said to myself...

\--

In terms of fantasy math (ie. longs/bag holders/dreamers), I also acknowledge that there's a dilutionary ""shelf prospectus"" of \~CAD 200M (\~USD 137M) outstanding (as well as other warrants and options, etc.) that - truth be told - not every shareholder fully understands, which is fine with me.  However, it also seems to me that the entire CAD 200M prospectus, which has been approved, along with any outstanding options and warrants, could basically be absorbed by the additional opening of, maybe, 20-35 dispensaries (30-45 recreational dispensaries total).  Maybe?

Again, just for the sake of argument, let me posit a worst-case scenario whereby the entire float of shares, including warrants, options, etc. is much, much, larger than I think... What if - for example - the total number of outstanding shares were something as high as 500 million outstanding??  Hopefully not!  But what then?

Call me crazy (take a number and get in line), but even in such a disastrous, dilutive case, and positing that each ""open and functional"" dispensary is worth approximately ~~CAD~~ USD 6M (based on the math above), then it would appear to me that the company would require about 80-90 stores in total to achieve fair value at such and exaggerated level, based on pure fantasy math.

Whether or not any future ""open and functional"" dispensaries actually open on time, within budget, and/or remain functional is a-whole-other post... but, based on my readings of the company's SEDAR filings it seems that it's possible.  Maybe?  Maybe not? Who knows?

Either way, I think it's an interesting stock - short or long... (I happen to be long)

BTW, this is my first post and I'm not sure how this all work so be kind, be cool - and be professional.  Feel free to poke holes in the thesis.  I welcome your comments and suggestions, and I promise to dig deeper to provide additional facts to support and/or refute any position that's not mine.  I'm just another stockholder in search of how to value an emerging company.

9yrybl_TGT,TGT,"Target shares tumble 9% as earnings miss mark, weighed down by higher costs","https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/target-reports-q3-2018-earnings.html

* * *
TGT on Tuesday reported a mixed quarter, with revenue slightly topping analysts estimates but earnings falling short, as investments in its supply chain weighed on profits.

Despite the earnings miss, Target maintained its forecast for the full year, and said it's ""better positioned for this holiday season than ever before.""

Its shares were down 9 percent in premarket trading after falling as much as 10 percent.

Here's what Target reported for its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a poll of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, vs. $1.12 expected
Revenue: $17.82 billion vs. $17.80 billion expected
Same-store sales: up 5.1 percent vs. growth of 5.2 percent expected
Net income grew to $622 million, or $1.17 per share, compared with $478 million, or 87 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Target earned $1.09 per share, short of expectations for $1.12 per share, based on a survey by Refinitiv.

Total revenue climbed 5.6 percent from a year ago to $17.82 billion, slightly beating analysts' estimates.

Sales at Target stores open for at least 12 months were up 5.1 percent, slightly short of expectations for growth of 5.2 percent. The company said digital sales rose 49 percent during the third quarter and contributed 1.9 percentage points to same-store sales growth. It said the number of transactions at its stores jumped 5.3 percent, while the average shopper's ticket dropped 0.2 percent.

Target said its strongest sales gains during the quarter came from the toys, baby and beauty categories. The company has notably been devoting more space in some stores to sell toys following the demise of Toys R Us.

But investors were concerned about how higher expenses were eating into profits. Target's third-quarter gross margin rate fell to 28.7 percent from 29.6 percent a year ago, with the company attributing the decline to higher supply chain costs as it fulfills more online orders ahead of the holiday season. It also said it ordered more holiday-related inventory ahead of the fourth quarter, earlier than when it did last year.

Target continues to expect adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year to fall within a range of $5.30 to $5.50. For the holiday quarter, it's anticipating same-store sales will be up roughly 5 percent.

""We plan to leverage our current momentum into 2019,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement.

But first, Target has to prove it can keep the momentum going through this holiday season, where some companies can make as much as 30 percent of their annual sales. The retailer has been pouring money into store renovations, while opening up smaller-format locations in urban cities and college towns. It continues to add more in-house brands for apparel and home goods, which offer higher margins than national labels. And it's investing in logistics to be more competitive with Walmart and Amazon. This holiday season, for example, Target is dropping its minimum purchase threshold for free, two-day shipping, while Walmart still has a $35 threshold.

Target also said Tuesday it has met its hiring goals for the holidays to bring on 120,000 seasonal workers. There's been some concern, more broadly, that retailers won't be able to meet these lofty hiring goals with such a tight labor market in the U.S.

As of Monday's market close, Target shares have rallied more than 35 percent over the past 12 months, bringing its market cap to roughly $41.1 billion.",2018-11-20,79,38

Anyway, I'm wondering if it is worthwhile to continue holding CVS and PG.  Here's my analysis so far:

**Pros for CVS:**

* Acquisition of Aetna might be profitable.  
* Integration of Aetna, drug store, PBM, clinic, might be profitable.
* Jim Cramer recently gave the stock a favorable review.  I'm not a Cramer fan, but good that at least someone notable likes the stock, so it's not like I'm on a lone quixotic quest.

**Cons for CVS:**

* The convenience store portion is crap.  Every CVS I've been to is ghost-town.  I am shocked they are still in business.  I mean, a bag of candies that cost like $2 in Walmart is like $4 in CVS.  It's nuts.
* Health insurance competition is great.  Humana, UNH, Wellpoint, local small timers, HMOs, etc.

For PG:

**Pros for PG:**

* Well-established brands
* Diversified brands
* Staples (even if economy goes sour, people still need to brush their teeth)

**Cons for PG:** 

* Tariff exposure
* Millennial birth rate is not very good, from what I heard, and that affects their baby supplies business
* Lack of innovation re new products

8ojfj4_TGT,TGT,My play on TGT,"Just wanted to share a play I made with my rationale for entering it.

I was following TGT during their earnings.  Right before the earnings, it was approaching an area of resistance - with the RSI reaching the top, with no real signs of prior weakness.  It gapped down about $4 dollars after their earnings report, missing by $0.07 - but they still posted strong numbers.  

I waited until 5/25 (3rd day post-earnings) to enter a long position with the assumption that TGT was going back up.  The technical indicators were pretty good, and the IV was low - so I felt it was an appropriate time to go long.

My position was a synthetic long static delta backspread:

- TGT was trading around $71.

- Bought 2 JUL 18 65 Calls ($7.17 x 2 - roughly $1.17 of extrinsic)

- Sold 1 JUL 18 70 Call ($3.35; $2.35 of extrinsic)

The premium collected from the short call paid for all of the premium of the long call (+$2.35 for the short and -$1.17 x 2 for the longs).  Long with a neutral theta - the only way I like it!

Today, TGT is up $5 from when I entered the position - so I closed it for a $500 win.  My target profit was around $1k ($81), but I was happy enough with today's $3 move.  Had TGT moved lower after the 4th-5th day (after earnings), I would have got out immediately - as this would have been an indicator that my initial assumption was wrong.

This trade tied up $1100 in capital, vs. the $7100 of capital it would have used to long 100 shares @$71.  

This is an example of how to use options as an alternative method for holding stock - and a much cheaper (less capital) way of doing it.

The most I could have lost was $1100, and that would have only been the case if TGT fell under $60 while I was holding.  There would have been the same amount of loss had I bought 100 shares at $71, with a drop to $60.

7pjuhh_TGT,TGT,Should I sell $TGT (Target),"Here’s the gist:

I’ve been in TGT for a few months now. Bought it as a value play when everyone thought Amazon was going to take over the world the next day. (Amazon’s done quite well but y’all know what I mean). 

Got in at $53 and now I’m up about 33%. I believe that it’s been pumped because of the combination of the Amazon acquisition rumors and the note saying that holiday sales were strong. 

I’m most likely going to sell before earnings are reposted...

My reasoning: if TGT doesn’t beat sales expectations AND offer strong guidance the stock will sell off. Remember, it got up to these levels based on news. My experience tells me to sell the news.

6c3xp0_TGT,TGT,$TGT Target is undervalued due to failing competitors. Will see $65+ before EoY. Long post.,"As many of you know, B&M retailers have recently been struggling, some outright failing. Im not here to tell you that Target is going back to all time highs. I am here to tell you the company is currently undervalued, and that it is worth a 6 month buy and hold.


In December 2016 Target was trading at $78 as the previous 3 quarters had been outstanding, beating guidance by .10, .11, and .21, historically they have beaten EPS guidance for the last 7 years 77% of the time, same as Walmart, and better than Amazon. Fourth quarter earnings started to come in from other B&M retailers, and they were bombing. Holiday sales have become more and more of an issue for everyday B&M stores, in fact 50% of Targets missed earnings were from Q4's. Every time a B&M retailer would report their earnings and miss for q4 2016, Target would fall dramatically. Since Target reports later than many retailers, they took a beating before they even said a word. January 18 2017, they reported Nov/Dec sales numbers and updated their guidance.. Not a good sign for Q4 2016. Feb 28th, they report and its bad. Sales down and traffic down, the important things. They had some positives like 20% online growth, continual redcard membership growth, etc, but those are just sugar on the shit show that happened in Q4. This caused a MASSIVE 32% drop in 3 months.

So why buy Target? Because its undervalued based on the fear of other retailers that arent related and ONE bad quarter. Do you see Walmart dropping 10% from the failure of sears or JCP? Nope. The closest store to Target is Walmart, they do the same thing, the only difference is quality and price. Target isnt a mall store, it has less than 30 mall locations, it sells basic goods and food that people need daily, which kss, jcp, sears, etc dont sell. Target isnt going anywhere, Amazon physically cannot construct thousands of B&M stores in a reasonable time, they have less than 100 warehouses in the US, meaning they cant even offer 2 day delivery to most Americans, their 2 day shipping actually becomes 3-4 days since order to delivery (listed on amazon support page), and you can forget about same day delivery for 95%+ of their customers. Amazon has next to 0 penetration in essentials like toilet paper, and foods, as they have 2! services that have failed trying to bring that
to consumers (pantry, and fresh). And where do you think the baby boomers who are now watching their jcp, sears, etc close will go? Demographics say its certainly not online, and they have the money to spend to avoid going the the Walmart Zoo. Other retailers failing is actually GOOD for Target, Walmart, and Costco.

Target went from $78 to $55 in just 3 months. The last time it traded this low was in 2012. During premarket trading, people were buying shares at $59 after they reported earnings, but with the Trump drama the market pulled it back to a measly $55.
Target has continually increased their dividends every year, and it is currently at 4.30%. They will roll out 12 new exclusive house brands in the next 2 years, their previous launch of Cat and Jack (a kids clothing line) brought in $1 billion in sales.
In the Q4 report they said they would open up new smaller stores and cater to local markets, as these stores have been the most successful bring in double digit revenue increases over typical stores. They will continue to grow their online sales, will have same day delivery later this year
They also are putting time between them and the 'bathroom debacle' which led to a boycott. As most of us know, boycotts never last, and Americans are becoming more open to sexual and gender equality, which Target is a leader in.

During their Q1 earnings beat by a HUGE .30, they were blunt, and said we had a great quarter but there is no high fiving done here, we want to make every quarter this good, and not have another Q4 incident. So the company is clearly not going to sit back and hope for the best, they are going to
actively grow the brand and sales. In Q1 they also bought back 4.9 million shares at $61. Target also has programs they can easily cut to boost profits, for example Target gives 5% of its profits back to communities, which could be easily cut or reduced if needed.
Since Q4, 3 insiders have bought stock (with their own money, not receive stock options), one increasing his position from 6,431 to 16,431 (@$54=$548,600), and the other two spending another $500k combined @$57-59/share, indicating they expect the stock to increase above $60.

My price Target for Target is $60 before Q2, as investors continue to realize the sell off was too extreme and now its undervalued. I expect Target to beat earnings again by a more modest amount and see the stock hit $64. I would NOT hold shares into Q4, like I mentioned above Target struggles to beat Q4 expectations, so its not worth the risk.

Full disclosure, I do have shares in TGT. But it's silly to think I am trying to pump and dump a multi-billion dollar company on reddit.",2017-05-19,16,40

6561gv_TGT,TGT,Glad I rotated out of TGT and into SHOP this week...,"SHOP up nicely since I bought at $68. TGT doing nothing. I see this trend continuing for many years.

Brick and Mortar retail will be losing tens of billions in sales each year. The last 2 months alone 60,000 retail jobs have been lost. Malls are closing everywhere. I see no reason to invest in B&M retail. Online is the future and the potential is massive.

From this point forward online retail can grow about 500%.  B&M is lucky to shrink less than 10% a year.

I think SHOP has massive potential to ride this switch to online retail. SHOP is an amazing platform for any online merchant. Its valued at about $6B right now.  I can easily see it reach $50B in 5 years. In 10 years? $100B isn't out of the question.

The powerful thing about SHOP is they get a percentage of every sale made on their platform. So even if SHOP does not grow its customer base (they certainly will) just the increase in online sales alone will turbo boost their sales. But SHOP also integrates payment processing, marketing, delivery, inventory management and financing into their platform. And they will add more and more services each year. They could add accounting and tax services, analytics, social media tracking, ect. Amazing.

SHOP also gets a fee each month for businesses to use their platform. And we all know re-occuring revenue is the gold of businesses. Right now SHOP has about 400,000 customers.  There are about 50+ million businesses worldwide. You can see that SHOP has only scratched the surface of growth.

When you compare SHOP's business plan to AMZN its pretty obvious SHOP is light years ahead. AMZN looks antiquated.  AMZN has warehouses, inventory, and tons of workers. All risks that SHOP does not. SHOP was built from the ground up in the digital age. AMZN has some legacy components that slow it down. 

SHOP also offers business a totally customizable platform. AMZN's shops are generic and focus on the AMZN brand. If I was a merchant I would definitely build my store on SHOP's platform.

Basically what I'm saying is SHOP is an amazing opportunity at about $71 at a $6B valuation.  I know many are waiting for a 10% haircut, but that may not ever happen.  I can easily see SHOP reach a $100B valuation in 10 years. That is a 1500% return.  Invest $10k in SHOP today and it could be worth $150,000 in 10 years.

Disclosure: I own SHOP shares. Currently its my 2nd largest holding at 7% of my portfolio. I also own TGT shares. Which is less than 1% of my portfolio and is a short-term hold.",2017-04-13,0,10

5youpz_TGT,TGT,"My stock picks this week: TGT, GILD, TWTR","Loaded up on these stocks today. Its getting really hard to find good stocks to invest in with so many all time highs.

TGT - bought more at $55. P/E of 9.8.  Forward P/E of 14.  Forward P/E does not look to great until you realize 2017 is an investment year. They will sacrifice short-term profits for long-term profits. They will invest billions on store remodels, new smaller stores, and online.

In 2018 I'm estimating 7% revenue growth and 8% profit growth. At that point the dividend yield will be 4.5%-4.75%  based on $55 price and 2 dividend raises. Price target for 2018 is $70. 

GILD - Bought at $67.50. Another stock beaten to death because of a weak 2017 forecast. 6.8 P/E and 3% dividend. My price target for 2018 is $100. 

TWTR - Bought at $15. I admit this is a moonshot. I don't see this dropping much more from here. If it does it will be a prime acquisition target and you will probably get close to $15 per share anyway. But I do see massive upside. Twitter is still a powerful platform with hundreds of millions of users. Users who engage with it every day, multiple times a day. 

Monetization and data mining is the key. Even with just a slight bump in these the stock can easily see $30 in 2018.",2017-03-10,0,2
5y9fkc_TGT,TGT,NYSE:TGT - Reached the bottom? Is it a longterm buy?,"Hi All

I have been following $NYSE:TGT lately and it seems like due to their earnings report and 2017 outlook the stock got hammered hard. Do you think it is worth investing in target at these prices ($55) for people who are looking for long term divident (growth) payers with a potential upside?",2017-03-08,1,12
5y2mgq_TGT,TGT,"When will WMT, TGT, COST, ect Fight back against Amazon?","I mean seriously. Will these retailers just keep their heads in the sand and allow Amazon to steal their lunch, dinner, and breakfast?

The strategy is simple. Come close to matching Amazon's online experience and trump them with your physical stores. The combination of an strong online platform AND physicals stores is the key.

Sure Walmart and Costco have decent online store fronts. But what makes Amazon better boils down to one thing: selection. Costco, Walmart, ect can match Amazon on price. But they have limited selection. So how to solve the problem?

Walmart, Costco, Target, Home Depot, ect all need to combine forces to battle Amazon. Imagine if there was ONE website you could login to. With ONE credit card and ONE account. From that site you can order stuff from Costco, Target, Home Depot, Walmart, ect. The selection available would blow away Amazon. Shipping and fulfillment would blow away Amazon because combined those retailers have a much bigger reach.

Will they do it?  The problem is PRIDE. Walmart, Costco, ect think they can do it on their own and they want to own the customer data/relationship online. But they are making a stupid mistake. Only by combining their inventories, physical stores, and distribution network can they compete with Amazon long-term.",2017-03-07,0,29

Sure AMZN could try to build physical stores itself. But why do that when you can buy TGT at a massive discount and pay with Amazon shares?

Throw in a 4% dividend rate, about $3 billion in profits, and the authorization to buy 15% of its stock.

IMO, this is an amazing opportunity to get in near the bottom. You will probably need to hold for 12-18 months but I can easily see this stock go up 50-100% in that time frame.",2017-03-02,93,130
5wniwr_TGT,TGT,Target (TGT) With a Seriously Ugly Quarter,"Misses by 6c on EPS and $50M on rev, but where the ugly really kicks in:

Sees FY EPS of $3.80 to $4.20 vs $5.34 EST. Next quarter guidance (.80c-$1.00; estimates were at $1.33) is also nowhere near estimates. Saying guidance is due to impact of company's transition to a new financial model (wtf?), the details of which will be announced later today.

CNBC now talking about the kind of guidance and discussion Target offered at last year's meeting and that the results are nowhere close.

5qc5vb_QCOM,QCOM,NYSE:TGT or NASDAQ:QCOM,"Both are nice divident growth companies with a not so high payout ratio: Target 57%, Qualcomm 51% and both have doubled their dividend payout in the last 5 years. 

Is it worth to buy any of the above companies now? For TGT I read a lot of articles where people are bullish about the stock as it can increase its online sales and the recent bad reports do not mean much. 

As for QCOM I guess that they will not need to pay 1 billion to Apple, most of these cases get settled.

What do you think, which of the above companies would be better to own for the next 5-10 years?

I'm bearish on the company. But I think nowadays it can take a long time for bad stuff to show up in ER because accountants are turning into wizards. 

TGT has a long history of increasing dividends. So if they stop doing that, it would be a big negative with all the long time holders who have been enjoying dividend increases every-year. I think they might have some cash worries in the short-term. But I'm just guessing.
