1k1jq5a_UPS,UPS,Tilray Reverse Split Vote Destined to Fail,"I don't think their reverse split proposal will pass. The vast majority of shareholders are retail and everyone is fed up with Simon and management at the moment.

The stock has the ability to regain compliance on it's own with a good Q4 which has always been our strongest quarter or a catalyst with regards to US rescheduling or the Canadian excise tax. And even if it doesn't we have plenty to time with 160 day initial period and then an extension. I think management needs to see that the shareholders are not okay with issuing more shares even if we do believe in the company. A no vote will send a strong message to management and specifically Simon.

I am not familiar with what threshold they would need to pass this proposal, I'm guessing 50% with one third of all shareholders voting? ",2025-04-17,57,72
1jlwu4t_MAR,MAR,Aphria (Tilray) class action lawsuit settlement,"
I was surprised to find that there wasn't much info in this subreddit on the Aphria (now Tilray) class action lawsuit settlement. 

See this Yahoo Finance article for a summary: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-purchase-shares-aphria-inc-130000308.html 

See the official class action lawsuit website for details: https://www.aphriasettlement.com/  

Basically if you bought shares after Jan 29, 2018 and held them until either Mar 23 or Dec 3 2018, you may be entitled to part of the $30M settlement. I for one bought 1,100 shares during the eligible period.  

I called the claim hotline and was told that the settlement approval hearing will take place on March 26, and an update will be posted on the lawsuit website shortly after that. That should include details on how to submit a claim. So stay tuned former Aphria holders!

If anyone has any additional info on the lawsuit feel free to share!",2025-03-28,8,4

Current political environment - idgaf which side you’re on let’s look at this objectively. Trump has changed his stance and views on weed, particularly because those close to him ( Barron trump, trump jr, celebrities , etc..) are all pro decriminalization. Who would’ve thought trump was going to appear at a Theo von podcast or Joe Rogan??  We live in unpredictable times with an unpredictable president. Times are changing and let’s  be honest, any penny stock is all about speculating and it’s a straight gamble. This is a gamble BUT the current political landscape favors this particular industry, increasing your chances for prosperity. 

Robert F Kennedy JR AKA. Mr. Secretary of health and human services who has stated before that he is radical transparencist and if research proofs that certain substances (legal or not legal) do in fact show improvement in the target audience , then he will legalize. There are numerous research studies that At a low dosage , cannabis use can in fact treat anxiety and depression. Can you imagine if this is legalized and given to the VA to treat PTSD?? 

Not to mention if something like this were to be drafted, it will have unconditional bi partisan support. 

Socially, support has been steadily increasing for legalization. 

Internationally, countries in Europe and Asia are taking a more positive and pro approach. 

I am telling you, if you have $5,$10,$50 $2 , whatever… this is the stock to watch and invest. And no, I am not high at the moment of writing this. I don’t smoke but only smoke on very rare occasions BUT if it was legal, I will feel more comfortable smoking.

This is not investment advice, just an analysis from a retail investor. lol. Cheers everyone. 

For every upvote within 72 hours, I will invest $1 into this stock. That’s how bullish I am. Will post pic.

They specifically stated: The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program, if any, to **fund strategic and accretive acquisitions or investments in businesses, including potential acquisitions of assets in the U.S. and internationally** in order to capitalize on expected regulatory advancements or expansion opportunities. The Company **does not currently intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program for general working capital purposes.**

Here is the recent 10-Q they filed for recent quarter financials: [https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/b692ab74-dfa4-47e1-bde5-51132a653862](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/b692ab74-dfa4-47e1-bde5-51132a653862)

**During the six months ended November 30, 2024**, the Company issued the following shares of Common Stock: a) **67,210,864 shares of Common Stock pursuant to its At-the-Market (“ATM”) program, which generated gross proceeds of $114,342 and net proceeds of $111,516**, after deducting $2,826 in commissions and other fees associated with these issuances.

**From December 2, 2024 to December 11, 2024**, the Company **issued an additional 8,351,253 shares in connection with the Company’s ATM Program, thereby generating gross proceeds of $11,064. The Company netted proceeds of $10,843** after commissions and other fees associated with these issuances in the amount of $221.

Since the ATM program started, Tilray only made 1 acquisition. This was the purchase of 4 craft breweries from Molson/Coors. [https://tilray.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-brands-acquire-four-craft-beer-breweries-molson-coors](https://tilray.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-brands-acquire-four-craft-beer-breweries-molson-coors) \- from their previous 10-Q: Effective September 1, 2024, the Company acquired four craft beer brands and breweries from Molson Coors Beverage Company (""Molson"") including Atwater Brewery, Hop Valley Brewing Company, Terrapin Beer Co., and Revolver Brewing for a total purchase consideration of **$23,079**.

**Since the ATM program started they tapped into $122M and only used $23M of it for an acquisition.  So where did the rest of the $69M go?**

The only way I can make sense of it is with their marketable securities. They purchased $30M this quarter and $43M the previous quarter. This is a possible explanation of where the ATM funds went and marketable securities is technically cash provided by investment activities (which can be stretched to investment in businesses).

However that doesn't make sense as they stated: the Company continues to invest our excess cash in the **short-term in marketable securities which are comprised of U.S. treasury bills and term deposits with major Canadian, European and Australian banks.** So these investments would not qualify under their ATM definition of how it can be used. Also the amount of MS went down quarter over quarter from $74M to $62M so a good chunk has been disposed and went back into the company.

1hykfug_NET,NET,TLRY vs GTBIF vs MJ Industry,"There is a lot of commentary, and disappointment, about TLRY's recent earnings, TLRY share price, and the MJ Industry as a whole. Here are my thoughts, for whatever it's worth.

MJ stocks will likely not increase until there is a major industry-wide catalyst. Two of which I potentially see over the next 1-2 years are rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III in the US and mergers/partnership/acquisitions with larger non MJ companies. The latter meaning the MJ industry starts to partner with big pharma (Merck/Pfizer) and/or big beverage companies (Coke/Pepsi/Budweiser).

Take a look at Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF) recent earnings report, from November 7, 2024:
-3Q GAAP net income of $9 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share.
-3Q adjusted EBITDA of $89 million (31% of revenue).
-Nine months cash flow from operations of $152 million, net of $88 million of tax payments.
-Retired $225 million senior debt, due 4/30/25.
-Authorized $50 million for the repurchase of Subordinate Voting Shares from September 23, 2024 to September 22, 2025.

Since the earnings report the stock has dropped from $10.70/share to $7.39/share.  This is a 31% decline in two months, after reporting solid earnings and a stock repurchase plan. 

While TLRY's earnings remain weak, there is some excitement around international cannabis sales and infused beverages in the US, Canada, etc. The company is making progress, but faces significant headwinds on taxes, regulations, competition, etc. 

My point in comparing the two stocks, it is my belief, that no matter how solid earnings are, until a major catalyst for the industry happens, individual company performance will not be appropriately rewarded. My hope is that at least one catalyst occurs in 2025, with rescheduling in the US as the most likely, in my personal opinion. Once that happens, it should open up other catalysts, including SAFE banking, partnerships/mergers/acquisitions, investment inflows from institutions and hedge funds (who are largely not allowed to invest in MJ stocks since the product remains illegal at the federal level). TLRY, GTBIF, and all other MJ stocks will likely not be able to sustain any reasonable long-term rally until a major catalyst occurs.

May we all pray to the MJ Gods for rescheduling to occur this year. Then....we can moon. 

Holding 20,000+ TLRY shares long. This is only my personal opinion and is not considered investment advice. Please do your own due diligence. ",2025-01-11,52,71

1hg18m6_TLRY,TLRY,TLRY WEED+CRAFTBEER,"Looking into the comany, Tilray Brands, Inc. (TLRY). I read a post last week and draw my attention to TLRY. The ticker, TLRY, rings my bell, I vaguely remember TLRY becoz of their IPO in 2018. TLRY soared after IPO, but I missed it. Simple reason, just becoz I don't smoke. 

After looking up some information, TLRY the first cannabis company to go public on Nasdaq. It implied they are one of the very first one in the industry. Since TLRY is a Canadian company, Canada is the first G7 member to legalize recreational cannabis. So, TLRY seems like a early player in a early player country. However, I don't understand why TLRY got beat down so hard. 

Besides cannabis, TLRY also bought up some craftbeer brand in the US. I knew Miller, Budweiser and Coors...are big. I knew people, esp like my dad generation kind of stick with those brand, but I noticed beer drinker is no longer drinking the households brand only. Although, my dad is still drinking his Miller.

1ggrbds_TLRY,TLRY,[MSOS/TLRY/CGC] DEA's ALJ hearing on cannabis rescheduling is delayed until January,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/dea-marijuana-rescheduling-hearing-delayed-until-2025-agency-judge-rules/


""The Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) hearing on the Biden administration’s marijuana rescheduling proposal is being delayed until 2025, Marijuana Moment has learned.""

""After DEA Administrator Anne Millgram signed off on over two dozen witnesses to participate in the hearing on Monday, Chief Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) John Mulrooney issued a preliminary order on Thursday signaling that the information provided on those set to testify was insufficient and requesting additional details and potential availability for a formal hearing in January or February 2025.""

""When the Justice Department proposed moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III in March following a scientific review, advocates and stakeholders had hoped the rule would be finalized this year. And DEA did schedule the hearing for December 2—after the presidential election but before the January inauguration that will see an administrative changeup.""

**""Now the latest order from Mulrooney clarifies that won’t be the case.""**

**""The reason being is that DEA’s list of hearing participants who were selected and sent to the ALJ’s office provided “no indication in the four corners of the document as to whether the ‘participants’ support or oppose the [notice of proposed rulemaking] or how the ‘participants’ satisfy the ‘interested person’ definition set forth in the regulations,” the judge’s order says.""**

**“Indeed, the [Participant Letter] contains only a list of persons and organizations accompanied by one or more email addresses, without the benefit of notices of appearance, addresses, or even phone numbers,” it says.**

""**The order from the DEA ALJ says that selected participants must provide such details by November 12**. DEA is mandated to provide “its counsel(s) of record who will be appearing in these proceedings, as well as any known conflicts of interest that may require disclosure” on the same date.""


""Here’s the list of witnesses that DEA selected:""

-Counsel for the Government

-Village Farms International

-National Cannabis Industry Association

-American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine

-Cannabis Bioscience International 
Holdings Hemp for Victory

-State of Connecticut

-Massachusetts Cannabis Advisory Board

-Veterans Initiative 22

-The Doc App. Dba, My Florida Green

-The Commonwealth Project

-Saint Michael’s College

-International Association of Chiefs of Police

-Drug Enforcement Association of Federal Narcotics Agents

-American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine

-Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America

-Tennessee Bureau of Investigation

-National Sheriff’s Association

**""An initial hearing will still take place on December 2, but the judge said no testimony or evidence will be taken at the tame.""**

“Designated Participants who will participate will come prepared with January-February 2025 availability dates regarding their counsel and any witness such [designated participants] will seek to present at the hearing on the merits,” he said. “Dates for the hearing on the merits and other deadlines will be fixed in a prehearing ruling, which will be issued after the preliminary hearing where the parties have been afforded the opportunity to supply logistical and availability input.”


...I honestly don't know what to think, besides thinking that this gross display of incompetence is just ridiculous. While also not ruling out the possibility of sabotage, although I can only speculate now.

Either way, at least now we know who are the participants taking part on the hearings, the list is seems to be even at both sides, but I don't know enough about the participants to be 100% sure.

This explains the massive sell off on the sector that happened early this week, which I can only assume it will resume even further tomorrow and on the following weeks.

Regardless, I'm not selling now, not after so fucking long and not after being down so much.

1gfjqx5_TLRY,TLRY,[MSOS/TLRY/CGC] The DEA begins calling witnesses for cannabis rescheduling ALJ hearing: Stakeholders and prohibitionists are invited so far.,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/dea-begins-selecting-witnesses-for-marijuana-rescheduling-hearing-inviting-industry-stakeholders-and-prohibitionists-to-testify/

""The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has started selecting witnesses to participate in a much-anticipated hearing on the Biden administration’s proposal to federally reschedule marijuana that’s scheduled for December, Marijuana Moment has learned.""

""This comes about seven months after the Justice Department formally proposed moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) following a scientific review. After a public comment period, which saw tens of thousands of people weigh in on the issue, a hearing was set for December 2 to gather additional expert input.""

**""The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) is among those that received a notice from DEA this week that their request to participate in the hearing has been granted.""**

**""A source familiar with the administrative proceedings told Marijuana Moment that anti-cannabis groups Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) and National Drug & Alcohol Screening Association (NDASA) have also received notices granting their requests.""**

""It’s not clear how many witnesses DEA selected of the many who submitted requests ahead of the hearing, nor it is apparent whether the agency plans to continue granting requests on a rolling basis in the coming weeks. Representatives of major pro-marijuana organizations such as NORML and the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) said they have not yet received a response on their requests to participate as of Tuesday afternoon.""

So the presence of two major anti-marijuana groups were already expected, the DEA will have to hear both sides of the aisle in the matter, but it feels odd that they invited anti-marijuana groups but so far, did not invited any pro-marijuana group besides major stakeholders in the industry.

Regardless, out of all the comments that were sent to the DEA a month ago, the amount of positive comments to rescheduling the plant completely dwarfed the negatives, and the invitation process is just beginning anyway, so I can assume that more people and groups will be invited.

Either way, I do not expect this rescheduling process to be over this year, given that the ALJ will only happen in December, even if it, it would only be  in efeect in 2025 anyway.

1ge5qjx_TLRY,TLRY,"[MSOS/TLRY/CGC] As the DEA ponders rescheduling cannabis, a record number of banks are starting to work with cannabis companies.","https://www.marijuanamoment.net/a-record-number-of-banks-are-working-with-marijuana-businesses-as-rescheduling-looms-new-federal-data-shows/

""A record number of banks are now reporting that they’re working with state-legal marijuana businesses amid increased pressure on Congress to enact broader protections for financial institutions interested in servicing the cannabis industry and as the Biden administration’s rescheduling proposal advances, new federal data shows.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has been tracking cannabis banking trends for the past decade, and its latest report for the second quarter of 2024 shows a record high, with 831 banks and credit unions reporting their active involvement with marijuana companies.

That’s up from 815 in the first quarter of 2024 and 799 in the prior quarter.

There are several possible factors that could help explain the increase in banks working with cannabis businesses, including the expansion of state marijuana markets as more legalization laws have taken effect over time. It’s also possible financial institutions are more willing to navigate the space as congressional lawmakers across the aisle continue to discuss their shared interest in advancing codified protections for banks under the Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act.

That legislation cleared a Senate committee last year, but it’s still pending floor action. With limited time left this session—and competing legislative priorities during an election year—the chances that it moves through the Senate and GOP-controlled House this year are unclear at best, however.""

It's an interesting development to see now that there are banking institutions willing to work with cannabis companies, even though SAFER hasn't been passed through Congress yet, it tells us that some banks are willing to take the risk of working with these companies even though cannabis remains federally illegal, maybe it could be a sign that banks are seeing the sector favorably to make businesses with in the future.

1g2u6cj_UPS,UPS,Tilray's Craft beer/spirits business - the reality of the situation,"To start, this is not meant to persuade people to buy or sell stock in Tilray. My purpose is to inform the sub as to what happened and is happening so investors can make informed decisions. I see lots of romanticized ideas as to what the grand plan is, which most are misguided. Hopefully this post enlightens and continues a discussion that is based on facts and what is the most likely scenario(s) that will play out

**The Back Story:**

Tilray (Aphria) under Irwin's leadership have made some significant acquisitions in the craft beer/spirits business. Most notably:

1. \[Acquisition of SweetWater Brewing Co for $300M USD\](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-805484407.html)
2. \[Acquisition of Breckenridge Distillery for $100M USD\](https://www.distillerytrail.com/blog/breckenridge-distillery-the-worlds-highest-distillery-acquired-by-canadian-cannabis-company-tilray-for-102-9-million/)
3. \[Acquiring 8 beer brands from AB for $85M USD\](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731348/000143774923022325/ex\_548126.htm)
4. \[Recently acquiring 4 beer brands from Molson/Coors for $23M USD\](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-brands-completes-acquisition-craft-beer-brands-and)

I believe there were a few smaller acquisitions in there but those are the main ones. Tilray has spent approximately $500M+ USD to get into the distillery/craft beer business. That is a significant amount of capital to put into this venture that can't be ignored

**Tilray does not care about craft beer or spirits**

There are 2 actions that occurred that should illustrate this point

**1. The firing of Tonya Cornett and her team**

A name that probably nobody knows (I didn't either until recently). However she is arguably one of the best craft brewers in the world. She has won numerous awards and pioneered craft beer. She was employed by 10 Barrel Brewing with a very impressive team that formed their innovation group. In April 2024, this team went to the World Beer Cup and made history sweeping an entire category with gold. Something that has never been done before.

\[Tilray fired the entire team last month.\](https://newschoolbeer.com/home/2024/9/tilray-lays-off-10-barrel-brewings-entire-innovation-brewing-team) It is hard to say that you want to infuse life and create winning brands when you gut the people that give you the ability to do that

**2. The volume of acquisitions in the space**

Without doxxing myself, I work corporate development for a publicly traded company. We are extremely active in M&A. We have bought declining/distressed companies in the past and continue to look for opportunities. From my experience, its a lot of work to turn a declining company around. They need attention, money and effort to stop revenue decline and attract old and new customers to the brand. Our last declining business took 18 months to stabilize, right size and integrate the business to where we had envisioned it. The operational folks worked a lot to get it to where it was an asset to us and not a drag on financials.

Tilray bought 12 of them, all under 2 years time. There is absolutely no way they have enough resources to stabilize all of them. You simply can't. \[Also the craft beer industry is in decline, so why would you inject resources into a declining industry?\](https://robbreport.com/food-drink/dining/craft-beer-slowdown-bars-cutting-back-1235491542/)

**What the craft beer/distillery revenue will look like over time**

The \[previous article I mentioned\](https://newschoolbeer.com/home/2024/9/tilray-lays-off-10-barrel-brewings-entire-innovation-brewing-team) will give insight to where that revenue and business is going. Most notably this sentence: This included company wide positions in brewing, admin, and sales, which has been confirmed by multiple sources.

Tilray is going into every brand and firing brewing, admin, and sales staff to try and bring the company to either being profitable and a little more profitable. The side effect of this is that most likely all these brands will continue to decline and get worse, not better. Think about it:

* If you have 10 sales people and you fire 4 of them, how would sales go up with less people
* How would les admin staff improve customer service, invoicing/billing, etc
* How would less brewers make better products to attract and retain customers

Not to mention the intangibles. Imagine your company gets bought out, the new owner fires a bunch of people you enjoyed working with, and now you have to do more work to pick up the slack for the same pay. Moral is awful when this happens and people don't go the extra mile to help the company at all.

So the most likely scenario is revenue will continue to decline for a bit until they stabilize. They will do so by drastically pulling back on products and probably end up with only 3-4 brands that they can actually manage and that show potential. They will keep the illusion up of lots of brands. For example they'll have a coffee beer that in one area is called coffee, another is called java and a third called cup of Joe (all under different brands/labels) - but in reality it'll be the same beer in the can. Revenue will land far smaller in the future then what it was when they acquired it

**So what is the future and why did they make these moves?**

I can articulate this but u/Geologic23 already made a comment that I think summarizes very well what the carrot that Tilray is chasing - [https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/1g1uixu/comment/lrmoyz5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/1g1uixu/comment/lrmoyz5/)

So the question investors need to understand is will spending a bunch of money now on bleeding businesses be worth it in the future when they transition over the hemp beverages? These businesses will continue to bleed and Tilray will do the best they can too stabilize or minimize the damage. They will also go through a transition where they scale back beer and replace with THC seltzers and such. Will future THC beverage sales compensate for the drag on financials that has and will continue to happen in the alcohol sales. 

Also want to add that it is not as simple as ""yeah of course this will work, because they will make money and grow so its all good"". When you use a DCF model future revenue is worth far less that today's revenue (especially if you go out 3+ years. So the longer it takes the bigger the boom needs to be to make it worthwhile for today's shareholders.

Last thing, there is upside to this strategy but there are also lots of risks as well (political, market, competitor and operational). I'm not going to get into those now as this post is not about whether this is good or bad, but what they did and why they are doing it. I'm sure the comment section will dive into the good or bad discussion organically.

Tilray cultivates and sells cannabis in Canada and exports into the global medical market. It also sells CBD and alcohol. The company is the result of legacy Aphria acquiring legacy Tilray in a reverse merger and taking the target name in 2021. Canada legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018. Since then, recreational sales have come to represent an increasingly larger portion of sales for producers. The Canadian market is crowded with producers, so Tilray faces stiff competition to develop consumer brands that can lead to meaningful pricing power. In June 2023, Tilray acquired Hexo, which helped drive necessary market consolidation, but Canada remains overcrowded. We forecast mid-single-digit organic growth over the next 10 years for Tilray's Canadian cannabis business, mostly from adult use. The international medical market, which accounted for 14% of Tilray's fiscal 2024 gross cannabis revenue, is more attractive and profitable, as strict regulations limit the number of competitors. Exporters must pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants. We forecast low-double-digit growth over the next 10 years as more medical cannabis legalization expands to new markets, like Germany has begun in 2024. In 2020, legacy Aphria acquired SweetWater, a US craft brewer, and has since made additional acquisitions to grow its alcohol business, which now accounts for about 23% of companywide gross revenue. We forecast midsingle-digit growth over the next 10 years. However, we see little synergies across Tilray's portfolio of cannabis, alcoholic beverages, and wellness products as the markets, distribution systems, and regulatory systems are vastly different

Tilray has limited US THC exposure. Management believes that if cannabis were descheduled, then Tilray could export into the US medical market from its Canadian production given its GMP certification. We’re skeptical this strategy could generate much success, as we don’t think Tilray has any advantage getting its products on US dispensary shelves, many of which are owned by multistate operators. 

**Bulls Say Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024**  

Tilray's better financial health and profitability lead compared with Canadian peers positions it to lead its home market.  

Tilray's management focuses on strategic SG&A spending and running a lean business model, benefiting its financial health in the early growth stage industry.  

Tilray management's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach EBITDA profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers. It'll reach positive free cash flow before them, too. 

**Bears Say Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024**  

The existence of the illicit market limits the potential price increases Tilray can push through to consumers. 

Governments are incentivized to maximize tax revenue for products like alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis. Although alcohol and tobacco companies successfully pass higher taxes onto consumers, cannabis companies lack the brand power to do the same. 

Tilray has a history of diluting existing shareholders when it needs capital, and the risk of that remains. 

**Fair Value and Profit Drivers Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024** 

After updating our model for fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, we've maintained our fair value estimate of $2 per share for Tilray. We forecast CAGR for net revenue from cannabis to be roughly 7% through fiscal 2034. Our forecast is based on moderate price increases of roughly 2% per year. Most of the top line growth is based on higher volumes from the growing size of the legal market for the Canadian and international medical markets. For Tilray's alcohol business, we forecast roughly 6% annual revenue growth over the next decade, and long-term gross margins to remain steady in the mid-40% range, as contributions from lower margin beer brands weigh on expansion. We expect the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin to expand from 8% in fiscal 2024 to 26% in fiscal 2034. This is mostly due to fixed cost leverage against overhead expenses and wider gross margins for the cannabis business. We forecast the company will generate consistent positive free cash flow to the firm in fiscal 2028, a few years later than management's target of 2025. We forecast capital expenditures averaging 3% of net revenue through our 10-year forecast period. We assume a cost of equity of 9%, reflecting medium cyclicality of revenue, our forecast 20% operating margin, and low operating and financial leverage. Our fair value estimate does not include any specific ESG risk, as we do not see any with high enough probability for inclusion within our base case.

Captured within our uncertainty rating, as societal acceptance, usage, and legality continues to widen, we estimate cannabis faces a 25%-49% probability of seeing higher taxes. We estimate materiality of 25%-49%, as we see producers may struggle to pass on all higher taxes to the end-customer. This risk is offset by customers switching to the illicit market, preventing overly aggressive taxing in the legal market. We also note five additional ESG risks. First, we see a potential ESG risk related to the environmental and social impact of the company’s products and services if the trend of widening societal and legal acceptance reversed. We see less than 10% probability of this occurring, but the impact could be in the 25%-49% range given the likely impact on legal sales. Second, for carbon from own operations, we see risk of increased regulation for indoor production and its high electricity usage. Using lamps to provide artificial sunlight and cooling to offset the heat generated by the lamps, the carbon footprint of indoor production is sizable. However, we estimate just 10%-24% probability of occurring and 10%-24% materiality, as any regulation or increased cost would likely shift production outdoors. Third, for outdoor production, we see potential ESG risk around land use and biodiversity. Like all agricultural crops, there is a risk for damage to the natural environment they’re grown in, particularly if fertilizers, pesticides, or other chemicals are used. However, we see just 10%-24% probability and less than 10% materiality. Furthermore, we don’t think increased environmental costs would be enough to erode the cost advantage of outdoor production. The fourth and fifth ESG risks center around product governance for cannabis. First, manufacturing irregularities could potentially cause adverse consequences after consumption. We see less than 10% probability of this risk materializing, as regulations require significant testing before products make it to a dispensary shelf. Still, we estimate the risk to have 10%-24% materiality, as a crisis could drive slower growth and increased regulatory costs. Finally, increased regulation on adverse health effects could lead to slower growth or higher costs. However, we see probability as less than 10%. Health impacts are largely understood and accepted by a consumer, at least anecdotally. We think scientific studies are more likely to disprove myths about cannabis’ dangers rather than find new health effects. Still, the risk is somewhat material at 10%-24% as it would likely hurt consumer usage.

**Economic Moat Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 9 Apr 2024** 

We assign Tilray a no-moat rating. Although the intangible assets and cost advantage moat sources could gradually develop over time, we see several barriers that prevent Tilray from earning an economic moat for the time being. Although our base-case scenario assumes that Tilray will achieve economic profit generation by the end of our 10-year explicit forecast period, the probability of material value destruction for stakeholders currently remains too high to assign anything other than a no-moat rating. We believe the most likely moat source would come in the form of intangible assets stemming from regulation or brand development. Cultivators and dispensaries require government licenses to operate in every market where cannabis is legalized in some form. As a result, companies with licenses could potentially be protected from outside competition, helping establish pricing power. However, a regulation intangible only exists if governments issue a limited number of licenses in order to not imbalance supply and demand for cannabis. For example, Oregon issued too many cultivation licenses upon recreational legalization, leading to significant oversupply and very low selling prices. When too many licenses are issued, the power of each individual license is weakened. A low selling price also reduces tax revenue collected by governments, which creates a disincentive for states to overissue licenses. We believe it is unlikely that governments would significantly overissue licenses as Oregon’s mistake has served as a lesson for regulators to have a more deliberate pace in license issuance. This same risk exists for dispensaries if too many dispensary licenses are issued relative to demand. The creation of brand-driven intangible assets could help cannabis companies establish pricing power and generate economic profits. For comparison, alcohol and cigarettes are typically highly taxed, but producers of these products have established strong enough differentiation and brand intangibles that consumers are willing to pay price premiums. Although Tilray and its competitors are attempting to establish brand equity, we see the creation of the intangible asset moat source within the next decade as unlikely since the industry remains in a very early stage. Health Canada regulates the packaging of cannabis products in a very strict manner. It requires cannabis packaging to be plain with many restrictions on logos, colors, images, and branding. Health Canada’s requirements are designed to reduce the appeal of cannabis products, especially for people under the legal age. The regulations are also intended to make the health warning messages on the products more prominent than a cannabis company’s brand. Additionally, Canadian regulation prevents direct contact between cannabis companies and “budtenders,"" dispensary workers who provide expert advice and help consumers select their cannabis. Advertising is possible in venues in which only adults will be present, but we think Canada’s limitations produce meaningful barriers to brand creation. We believe the process of purchasing cannabis is comparable to that of selecting wine, in which the choice is made on type rather than brand. As consumers can find many similar cannabis products across various dispensaries, cannabis companies will also have to differentiate their products from their competitors and establish brand equity in order to potentially create brand intangibles in the future. As cannabis shifts from its traditional smoking form to infused drinks and food products, there may be the potential for the creation of brand intangibles. However, we think the development and widespread distribution of regulatory-approved infused products will take too long for a potential brand intangible to drive excess returns within the next decade. In addition, fierce competition is likely to drive the need for greater investment into brand building, weighing on returns. The key to a brand intangible is its ability to command premium pricing and in turn deliver economic profits. At this point, we believe cannabis market share may be more reflective of distribution rather than brand, especially as the slow rollout of cannabis in Canada hinders growth. We think that brand power may strengthen eventually, but we think it is highly unlikely that any brand will be strong enough in the next 10 years to command pricing power 

Tilray does not have exposure to the US THC cannabis market due to federal prohibition. However, once US federal regulations are changed and interstate trade is permitted, there will be intense competition in the cannabis market as companies attempt to establish and strengthen their brands. This would create a highly competitive environment that would likely limit the potential return on marketing spend for any single brand. While typical consumer products companies, and even tobacco companies earlier in their history, have built brand recognition through advertising campaigns, we expect cannabis will face the same, if not stricter, advertising limitations to tobacco in the United States. We believe this makes it even harder for cannabis companies to build a recognizable brand, as opportunities to address the consumer will be limited. Under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, tobacco product advertising faces restrictions, including outdoor advertising near schools and playgrounds, sports and entertainment brand sponsorships, and point-ofsale advertising. Advertising on television and radio has been banned since 1971 by the FCC. Although tobacco companies spend roughly $10 billion on marketing in the US, roughly two thirds is spent on price discounts to reduce the cost of cigarettes to consumers. While this may help tobacco companies protect existing brand intangibles with its customers, we don’t think the same strategy could build a new brand intangible in cannabis. We think that it would be unlikely for Tilray to establish a cost advantage. Due to the climate, most cannabis in Canada is grown in greenhouses or indoors. Although this allows for higher quality cannabis to be grown, these methods are much more expensive given the required lighting (for indoor cultivation) and climate control. Additionally, advantages in greenhouse and indoor cultivation can be much more easily imitated than geographic advantages that are present in outdoor cultivation. For example, cannabis grown in the Western US in states like Oregon is grown outdoors. Without the need for as much equipment, costs are significantly lower, partially offset by fewer harvests and lower quality. Furthermore, labor is the single largest cost of production for any growing method. Countries such as Jamaica, Paraguay, and Colombia have less expensive labor costs along with fertile soil and have expressed a desire to establish a medical cannabis industry. These countries are likely to produce at lower costs than any US or Canadian cultivators. There are several challenges to economic profit. First, given that the cannabis industry remains in the growth stage, we think that years of significant investment will be necessary to support robust growth for the industry. An extended capital expansion cycle through the next several years means that companies will be unlikely to generate economic profits in excess of their costs of capital for quite some time. Second, we see governments and the illicit market squeezing cannabis cultivators and dispensaries and thus preventing excess economic profit generation. With governments on national, state, and local levels reeling from budget problems and emergency expenses from covid-19, the emergence of cannabis as a legal product has come to be viewed as a funding panacea. For example, Washington has implemented a 37% tax rate on recreational cannabis. We see this as early evidence that governments, with full control over licensing, will attempt to maximize their economics. All else equal, consumers would likely bear any government tax increase, as we’ve observed in the cigarette market. However, we believe the existence of a large and accessible illicit market effectively serves as a price ceiling regarding what consumers are willing to pay. For example, when California legalized recreational cannabis with a relatively high tax, the legal market shrank as consumers returned to the illicit market. We see companies like Tilray, involved in the cultivation and selling of cannabis, as having the least leverage against both the government and consumers.

**Risk and Uncertainty Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024** 

As a cannabis producer, Tilray faces numerous risks, largely around regulation, leading to our Very High Uncertainty Rating. The largest risk is the pace and status of legalization. Tilray’s home market of Canada legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018. However, the pace of dispensary rollouts and permissible products started very slow. As a result, legal cannabis demand was bottlenecked by the pace of expansion. Currently, the major challenge is overcompetition, as there are far too many licensed producers for the current size of the legal market, as well as a persistent illicit market. Tilray does not have direct exposure to the US THC cannabis market. Also, legacy Aphria acquired SweetWater, a US craft brewery and legacy Tilray acquired Manitoba Harvest, a US CBD producer. Although there is growing public support, legalization is politically divisive with most Republican support coming only in the form of states’ rights. Another risk is the illicit market. Years of government efforts have done little to stem illegal cannabis, but a change to the ease of accessing illicit supply could have a significant impact on the pricing power and thus the profitability of legal cannabis companies. In addition to the operational risks, Tilray also faces meaningful financial risk. It has yet to generate positive free cash flow, so may need to access capital markets for funding. Tilray’s biggest environmental, social, and governance risks are around higher taxes and increased regulation, societal and legal acceptance, environmental impacts during growing, and product effects. Higher taxes and increased regulation are the most probable and included in our bear case. Additional risks around environmental impact, a reversal in still-growing acceptance, and product safety are notable but neither probable nor material enough to be included explicitly in our forecasts or affect our uncertainty rating.

**Financial Strength Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024** 

At the end of its fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Tilray had about $388 million in total debt, excluding lease liabilities. This compares to market capitalization of about $1.6 billion. In addition, Tilray had about $228 million in cash and $32 million in marketable securities. Management has been deliberate with its SG&A spending given the slow rollouts and regulatory challenges the Canadian market has faced. Legacy Aphria was the first major Canadian producer to reach positive EBITDA, with legacy Tilray reaching positive EBITDA in the quarter immediately preceding its acquisition. With most of its development costs completed, we expect Tilray will have moderate capital needs in the coming years. As such, we expect debt/adjusted EBITDA to decline

The company has historically used equity issuances for cash needs, which bodes well for its financial strength at the cost of dilution to existing shareholders. We think it can rely on these less as it nears breakeven free cash flow

**Capital Allocation Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024** 

We assign a Standard Capital Allocation Rating to Tilray based on our assessment of its weak balance sheet, fair investment quality, and appropriate shareholder distributions. We view Tilray’s balance sheet as weak. The company operates in an industry with medium unleveraged business risk, underpinned by medium operating leverage partially offset by low revenue cyclicality. Additionally, it has medium leverage and a sizable amount of near-term debt maturities, partially offset by a low debt/equity ratio. We see Tilray’s investment quality as fair. On one hand, we think the acquisition of legacy Tilray made sense. We saw strong strategic rationale for the combination, including consolidating production in Canada, combining export efforts in Europe, and moderate cost synergies. On the other hand, the acquisition of Hexo looks value neutral to us, with most cost synergies already unlocked via an operating partnership that began from Tilray's prior acquisition of senior secured convertible notes. On the other hand, we don’t think Tilray’s alcohol and CBD businesses will help it in THC cannabis, especially in the US. In November 2020, legacy Aphria closed its acquisition of SweetWater, a US-based craft brewery for $300 million, representing a 12.5 times adjusted EBITDA multiple. While SweetWater produces craft brews with terpenes and natural hemp flavors that emulate the flavors of cannabis strains, they do not produce CBD or THC infused beverages. Management believes the acquisition will expand its addressable market and diversify its product line. We're skeptical of the strategic rationale since it provided no exposure to the US CBD or THC markets. However, we think legacy Aphria paid a fair price for SweetWater, creating the chance for upside if it can find a way to capture synergies or operate the business more efficiently. Tilray sells CBD though Manitoba Harvest, which came from legacy Tilray. Although THC and CBD are both cannabinoids, the consumer base and regulatory regimes are so different that we see little synergy between the two businesses. Given the benefit of hindsight, Tilray's acquisition of Medmen's convertible notes looks to be a mistake because of the latter's shutdown of operations. Still, we liked the strategic rationale and thought Tilray paid a good price at the time. Thus, it doesn't affect our assessment of its investment ability just because it didn't work out as hoped. Finally, we think distributions are appropriate. Given the early growth stage of the industry and the company, Tilray does not pay dividends or repurchase shares. This makes sense given the young company has yet to hit positive free cash flow.

Tilray cultivates and sells cannabis in Canada and exports into the global medical market. It also sells CBD and alcohol. The company is the result of legacy Aphria acquiring legacy Tilray in a reverse merger and taking the target name in 2021. Canada legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018. Since then, recreational sales have come to represent an increasingly larger portion of sales for producers. The Canadian market is crowded with producers, so Tilray faces stiff competition to develop consumer brands that can lead to meaningful pricing power. In June 2023, Tilray acquired Hexo, which helped drive necessary market consolidation, but Canada remains overcrowded. We forecast mid-single-digit organic growth over the next 10 years for Tilray's Canadian cannabis business, mostly from adult use. The international medical market, which accounted for 14% of Tilray's fiscal 2024 gross cannabis revenue, is more attractive and profitable, as strict regulations limit the number of competitors. Exporters must pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants. We forecast low-double-digit growth over the next 10 years as more medical cannabis legalization expands to new markets, like Germany has begun in 2024. In 2020, legacy Aphria acquired SweetWater, a US craft brewer, and has since made additional acquisitions to grow its alcohol business, which now accounts for about 23% of companywide gross revenue. We forecast midsingle-digit growth over the next 10 years. However, we see little synergies across Tilray's portfolio of cannabis, alcoholic beverages, and wellness products as the markets, distribution systems, and regulatory systems are vastly different

Tilray has limited US THC exposure. Management believes that if cannabis were descheduled, then Tilray could export into the US medical market from its Canadian production given its GMP certification. We’re skeptical this strategy could generate much success, as we don’t think Tilray has any advantage getting its products on US dispensary shelves, many of which are owned by multistate operators. 

**Bulls Say Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024**  

Tilray's better financial health and profitability lead compared with Canadian peers positions it to lead its home market.  

Tilray's management focuses on strategic SG&A spending and running a lean business model, benefiting its financial health in the early growth stage industry.  

Tilray management's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach EBITDA profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers. It'll reach positive free cash flow before them, too. 

**Bears Say Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024**  

The existence of the illicit market limits the potential price increases Tilray can push through to consumers. 

Governments are incentivized to maximize tax revenue for products like alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis. Although alcohol and tobacco companies successfully pass higher taxes onto consumers, cannabis companies lack the brand power to do the same. 

Tilray has a history of diluting existing shareholders when it needs capital, and the risk of that remains. 

**Fair Value and Profit Drivers Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 26 Aug 2024** 

After updating our model for fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, we've maintained our fair value estimate of $2 per share for Tilray. We forecast CAGR for net revenue from cannabis to be roughly 7% through fiscal 2034. Our forecast is based on moderate price increases of roughly 2% per year. Most of the top line growth is based on higher volumes from the growing size of the legal market for the Canadian and international medical markets. For Tilray's alcohol business, we forecast roughly 6% annual revenue growth over the next decade, and long-term gross margins to remain steady in the mid-40% range, as contributions from lower margin beer brands weigh on expansion. We expect the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin to expand from 8% in fiscal 2024 to 26% in fiscal 2034. This is mostly due to fixed cost leverage against overhead expenses and wider gross margins for the cannabis business. We forecast the company will generate consistent positive free cash flow to the firm in fiscal 2028, a few years later than management's target of 2025. We forecast capital expenditures averaging 3% of net revenue through our 10-year forecast period. We assume a cost of equity of 9%, reflecting medium cyclicality of revenue, our forecast 20% operating margin, and low operating and financial leverage. Our fair value estimate does not include any specific ESG risk, as we do not see any with high enough probability for inclusion within our base case.

Captured within our uncertainty rating, as societal acceptance, usage, and legality continues to widen, we estimate cannabis faces a 25%-49% probability of seeing higher taxes. We estimate materiality of 25%-49%, as we see producers may struggle to pass on all higher taxes to the end-customer. This risk is offset by customers switching to the illicit market, preventing overly aggressive taxing in the legal market. We also note five additional ESG risks. First, we see a potential ESG risk related to the environmental and social impact of the company’s products and services if the trend of widening societal and legal acceptance reversed. We see less than 10% probability of this occurring, but the impact could be in the 25%-49% range given the likely impact on legal sales. Second, for carbon from own operations, we see risk of increased regulation for indoor production and its high electricity usage. Using lamps to provide artificial sunlight and cooling to offset the heat generated by the lamps, the carbon footprint of indoor production is sizable. However, we estimate just 10%-24% probability of occurring and 10%-24% materiality, as any regulation or increased cost would likely shift production outdoors. Third, for outdoor production, we see potential ESG risk around land use and biodiversity. Like all agricultural crops, there is a risk for damage to the natural environment they’re grown in, particularly if fertilizers, pesticides, or other chemicals are used. However, we see just 10%-24% probability and less than 10% materiality. Furthermore, we don’t think increased environmental costs would be enough to erode the cost advantage of outdoor production. The fourth and fifth ESG risks center around product governance for cannabis. First, manufacturing irregularities could potentially cause adverse consequences after consumption. We see less than 10% probability of this risk materializing, as regulations require significant testing before products make it to a dispensary shelf. Still, we estimate the risk to have 10%-24% materiality, as a crisis could drive slower growth and increased regulatory costs. Finally, increased regulation on adverse health effects could lead to slower growth or higher costs. However, we see probability as less than 10%. Health impacts are largely understood and accepted by a consumer, at least anecdotally. We think scientific studies are more likely to disprove myths about cannabis’ dangers rather than find new health effects. Still, the risk is somewhat material at 10%-24% as it would likely hurt consumer usage.

**Economic Moat Kristoffer Inton, Strategist, 9 Apr 2024** 

We assign Tilray a no-moat rating. Although the intangible assets and cost advantage moat sources could gradually develop over time, we see several barriers that prevent Tilray from earning an economic moat for the time being. Although our base-case scenario assumes that Tilray will achieve economic profit generation by the end of our 10-year explicit forecast period, the probability of material value destruction for stakeholders currently remains too high to assign anything other than a no-moat rating. We believe the most likely moat source would come in the form of intangible assets stemming from regulation or brand development. Cultivators and dispensaries require government licenses to operate in every market where cannabis is legalized in some form. As a result, companies with licenses could potentially be protected from outside competition, helping establish pricing power. However, a regulation intangible only exists if governments issue a limited number of licenses in order to not imbalance supply and demand for cannabis. For example, Oregon issued too many cultivation licenses upon recreational legalization, leading to significant oversupply and very low selling prices. When too many licenses are issued, the power of each individual license is weakened. A low selling price also reduces tax revenue collected by governments, which creates a disincentive for states to overissue licenses. We believe it is unlikely that governments would significantly overissue licenses as Oregon’s mistake has served as a lesson for regulators to have a more deliberate pace in license issuance. This same risk exists for dispensaries if too many dispensary licenses are issued relative to demand. The creation of brand-driven intangible assets could help cannabis companies establish pricing power and generate economic profits. For comparison, alcohol and cigarettes are typically highly taxed, but producers of these products have established strong enough differentiation and brand intangibles that consumers are willing to pay price premiums. Although Tilray and its competitors are attempting to establish brand equity, we see the creation of the intangible asset moat source within the next decade as unlikely since the industry remains in a very early stage. Health Canada regulates the packaging of cannabis products in a very strict manner. It requires cannabis packaging to be plain with many restrictions on logos, colors, images, and branding. Health Canada’s requirements are designed to reduce the appeal of cannabis products, especially for people under the legal age. The regulations are also intended to make the health warning messages on the products more prominent than a cannabis company’s brand. Additionally, Canadian regulation prevents direct contact between cannabis companies and “budtenders,"" dispensary workers who provide expert advice and help consumers select their cannabis. Advertising is possible in venues in which only adults will be present, but we think Canada’s limitations produce meaningful barriers to brand creation. We believe the process of purchasing cannabis is comparable to that of selecting wine, in which the choice is made on type rather than brand. As consumers can find many similar cannabis products across various dispensaries, cannabis companies will also have to differentiate their products from their competitors and establish brand equity in order to potentially create brand intangibles in the future. As cannabis shifts from its traditional smoking form to infused drinks and food products, there may be the potential for the creation of brand intangibles. However, we think the development and widespread distribution of regulatory-approved infused products will take too long for a potential brand intangible to drive excess returns within the next decade. In addition, fierce competition is likely to drive the need for greater investment into brand building, weighing on returns. The key to a brand intangible is its ability to command premium pricing and in turn deliver economic profits. At this point, we believe cannabis market share may be more reflective of distribution rather than brand, especially as the slow rollout of cannabis in Canada hinders growth. We think that brand power may strengthen eventually, but we think it is highly unlikely that any brand will be strong enough in the next 10 years to command pricing power 

Tilray does not have exposure to the US THC cannabis market due to federal prohibition. However, once US federal regulations are changed and interstate trade is permitted, there will be intense competition in the cannabis market as companies attempt to establish and strengthen their brands. This would create a highly competitive environment that would likely limit the potential return on marketing spend for any single brand. While typical consumer products companies, and even tobacco companies earlier in their history, have built brand recognition through advertising campaigns, we expect cannabis will face the same, if not stricter, advertising limitations to tobacco in the United States. We believe this makes it even harder for cannabis companies to build a recognizable brand, as opportunities to address the consumer will be limited. Under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, tobacco product advertising faces restrictions, including outdoor advertising near schools and playgrounds, sports and entertainment brand sponsorships, and point-ofsale advertising. Advertising on television and radio has been banned since 1971 by the FCC. Although tobacco companies spend roughly $10 billion on marketing in the US, roughly two thirds is spent on price discounts to reduce the cost of cigarettes to consumers. While this may help tobacco companies protect existing brand intangibles with its customers, we don’t think the same strategy could build a new brand intangible in cannabis.

There is no way to know exactly how long the process will take for the DEA to determine if it will initiate rulemaking. It could happen in days, weeks, months, or even years. HOWEVER, the politics involved in rescheduling indicate that a decision will likely be made in the next few months, not years.

Another example, in September 1998 FDA recommended to DEA that Marinol be rescheduled to Schedule III, and in July 1999 DEA rescheduled Marinol to Schedule III.

So the answer is within months but possibly sooner, especially with Biden Administration, HHS, FDA involved.

HOW LIKELY IS FOR DEA TO RESCHEDULE CANNABIS: 90%

According to the Report, the DEA “CONFIRMED” in a 2020 congressional hearing that IT WILL BE BOUND by the FDA’s RECOMMENDATION, “and if past is prologue, it could be likely that DEA will reschedule marijuana according to HHS’s RECOMMENDATION.”

Tilray marked its five-year leadership in the Canadian cannabis market, holding a 13.4% market share. The company has engaged in substantial acquisitions like Truss Beverage and HEXO and has formed partnerships with the Canadian government and other entities to advance the industry.

Tilray's recent financial report for the August quarter had higher-than-expected losses but increased sales, making it a mixed performance for investors. The company maintained its fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA target and expanded its market share in the Canadian cannabis market. 

Tilray's expansion into different sectors, including alcoholic beverages and cannabis-related products, introduces potential volatility in its financial results.

TLRY went from 4 up to 10 in the last two weeks. It could go a lot higher and the stock could come down more. Not much more though. At least I don't think it will. One thing I know for certain is that a Short squeeze is imminent.

If DEA reschedules to III as expected, it will not impact Tilray, Canopy or other LPs. Most legal states have already awarded licenses to existing MSOs and other US operators. While Canopy claims ""ready to enter US market"", that is only possible on full US legalization (according to the terms of Canopy's investment in Acreage Holdings). The real beneficiaries of rescheduling are certain to be US MSOs as pointed out by numerous analysts.

Will SAFE/SAFER banking act benefit Canadian LPs? Not at all. Canadian LPs already have access to banking and other financial services. Also, Canadian LPs trade on major US exchanges. So, no benefit to these LPs. The Canadian LPs raised billions of $$ through IPOs and investments in 2018 and 2019 and have burned through the cash. Canopy raised money through IPO and then received billions in investment from Constellation. Canopy burned most of the cash and today is on stage 4 cancer. Look at the stock price and valuation reflecting the state of the company. These LPs have lost most of their values. Tilray is in dire straits but its management is fast pivoting to beer business realizing Tilray has no future in cannabis. Tilray is buying craft breweries and Canopy is growing tomatoes (real). Even if Tilray and Canopy could enter the US market miraculously next week, these LPs would not be able to compete with the US MSOs who have large footprints and experience in the US market. Investing in Canadian LPs is a losing proposition.

As more states open up to recreational sale in 2024, expect US MSOs to see revenue surge. In less than 3 weeks on October 7, Ohio voters are expected to pass legalization which will open up midwest's second biggest market to full rec sale. The big beneficiaries are expected to be Cresco, Green Thumb, Curaleaf, Columbia Care and a handful of other MSOs. When Ohio legalizes, Pennsylvania will be surrounded by legal states on most sides and is expected to legalize by early 2024. New York will open rec market to the MSOs which will be a huge boost to the top line of the big MSOs like Curaleaf, Green Thumb, Cresco, Columbia and others. Just these three states' (New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania) combined market is estimated to be bigger than Canada's market. These three states have a combined population slightly greater than Canada's, however, US consumers spend significantly more on cannabis because of a number of factors (more disposable income due to lower taxes, higher wages, etc).

&#x200B;

I asked GBT and it said this.   What can you add?

Tilray Inc. (TLRY) is a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company that has gained significant attention in the stock market, particularly due to the legalization and growing acceptance of cannabis for both medical and recreational use. The TLRY story involves several key aspects:

Early Entrant in the Cannabis Industry: Tilray was founded in 2013 by Brendan Kennedy, Christian Groh, and Michael Blue. It quickly became one of the early players in the cannabis industry, focusing on medical cannabis initially.

Canadian Legalization: Canada became the first G7 country to legalize recreational cannabis in October 2018. This move led to a surge in cannabis-related companies like Tilray, as they were positioned to benefit from the newly regulated market.

Partnership and Investment: Tilray made strategic partnerships and received investments from major companies. In 2018, it secured a partnership with pharmaceutical giant Novartis, which was seen as a validation of the medical cannabis industry's potential. Furthermore, in December 2018, it received a substantial $100 million investment from Privateer Holdings, a private equity firm focused on cannabis investments.

IPO and Stock Surge: Tilray went public on the NASDAQ in July 2018, becoming one of the first cannabis companies to do so. The stock price surged dramatically following its IPO, reaching an all-time high in September 2018.

Expansion and Acquisitions: Tilray expanded its operations beyond Canada, establishing a presence in other countries with legalized medical cannabis and exporting its products. It also engaged in mergers and acquisitions, including the acquisition of Manitoba Harvest, a hemp food producer, and a merger with Aphria in May 2021, creating one of the largest cannabis companies by revenue.

Speculative Frenzy: The cannabis industry attracted significant speculative interest, with many investors hoping to capitalize on the potential for global legalization and exponential growth. This speculative fervor led to extreme price volatility in Tilray's stock.

Regulatory Challenges: The cannabis industry faced and continues to face regulatory challenges, as laws and regulations surrounding cannabis vary widely by jurisdiction. Investors in companies like Tilray have to navigate these uncertainties.

Competitive Market: As the cannabis industry grows, it becomes increasingly competitive, with more companies entering the market. This competition can put pressure on established players like Tilray.

Volatile Stock Price: Tilray's stock price has been highly volatile, experiencing significant price swings over the years. This volatility can be attributed to factors like market sentiment, changes in cannabis laws, and financial performance.

It's important to understand that the ""thesis"" for investing in Tilray or any cannabis stock can vary significantly among investors. Some might see it as a long-term play on the potential global expansion of the cannabis market, while others may view it as a short-term speculative opportunity. However, investing in volatile stocks like Tilray can be risky, and it's essential for investors to conduct thorough research, consider their risk tolerance, and stay informed about the evolving legal and regulatory landscape for cannabis. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the cannabis industry was still evolving rapidly, and the market dynamics may have changed since then.",2023-10-14,1,14

My Current TLRY Positions.

**Large Insider Buying and No Insider Selling**.

In the last 6 months, there have been 3.75+ million shares purchased by company insiders a good indication of belief that these shares will become more valuable. Additionally, there have been no insider sales of shares since November 2022 (NASDAQ). All of these purchases happened well before the HHS re-scheduling recommendation and significant progress towards the SAFE Banking Act reaching the Senate floor.

Insider Buying | Via. Yahoo Finance

**Important Dates:**

October 6th - Senate Banking Committee vote on the SAFE Banking Act. I have seen conflicting information regarding this vote some say the vote will be on September 27th, and the vote on the Senate floor will be on the 6th, but this is unclear to me, and seems like that would move to fast for Congress. Granted even if this did pass the Senate this version of the bill would still have to pass the House, which it has many times prior, but there is doubt that this time it would pass the current House.

October 5th-9th, 2023 - TLRY next earnings date. the last earnings date TLRY came close to the expectation which they brutally missed the previous quarter, which launched a spike in the price of the stock. They are currently expected to have an EPS of -0.052 for this quarter.

November 27th, 2023 (Update: This has supposedly been debunked from the time of writing, and is likely not be true) - The rumored date that the DEA will reschedule Marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 substance. NOTE: I do not remember where I saw this written and could be the complete hog-wash WSB rhetoric I've read.

Takeaway from the dates above - I believe that if the events above go successfully TLRY stock is capable of going up 100% at least in the short term, but likely to stay at the increased price. I believe these dates will be the catalyst event for this stock to start reaching a fair price.

**TLRY's Already Worldwide Presence:**

Tilray already has a worldwide presence which makes them prime for expansion worldwide with already established roots. TLRY can and will take advantage of Acquiring successful worldwide companies in their scope in order to grow effectively, being a worldwide conglomerate recognizes players in each market thus knowing the competitors and allowing cost-effective acquisitions.

**Cannabis Growing Legality Worldwide:**

The global cannabis industry has witnessed exponential growth over the past few years, driven by a combination of legislative reforms, increased public acceptance, and a growing body of research highlighting its potential therapeutic benefits. Countries across the world, from Canada to Uruguay and several states in the U.S., have moved towards legalizing cannabis for both medicinal and recreational use. This market presents a plethora of opportunities for companies operating within the sector. Tilray (TLRY), as one of the leading cannabis producers and distributors, is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. With its robust supply chain, strategic partnerships, and reputation for producing high-quality products, Tilray can leverage its expertise and infrastructure to capture a significant share of the expanding market. As more regions move towards legalization and the stigma surrounding cannabis consumption continues to diminish, companies like Tilray stand to benefit immensely from the industry's upward trajectory.

**TLRY's Beverage Alcohol Expansion:**

In Tilray's Investors August 2023 Presentation, it was stated that their mission is to become a Top 10 US brewer, while also implying that achieving this goal would have +100B in upside for the company. They currently stand at number 9 in craft brewing, and number 18 in overall brewing companies. To compare The Boston Beer Company (currently 9 in overall brewing companies) has a market cap of 4.546B, and Diageo plc (DEO) (currently no 6 in the same list) has a market cap of 89.273B. +100B seems a little out of reach even if they were to reach the top 5 brewing companies, but it is still a great goal that will provide a major upside long-term to this stock. Their recent acquisition from Anheuser-Busch Inc in August for 8-beer brands is a great step in the right direction and can foreshadow a future of more acquisitions to create a bigger, more dominant, presence in the US brewing market.

Tilray CEO Irwin Simon recently told BNN Bloomberg that Tilray brands anticipates creating THC-infused beer after legalization in the United States of America. Tilray Brands could create a presence in this niche market, and potentially even quarter the market nationwide in the US, as their beverage company expands nationwide.

**Future Acquisitions:**

On the agenda for the next shareholders' meeting is to approve an increase in the shares that Tilray is authorized to issue to 1.2 Billion plus shares. Currently, Tilray has 720.41 Million shares outstanding. If this motion was to be approved TLRY would have the ability to issue nearly 500 million shares, which at current value equates to approximately 1.5 Billion dollars. It is rumored that Tilray will use these newly minted shares as 'capital' to go on an acquisition spree in new markets.

📷

Via 9/15 PRE-14A SEC Filing

I will use this paragraph to discuss the rumors of possible acquisitions... please NOTE: these are only rumors w/o any concrete evidence. One rumor is TLRY has first-right-to-refusal on purchasing more breweries from AB; another rumor floating around is that TLRY is a front-runner to take over Cronos (including their $800M cash pile). Another rumor is taking over \[a small cap stock\] which would give them excess green-houses; this rumor comes and goes almost monthly according to Reddit. The final rumor to mention is Tilray acquiring \[small cap stock\] with all of their medical license which has dominant market control in Italy and Germany, for medical cannabis.

While I do not like to buy on rumors. I have full faith that they will not waste whatever shares they do end up issuing. I think they may go on a buying spree in American Cannabis if it does become federally legal, but that is just my opinion.

**Final Thoughts:**

The cannabis industry is at a pivotal juncture, with significant legislative and market shifts on the horizon. Tilray's strategic positioning, both in the cannabis and beverage sectors, coupled with its global presence, positions it uniquely to capitalize on these changes. The company's potential for expansion, as evidenced by insider buying and its ambitious goals, suggests a bullish outlook. While the market is rife with rumors and speculations, it's essential for investors to discern between fact and fiction. However, given Tilray's track record, its proactive approach to acquisitions, and the broader industry trends, there's a compelling case for its potential growth. As always, investors should approach with a balanced perspective, considering both the opportunities and inherent risks.

15sn7s7_TLRY,TLRY,Will Tilray's beverage bet cause TLRY stock to boom or bust?," 

In the past few years, Tilray Brands, a Canada-based cannabis company, has faced challenges, but recently, there have been positive developments for TLRY stock. The stock saw a rally due to a favorable quarterly earnings report and a major acquisition announcement.

The acquisition, valued at $85 million in all-cash, positions Tilray as the fifth largest craft brewer in the U.S., expanding its beverage-related revenue to $300 million per year. This initial boost caused TLRY stock to rise by more than 36%. However, the market's initial enthusiasm seems to be waning, as shares started to pull back.

The acquisition might not be as rosy in practice as it appears on paper. The craft brewing industry is experiencing a decline, which is why big brewers are divesting from it. Furthermore, Tilray's legacy cannabis business still faces challenges, despite recent results beating expectations. The Canadian cannabis market remains oversaturated, and the inability to access the U.S. marijuana market due to federal laws hampers growth potential.

Tilray's profitability is not expected until at least 2026, and even achieving profitability might be difficult due to growth challenges. 

But I've never felt more comfortable with an investment. TLRY doesn’t need the US to change regulations to be successful at this point, but if they do, strap in. Tilray is a global juggernaut in the making. 

 At some point, shorts won't be able to hold this back. Earnings are getting better here, and this will go up significantly. Just not on Germany rumorss, etc.; those are just called sellers' dreams.

Snoop also bought 1 million shares! It's all over the news! He's also in Germany, celebrating the legalization news! Omg buy

TLRY is nearing an area where I look for bounces on stocks as they pull back following a strong move.

Even if you're willing to wait years for the cannabis industry to grow, the risk is that the pot stock you invest in might not be around by the time markets and growth opportunities open up. It's a real risk that investors need to consider.

And with Tilray Brands still burning through $84 million in cash over the past four quarters and acquiring troubled marijuana businesses for the sake of growth, the cash burn could get worse.

Tilray has $408 million in cash and short-term investments on its books right now, so it isn't running out of money anytime soon. But without a significant improvement in its financials, it's hard to be optimistic about the company. 

Investors are better off simply avoiding Tilray Brands. As low as the stock is right now, it can always go lower.

Do you think cannabis stocks like Tilray (TLRY) might benefit from this?,"President Joe Biden on Thursday pardoned thousands of individuals convicted of possessing marijuana, saying the current system “makes no sense” and sending pot stocks soaring on the news.

The pardons apply only to federal offenders convicted of “simple marijuana possession” as well as those charged in the District of Columbia, but Biden called on governors across the country to follow suit.

“Just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either,” Biden said in a statement.

More than 6,500 individuals with prior convictions for simple marijuana possession were impacted by the pardons, a White House official said, and thousands more through pardons under D.C. law. The pardons will not be extended to those who weren’t U.S. citizens and were illegally in the country at the time of their arrest.

sql1b6_PATH,PATH,Understanding Tilray Brands Path," 

**AT FIRST GLANCE**

As of recently, I wondered why Tilray Brands seemed to be more bullish investing in products and companies other than cannabis like Sweetwater, Manitoba Harvest, Breckenridge Distillery, Green Flash, Alpine Beer. But, after doing some DD, I began to look at it from a different perspective. Although, in defense against alcohol companies being acquired by Tilray Brands such as those listed above (minus Manitoba Harvest). I think it’s a fair point to assume that it would be important to hone your discipline on what is considered initial products in the cannabis industry, ie. dried flower, edibles, vapes, etc. before getting into adjacent industries altogether.

Cannabis companies should want to acquire top-of-the-line yields, quality in their buds, and excellent efficient supply chains to and from their facilities before turning to other potential unknowns such as infusing THC into bourbon for example. However, in light of the rapidly expanding market all around the world, more specifically, the cannabis companies in the United States waiting to fully blossom from congress. I think it's important to have that first movers advantage on those adjacent companies for a multitude of reasons.

**THE TRUTH**

Cannabis, weed, marijuana… however, you want to spin those words, are SO MUCH MORE than just the stigma that has been applied to those terms since the drug war officially started in the '80s and even way before that reaching all the way back into the early 1900s. With over 400+ compounds that make up cannabis, there is much potential to be learned, and each of those compounds potentially may have a positive effect on the body and brain, and vice versa. There are a lot of unknowns and there is much more work that needs to be done to get to the cutting-edge in the cannabis sector, whether that is learning how to infuse THC into bourbon to actually make it taste decent or learning how to engineer cannabis in a pill form that is used to combat and treat incurable disorders like Alzheimer's or post-traumatic stress disorder, this is just the beginning.

**WHAT I LOVE ABOUT TILRAY BRANDS**

AND what I love about Tilray is that this company understands that, Irwin understands that, they understand that just having those initial products isn’t enough to be competitive. Hence, why they became Tilray Brands and then even moved their more “healthcare-focused” companies under one umbrella, creating Tilray Medical (Aphria, Tilray, Symbios, and Broken Coast). What’s even better is that not only do they know that is a winning strategy, but they are continuing to invest heavily on all fronts and not leaving anything behind for the taking.

So, YES, Tilray is moving in other adjacencies like the drinks, the spirits, the bourbon-infused THC, and their Manitoba products, but they are also combining so many of their other equally as important companies into medically focused products, with several current scientific studies being done. Wherein my opinion and Irwin’s opinion is that the medical side is where the most potential is and honestly where it should be because there are so many benefits that come with all the different compounds that make up cannabis and so many more that we haven’t even discovered yet.

Although many cannabis companies are on par to compete if not already competing with Tilray Brands currently, I believe that Tilray Brands and Tilray Medical have a big step forward with their recent M&A's throughout the United States coupled with their partial MEDMENS ownership and their huge global reach, including that in Germany, which Tilray is the only cannabis company with exposure there at this time.

**EXCITING TIMES**

So this is just a very interesting and exciting time and I think it’s a fantastic opportunity to be invested in any cannabis company right now for that matter, but more so TILRAY BRANDS & TILRAY MEDICAL because they aren’t just a cannabis company anymore… they are just SO MUCH MORE.

**TLDR**: They are brand-focused and respect a multitude of avenues when it comes to providing the great benefits of cannabis to everyone in any particular facet and to me I think is a winning strategy.

rr7p8j_TLRY,TLRY,TLRY MOON SEASON STARTS JAN 1ST.,"Tilray has historically dumped in December and pumped in January, but ofcourse most of you won’t buy now and will FOMO in at 300%. 

Part of the reason for this dump are tax losses and it’s also why if you look at the last 4 years, it made significant gains in January. 

Some quick facts:

- The company is prepped to hit nearly 1B in revenue (4B forecasted for 2024). With a current 3.45B market cap, this alone is the first sign of it being clearly undervalued.

- Tilray is the largest cannabis company in the world. As the weed market grows (and rivals alcohol), so does tilray. if you look at the top 20 alcohol companies globally by market cap, the last spot on that list is 2x TLRY market cap. (Massive room for growth)

- Several alcohol companies acquired that bring in revenue right now as they wait for legalization 

-Massive player in Germany, who is on the cusp of legalization. It’s about to take advantage of a weed market that’s over 100B.

Don’t wait till legalization is announced before you buy in, that’s when the ship is already gone.

r4urxr_TLRY,TLRY,Market made a mistake on Tilray; at least 30% upside,"Those who've been following the cannabis industry, knows that Tilray's recent trading performance has been underwhelming. In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to the company's trading performance is due to the Canadian adult recreational industry wide challenge along with covid-related retail headwinds. There's been struggles for the Canadian cannabis LPs to generate growth organically within the adult recreational segment. For example, while Tilray, market leader in Canadian adult recreational, generated 26% topline growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth is derived from acquisitions. In other words, Tilray's recent revenue growth were ""bought"" instead of generated organically as the market expands. Low growth within the segment along with some structural challenges and covid-related shut-downs further negatively impacted the industry's outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances.

As cannabis companies remain illegal in the United States at a federal level and debt capital raising are off the table as a result, Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to ""grow"" their toplines. Result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray traded down from $40 in February 2021 to $10 last close. Tilray's TTM EV/Sales declined from 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding market that's only 3 years old, 10x TTM sales EV is a good price in my opinion. What makes it even more attractive is that there's a catalyst that the market has dismissed and forgotten that will completely derail the stagnant market growth narrative for Tilray.

Germany's new coalition government has recently reached a deal that's set to legalize recreational cannabis use. As a result, German pot stocks popped last week on Frankfurt exchange. For example, German cannabis company Synbiotic rose by 33% to $29 Euro, which implies a $100mm market cap.

What the market has forgotten however is that Canadian cannabis LP Tilray is actually the market leader in the Germany's cannabis market. But the stock didn't move last week.

How do I know the market made a mistake instead of ""everything has been priced in"" narrative?

Easy. First, almost every German pot companies moved up last week. The fact that Tilray didn't change at all suggests that whoever was making market genuinely forgot that Tilray is a market leader in the German cannabis market.

Second, if we assume status quo on Tilray's 10x EV/Sales multiple, which is a very conservative assumption because we're completely dismissing the potential of a new, 3-days old, 83 million population addressable market. And if we proxy $90 million of additional revenue, which is another very conservative assumption as Tilray generated $90 million in revenue after Canada legalized their adult recreational cannabis market in 2018; Conservative because German population doubles of Canadian. With the conservative multiple assumption while holding other variables constant, just by adding the additional $90 million in revenue, we should expect Tilray trade up by at least 30%. The fact that it didn't trade up at the slightest suggests whoever was making market was sleeping in his office after he had his turkey.

Third, Tilray is production and distribution ready. Tilray operates two state-of-art facilities in Portugal and Germany with over 3 million square feet of production capacity. Tilray also owns and operates one of the largest market cap pharmaceutical company, CC Pharma, in Germany. Because of the company's production and distribution capacity, institutional support, larger balance sheet, domestic moms & pops cannabis producers in Germany aren't like to able to compete against Tilray in the immediate 24 months of legalization, allowing Tilray to secure market leadership. Again, this echoes with why assume only $90 million of revenue and 10x EV/Sales is a very conservative estimate.

Forth, there has been consistencies showing that the cannabis MTM is very inefficient. Most of you are aware that there were a squeeze with the Canadian cannabis LPs that took place in February. It was driven by Democrats winning the election, investors bet in favour that recreational cannabis use will be legalized in the U.S. It was similar to what's happening today; similar but different. What's similar is that both are political driven catalyst and market has gotten it completely wrong. Different was that last time Tilray were traded up for the wrong reason, Tilray has minimal operations in the United States, while they're already a market leader in the German cannabis market with operations and infrastructures that are unmatched by their competitors.

Thanks for reading, let me know if I got it wrong. Thanks.

Most of y’all assumed it was way out bc of US legalizations taking forever… Y’all went to pursue vanity in other run ups while I built my my kingdom. I have passionately followed the incessant fall in TLRY price since January of 2019… Since then I have yet to lose any money because I quite simply do not realize losses. In fact all I have done is increase my ever cheaper stock in increasing amounts 😳. Would you look at that.

What have y’all been doing?  AMC can go burn in hell where it belongs for charging 15.00 for popcorn…movie theatres are fun and all but all the big media giants have learned to profit without theatres…. In fact they profit much more… there will always be demand for theatres… but now new releases are available on native streaming platforms. 

So yeah idek why I mentioned that… tbh I may be what you call “high af”. 😘 But you don’t have to be high to want TLRY stock.. They are the best positioned of any major weed company to profit in the coming years…go check out the TLRY subreddit for the company news and developments since earlier this year… it has all the info you need. 

Basically it boils down to German, then European Legalization. With German election results showing that the SPD (the opposition to merkel) has won, legalization is nearly certain as the vast majority of that part and its supporters are pro legalization….as is their Green Party who  is most likely to merge with the SPD. (Awesome) this is big bc Germany only has two liscenced operating distributors and the largest one is TLRY…

US legalizations are just now around the corner and it’s best to be in it earlier.. the price has most likely bottomed out and after earning October 7th that will most likely show strong results we will be set for 20+

The time is now …

**Last Week –** **SPY** was lower by 2.1% last week, more than the 1.1% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.6% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$435** that corresponds to about a $7 move in either direction, with **$428** as a bearish expected move and **$442** as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday above 21, up from 18 the week before. It was above 24 several times during the week.

**When Do I Close The Trade?**

The market is in a peculiar place. If you lean towards playing growth names in tech you'll probably notice many of the tickers on your list are still down about 30-40% from their highs in February. What's the market done since then? Most indices are at all-time-highs. How does that make sense?

Over the last several months there's been a significant rotation into financial services, energy stocks, and industrial materials. Recently, those sectors have pulled back while the overall market continues to rip higher.

I do see some risk when I look at charts such as SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc. A broad (and healthy) market pull-back might affect many stocks on my watchlist, unfortunately this also includes the ones that are still down 40% from recent highs.

None-the-less, timing the market is something I am not very good at, but one of my particular skills is buying the @\*#&ing dip, a la Buffet style. I've got a few stocks on my radar for this week.

Before I get into them, people often ask me when do I decide to sell my position. This is something that can't be easily answered. Speaking from my own perspective, I generally give myself a minimum timeframe of how long I expect to hold a stock versus holding until a short-term price target. This time-frame is at least 6 months because I want to be able to say “This company is trading at X, but in 1 year I believe it will be Y”.

For example, SOFI is a ticker that in my opinion is in the early stages of growth. I would be comfortable holding this name for 2-3 years or until something fundamentally changes with the business that has me doubting it's future. It’s at $16 now. Do I think it has potential to be $35-40 by this time next year? Yes. Does that mean if it short-squeezes to $25 next week I might also sell it? Yes.

BlackBerry on the other hand, could be a mixture of both price targets and durational hold. Everyone is betting on BB’s turnaround story, which might happen depending on how strong their integration of their IVY platform is with new vehicles and EVs. This is something that could play out 1-2 years from now, but it might also participate in a squeeze next week that could drive the price way above fair value.

When a stock price becomes detached from reality and what I believe to be ""fair value"" is when I like to take some off the table or exit my position. Every investor manages and reacts to risk differently, so it’s also about finding what works for you.

&#x200B;

Before we get into the tickers for this week here's a breakdown of some of my charting rules and terminology.

&#x200B;

**Chart Guidelines & Terms**

I use the term ""meme stock"" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.

&#x200B;

Moving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.

""Red Zones"" are high-risk lotto plays.

""Orange Zones"" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.

""Green Zone"" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.

&#x200B;

As always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.

&#x200B;

# The Meme List

**Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)**

Industry: Steel

Steel has had a huge role in the ""rebuild better"" idea as well as being an inflation play. Steel prices have soared and producers have not been able to keep up with demand. In my opinion this demand is more than cyclical (short-term rotation) and could be a continued trend in the future.

CLF has already seen some huge gains YTD where it doubled in price. After hitting $24 a share it's hit a roadblock, but could be primed for another move up after this recent consolidation.

https://preview.redd.it/si7v5v358gd71.png?width=2544&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf20c4cb1e46e0ac3994318116311405f6b959eb

&#x200B;

**BABA Holdings (BABA)**

Industry: e-commerce giant (China)

BABA is one of the most under-valued stocks of all time. This was on track for $400 a share last year until a lot of uncertainties around China began to surface. There is a massive crackdown on Chinese stocks going on and this is a risky play, nonetheless I do like where it's currently trading and technically might be at the base of a cup and handle chart pattern. This ticker has been known to pick up on a lot of social media hype as well which could be the fuel needed for a moon mission.

https://preview.redd.it/1lxligc48gd71.png?width=2550&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e00f6b3fb431ce5de52628bc35ddb85a079a837

&#x200B;

**Tilray (TLRY)**

Industry: Cannabis

Anyone who was around in 2018 saw this name at $150 a share, looking back I still can’t believe it. At $14 a share this is a different story. TLRY is trading at 6-month lows with the possibility for another chance at a squeeze. IMO could be a decent play if you are patient enough to wait for it.

https://preview.redd.it/9vsoxvj38gd71.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3977bb4ebd464cf82a9dd9377dd5992d42eddcc

&#x200B;

# The BTFD List

**Air BNB (ABNB)**

Industry: Lodging

ABNB was seeing volatile price action post-IPO with almost weekly 25% swings. After peaking at nearly $220 per share, it is currently down about 40% in the $140 range. You’ll notice the orange zone I highlighted from April, which could have shown to be a good entry point, but wasn’t (as does happen). At $140 a share I like this name based off their branding and as a re-opening play.

https://preview.redd.it/kxtxk0s28gd71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebcb277e9cd1e07901d0c59dd7066322e617ccca

&#x200B;

**Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)**

Industry: Video Games

TTWO is a lockdown play that will still continue to see success as the world re-opens. Video games have gained popularity with streamers leading the way. Grand Theft Auto 5, created by TTWO, is the second most successful video game of all time, losing the number 1 spot to Minecraft. It is rumored that GTA 6 is to come out sometime at the end of 2021 or 2022. Which is already priced in, but might be a catalyst should the brand see a strong launch.

My imaginary green zone is very close to the current stock price. I’d rather be early than late so I might nibble on a position next week.

https://preview.redd.it/yt5h2bx18gd71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=4224c0f1080a5ac3a34e6f30a2db380a35d9ab80

&#x200B;

**Biogen (BIIB)**

Industry: Drug Manufacturer

This ticker has come up frequently on some of my social checks. I can’t say I know much about BIIB, but the stock ripped +80% in early June and has since cooled off. Any time a stock goes up that much in such a short amount of time there is going to be huge volatility. IMO there might be more downside to the trend-line and channel at $280, but I think there could be a good entry sometime soon or even at current levels.

https://preview.redd.it/fp8wsji18gd71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=7261a746d63889cd3dd9509d04b18a81dca4d583

&#x200B;

**Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)**

Industry: Video Games

TTWO is a lockdown play that will still continue to see success as the world re-opens. Video games have gained popularity with streamers leading the way. Grand Theft Auto 5, created by TTWO, is the second most successful video game of all time, losing the number 1 spot to Minecraft. It is rumored that GTA 6 is to come out sometime at the end of 2021 or 2022. Which is already priced in, but might be a catalyst should the brand see a strong launch.

My imaginary green zone is very close to the current stock price. I’d rather be early than late so I might nibble on a position next week.

&#x200B;

**Biogen (BIIB)**

Industry: Drug Manufacturer

This ticker has come up frequently on some of my social checks. I can’t say I know much about BIIB, but the stock ripped +80% in early June and has since cooled off. Any time a stock goes up that much in such a short amount of time there is going to be huge volatility. IMO there might be more downside to the trend-line and channel at $280, but I think there could be a good entry sometime soon or even at current levels.

ornaoh_TTWO,TTWO,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found: CLF, BABA, TLRY, ABNB, TTWO, BIIB","**Last Week's Review**

We saw some unusually strong performance in the names I gave last week which at peak were almost all in double digit gains before giving some of that back Thursday/Friday. Here's a summary.

BARK: +8.5%

SOFI: +4%

AMD: +9%

BB: +3%

WISH: ended the week flat, was up 12% at one point

SPY: +3.3%

&#x200B;

**When Do I Close The Trade?**

The market is in a peculiar place. If you lean towards playing growth names in tech you'll probably notice many of the tickers on your list are still down about 30-40% from their highs in February. What's the market done since then? Most indices are at all-time-highs. How does that make sense?

Over the last several months there's been a significant rotation into financial services, energy stocks, and industrial materials. Recently, those sectors have pulled back while the overall market continues to rip higher.

I do see some risk when I look at charts such as SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc. A broad (and healthy) market pull-back might affect many stocks on my watchlist, unfortunately this also includes the ones that are still down 40% from recent highs.

None-the-less, timing the market is something I am not very good at, but one of my particular skills is buying the @\*#&ing dip, a la Buffet style. I've got a few stocks on my radar for this week.

Before I get into them, people often ask me when do I decide to sell my position. This is something that can't be easily answered. Speaking from my own perspective, I generally give myself a minimum timeframe of how long I expect to hold a stock versus holding until a short-term price target. This time-frame is at least 6 months because I want to be able to say “This company is trading at X, but in 1 year I believe it will be Y”.

For example, SOFI is a ticker that in my opinion is in the early stages of growth. I would be comfortable holding this name for 2-3 years or until something fundamentally changes with the business that has me doubting it's future. It’s at $16 now. Do I think it has potential to be $35-40 by this time next year? Yes. Does that mean if it short-squeezes to $25 next week I might also sell it? Yes.

BlackBerry on the other hand, could be a mixture of both price targets and durational hold. Everyone is betting on BB’s turnaround story, which might happen depending on how strong their integration of their IVY platform is with new vehicles and EVs. This is something that could play out 1-2 years from now, but it might also participate in a squeeze next week that could drive the price way above fair value.

When a stock price becomes detached from reality and what I believe to be ""fair value"" is when I like to take some off the table or exit my position. Every investor manages and reacts to risk differently, so it’s also about finding what works for you.

&#x200B;

Before we get into the tickers for this week here's a breakdown of some of my charting rules and terminology.

&#x200B;

**Chart Guidelines & Terms**

I use the term ""meme stock"" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.

&#x200B;

Moving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.

""Red Zones"" are high-risk lotto plays.

""Orange Zones"" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.

""Green Zone"" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.

&#x200B;

As always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.

&#x200B;

# The Meme List

**Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)**

Industry: Steel

Steel has had a huge role in the ""rebuild better"" idea as well as being an inflation play. Steel prices have soared and producers have not been able to keep up with demand. In my opinion this demand is more than cyclical (short-term rotation) and could be a continued trend in the future.

CLF has already seen some huge gains YTD where it doubled in price. After hitting $24 a share it's hit a roadblock, but could be primed for another move up after this recent consolidation.

&#x200B;

**BABA Holdings (BABA)**

Industry: e-commerce giant (China)

BABA is one of the most under-valued stocks of all time. This was on track for $400 a share last year until a lot of uncertainties around China began to surface. There is a massive crackdown on Chinese stocks going on and this is a risky play, nonetheless I do like where it's currently trading and technically might be at the base of a cup and handle chart pattern. This ticker has been known to pick up on a lot of social media hype as well which could be the fuel needed for a moon mission.

https://preview.redd.it/1lxligc48gd71.png?width=2550&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e00f6b3fb431ce5de52628bc35ddb85a079a837

&#x200B;

**Tilray (TLRY)**

Industry: Cannabis

Anyone who was around in 2018 saw this name at $150 a share, looking back I still can’t believe it. At $14 a share this is a different story. TLRY is trading at 6-month lows with the possibility for another chance at a squeeze. IMO could be a decent play if you are patient enough to wait for it.

https://preview.redd.it/9vsoxvj38gd71.png?width=2552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3977bb4ebd464cf82a9dd9377dd5992d42eddcc

&#x200B;

# The BTFD List

**Air BNB (ABNB)**

Industry: Lodging

ABNB was seeing volatile price action post-IPO with almost weekly 25% swings. After peaking at nearly $220 per share, it is currently down about 40% in the $140 range. You’ll notice the orange zone I highlighted from April, which could have shown to be a good entry point, but wasn’t (as does happen). At $140 a share I like this name based off their branding and as a re-opening play.

**Total Addressable Market (TAM) Evaluation:**

Tilray Operates in three main regions: Canada, Europe, United States.

Canada:

* Expected to reach $4 Billion in Cannabis sales by end of 2021. Tilray has a 17% market share, with a goal to reach 30%
* Canada's cannabis market is expected to grow twice as fast as the U.S. market between 2020 and 2021 and almost three times faster from 2021 to 2022
* Tilray is well positioned with strong edible, vape, and beverage brands as users steadily switch to cannabis 2.0 products
* Canadian black market is nearly the same size as the legal market, however it is steadily declining which adds TAM for LP’s

Europe:

* EU GDP = $15 Trillion
* Population = 600 Million
* GMP certified grow facility in Portugal can export anywhere in EU 
* Dominant position in Germany with CC Pharma distribution network (access to 13,000 pharmacies)
* European cannabis market to be worth $3.8 Billion USD by 2025, growing at a 67.4% CAGR

United States:

* CBD market growing at a CAGR of 42%, expected to reach $13 Billion by 2024
* Manitoba Harvest sells CBD and Hemp products throughout the U.S. in grocery stores and online (Amazon)
* SweetWater Brewery sells cannabis themed alcohol nationally in 29,000+ grocery stores. Upon legalization they can begin crafting and distributing CBD and THC products using their distribution network.
* Tilray does NOT currently sell ANY THC products in the U.S. because they would be at risk of losing their Nasdaq listing.
   * SAFE Banking (bipartisan support) can potentially change this and allow them to execute an M&A deal with an MSO as well as allow them to begin producing and selling THC products inside the U.S. (Can NOT export cannabis from Canada)

Analysts are wrong:

* This graph shows the average price target, and Tilray stock price
* One obvious pattern is that Tilray is bullish when it is above the average analyst target.
* 2 years ago the average price target was 40-80, and now the fundamentals are better than ever, and analysts only expect the share price to reach 22

[Tilray Price compare to Consensus Price Target](https://preview.redd.it/qkwyy0zi8m671.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ba95ebdc77e397ff2e07e030d9a289929bd508)

My Technical Analysis:

* The first Fibonacci level of interest for a retracement of the move from 300 to 2 is the .382 level which has a price of 116, hence the 116 price target.
* This lines up perfectly with my Elliot Wave analysis which has a projection for a new wave higher into the Fib level

**Summary:**

Tilray is the dominant player in two high growth international markets that are expected to grow much faster than the U.S. providing 25-35% sales CAGR over the next 2+ years. EPS is expected to turn positive in the next 1-2 Years, Sales are projected to be over $1 Billion by 2022. Despite being the largest player in Canada by market share, Tilray trades at a price/sales ratio of 13 while competitors Sundial, Cronos and CGC trade at 38, 59 and 20 PS respectively.

It is apparent that shorts are quadrupling their bets on this play, in an effort to oust longs. The risk levels must be very high for those in short positions, as we have heard nothing but good news for the MJ sector lately.

&#x200B;

Here is an indication of the ridiculous levels of short interest which has gradually increased:

&#x200B;

Of all of the stocks talked about on this forum, I seriously cannot find one which compares to Tilray's level in pure terms of short volume. Over HALF the volume today was sold short yet we still ended in moderately positive territory. This set-up looks juicy for longs who want to join the train.

Due to the volatility of this stock, I’ve taken a perspective from an industry outlook to justify that Tilray presents potential growth as a leading cannabis company in the next few years. If you are looking for a cannabis stock to buy then TLRY might be a solid pick. The company presents a strong infrastructure with a multinational supply chain and distribution network, as well as strategic acquisitions that position them for long-term growth in a high-growth market.

Company Overview

**Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:** **TLRY**\*\*, TSE: TLRY)\*\* engages in the research, cultivation, production and distribution of medical cannabis and cannabinoids. The company supplies high-quality medical cannabis products to tens of thousands of patients in 17 countries spanning 5 continents through their subsidiaries in Australia, Germany, Latin America, Portugal, and Canada. They only operate in countries where cannabis or hemp-derived cannabinoids are legal and permitted under applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. Tilray continues to be a pioneer in the development of the global cannabis market and was one of the first companies to be licensed by Health Canada to cultivate medical and to be a licensed seller in Canada. They were also the first company to legally export medical cannabis from North America to countries in Europe, Africa, Latin America, etc.

**Brand and Products:**

The Tilray brand is their medical brand that’s been established as a global medical cannabis brand and is designed to appeal to prescribers and patients in the global medical market.

High Park Holdings Ltd. is their subsidiary that was established to develop, produce, sell and distribute adult-use cannabis produces for recreational purposes

* Portfolio and pricing strategies designed to compete in all tiers and product categories of the Canadian adult-use market to maintain and grow their market share
* Brands such as:
   * Canaca – a brand that is built upon a homegrown heritage with products such as pre-rolls, oil products and pure cannabis vapes
   * Marley Natural – crafted with a focus on wellness and the positive potential of the herb
   * Chowie Wowie - an edibles brand offering an array of reliably dosed cannabis-infused chocolates and gummies in THC and CBD
   * Everie – a joint venture with Labatt Breweries of Canada offering non-alcoholic CBD-infused beverages with 98% pure CBD isolate and all-natural flavours
   * Many more brands

**Tilray Inc.’s strategy** focuses on approaching the business from a long-term and global perspective. The company “aspires to build the world’s most trusted and valuable global cannabis and hemp company through several key strategies” such as:

* Partnering with established distributors and retailers
* Developing a differentiated portfolio of brands and products to appeal to diverse sets of patients and consumers
* Leveraging their production capacity in North American and Europe to meet current and long-term demand growth that is to be expected

Financial Information

**Revenue:** Tilray’s operating results are reported in two business segments: (1) licensed cannabis and (2) unlicensed hemp. Total cannabis revenue totalled $133,605,000 USD and accounted for 63.5% of total revenue. Of the total cannabis revenue, the adult-use channel generated the most at 62.7%, followed by international medical use, Canada’s medical use and bulk sales contributing the least. Total hemp revenue totalled $76,877,000 USD and accounted for 35.5% of the total revenue. YoY revenue change increased 26% that was driven by 25% growth in the cannabis segment and 28% by the hemp segment.

**General Expenses:** Tilray’s biggest expenses in FY2020 were their general and administrative expenses which totalled $85,883,000 USD or 41% of the revenue. Despite this high expense, it showed a YoY decrease of 23% compared to 2019 due to the realization of implemented cost savings initiatives that saw a reduced headcount of 258 positions and also a non-recurring cost of $4.8 million for severance payments.

**Gross Margin:** Tilray has a gross margin of 12% for FY 2020 that increased from 2019 comparable period of -14%.

* **Gross Margin for Cannabis:** Tilray’s 3% gross margin in 2020 improved from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to reduced inventory valuation adjustments and overall improvements in their cost of production relating to their cost-cutting efforts. If excluding inventory adjustments, then gross margin increased by 23% from 20% in 2019 and the improvement is attributable to the increased sales in the international medical markets and the introduction of new products into the adult-use market. 
* **Gross Margin for Hemp:** Tilray’s gross margin of 37% in 2020 increased compared to 2019 due to reduced inventory adjustments. If excluding inventory adjustments, we come to a gross margin percentage of 42% that represents a decrease from 2019 and this is due to the increased promotional activity for their hemp products. 

Recent Developments

On December 15, 2020, Tilray Inc. and Aphria Inc. entered into an agreement that would unite two of the biggest names in the legal cannabis industry. Under the terms of this agreement, each Aprhia share will be exchanged for 0.8381 of a Tilray share and as a result of this exchange ratio, Aphria shareholders will own 62% of the combined company’s common shares. This nearly $4B deal was closed last month in May and formally merged the two companies. With Aphria’s recreational position in Canada combined with Tilray’s strength in the international markets, this merger will make Tilray an industry leader in the Canadian pot market and in a position to generate more growth in many more markets.

**“Our focus now turns to execution on our highest return priorities including business integration and accelerating our global growth strategy”** – CEO Irwin Simon after the deal was closed

Industry Statistics and Outlook

* The global cannabis market is estimated to be valued at $20.5B in 2020 and projected to reach $90.4B by 2026 – representing a CAGR of 28%
   * Market primarily to be driven by the medical use of cannabis and the legalization of marijuana
   * North American accounted for the largest market share of 79.6% in 2020 for both medical and recreational purposes
   * Europe projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period due to increasing legalization
   * Adult-use segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 54.6% in 2020 and expected to expand at the highest CAGR during the forecast period
* The global cannabis beverages market estimated to reach $2.8B by 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 17.8% from 2019 to 2025
   * Heavily fragmented market due to the presence of medium and small-scale companies
   * With Tilray’s entry into this market already combined with the Aphria merger (with the acquisition of SweetWater), Tilray has a strong backing and R&D to take over a lot of the North American market share
* The Canadian cannabis industry is worth an estimated $2.2B in annual sales 
   * Second fastest-growing industry in Canada at more than 28% annually

Investment Thesis: Strategic Acquisitions and Mergers

Aphria’s strong balance sheet and financials provide a great platform for future profitability and cash flow generation with many growth opportunities. As well, the combined company will have access to capital giving the company the power to easily accelerate its growth and deliver attractive returns for shareholders. 

Together with Aprhia, Tilray has a portfolio of carefully curated brands with diverse product offerings across all consumer segments. Tilray’s merger with Aphria will increase its Canadian market share and further diversify its available product offerings. Aphria’s acquisition of SweetWater Brewing Company, a cannabis lifestyle branded craft brewer, in November 2020 gave the business a position in setting up to sell cannabis-infused beverages once legal in the U.S. As well, Tilray’s most recent agreement with Authentic Brands Group and also the acquisition of Manitoba Harvest, a leading hemp food manufacturer and pioneer in branded CBD and wellness products, will also allow Tilray to penetrate the U.S market and enter a new line of products. Currently with the merger, Tilray will offer products in every major cannabis category such as flower, pre-roll, oils, capsules, vapes, edibles and beverages and establish a stronger brand and presence worldwide.

With potential legislation changes ahead towards the legalization of marijuana, it will give the industry immense potential for growth in the coming years. With established segments in cannabis-infused beverages through SweetWater and hemp, CBD and wellness products through Manitoba Harvest, Tilray is positioned with strong financials to execute its growth strategy. When marijuana becomes legal in other parts of the world, Tilray will be well-positioned to compete in the market given its strong brand and distribution system in place. 

Risks

**Competition from the illicit cannabis market could impact their ability to succeed.** Competition from marijuana black markets limits Tilray’s ability to potentially increase product pricing. Despite the legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada, illegal dispensaries and black markets are abundant and a direct competitor to their business. In addition, these illicit market operations may offer products with higher concentrations than what is prohibited under Canadian regulations and may offer lower prices. This adversely affects Tilray’s market share and potential sales.

**Research of the health effects of medical cannabis is relatively new and subject to further study which could impact demand for their medical cannabis products.** Research regarding the viability, safety, efficacy and dosing of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids such as CBD and THC remains in early stages. Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to Tilray’s business and adversely affect the social acceptance of cannabis and demand for its products.

[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/legal-marijuana-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/legal-marijuana-market)  30% YoY growth for TLRY stock gives a projected value of $248 in 2031. That's 13.7x return. No doubt it will be a bumpy ride. But it's got value in an industry that is rapidly growing and in my humble opinion is a good long term investment particularly at these levels.

nktkfy_TLRY,TLRY,Legalisation of marijuana is proceeding. Possibly TLRY (Tilray) will explode soon,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Tilray's merger with Aphria paved the way for creating the world's largest cannabis company (by revenue). After checking out a lot about TLRY i was buying 1.170 Tilray-stocks today. I\`m sure this stock has really a lot of potential to explode completely.",2021-05-25,542,240
nffr0q_TLRY,TLRY,I got screwed by aphria / tilray options,"I made a pretty major error. Silly me was looking at selling cash secured puts on tilray. The stock was trading at $16 last week and and when I looked at the puts at $15.50 strike price ending may 14, I saw a large spread between $1 bid and $3 bid. I couldn't understand it, but with 4 days till expiry I thought tilray was worth it no matter what, I put on the market 60 contracts at $1.50, strike price $15.50. 

It's sold instantly, and I was pretty happy putting 9K in the bank. I was thinking that just as long as The stock remained over 15.50 I'd be fine. Boy was I wrong... Easy way to instantly lose 20% your investment in a few days.

Tlry shares went down even more so at $14.50. furthermore, I discovered that the options I sold were not tilray proper options, they were tlry1 options, which are old aphr options. I only discovered yesterday that for every option of 100 shares, I only get .83. so that means that I have to purchase a hundred shares at $15.50 but only get 83 shares per lot. Every share I needed to buy would cost me $18.674698795 each.

Selling 60 lots at $15.5 strike for $1.50 premium, I got $9000. When assigned, it cost me $93,000. It's current value now is $77,000 (4980 shares at $15.50) for a loss of 16k in 5 trading days. 

I'm going to start selling covered calls and if I'm lucky I'll break even soon. but I'm an idiot, don't make the same error as me. I didn't keep up with the news and didn't realize there's two different classes of tilray options",2021-05-18,22,30

mgwn4n_TLRY,TLRY,TILRAY (TLRY) NEW YORK APPROVES MARIJUANA BILL FOR RECREATIONAL USE,"Jonathan M Block (SA News)
The New York State Senate Tuesday evening approved a bill that would legalize marijuana for recreational use by a vote of 40-23.
The bill, the Marijuana and Taxation Act, is expected to easily pass the State Assembly.
Although Gov. Andrew Cuomo (Dem.) has said he will sign the legislation and cannabis legalization would then become legal immediately, marijuana sales in stores would take 18 months to two years to start, according to State Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes.
Cuomo's office has said that once fully implemented, marijuana legalization is expected to rake in $350M annually in tax revenue.

I can’t say where things actually are going, because one can say bonds, one can say travel, one can say oil, but to be honest, no one knows except the ones who control the media. 

In the Cannabis industry, there is so much progress from legalization in the states, to Mexico, to international regulations relaxing. That being said, this “market correction” has no business affecting the cannabis market. The cannabis market is one in itself, and the trend for this industry should be completely
Broken from nasdaq, s&p and Dow. So tomorrow, even though we see red for futures, I hope the trend doesn’t follow like it has been for the last couple weeks. Unfortunately, it’s probably not going to decouple like it should, but I’m hoping the media can start supporting that narrative. Long term, very bullish. In the next two weeks, I’m sure.

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting ""real DD"" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling ""MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS""

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) ""$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE"" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on ""overall strength""
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST ""SENTIMENT"" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.

*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)*

&#x200B;

**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**

**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in. Just be done with the trade afterwards. You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one, unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago, and in that case, you belong here, congrats on your gains and fuck you.**

**THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE. AND IT WILL END. THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER.**

And if you think *WE* are the ones driving the price up, the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want. You're holding a lit molotov, the only question is: will you throw it before it blows up?

The rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the ""HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW"", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the ""movement"" and ""lets push this to the sky"" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**

***You know what ""lets push this to the sky"" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.

**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**

# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.

Positions: I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC. I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1,000 tomorrow, and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent.

Disclaimer: I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Edit:** You know what I forgot to add? Some of the biggest holders, the cannabis ETFs and funds, you know what they did today? They trimmed their positions. And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de-concentrate shares into the retail's hands, the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent.

**Edit 2:** Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill, [https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC](https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC) \- I had thousands of shares, these are just the trades from this month, and I'm not advocating a buy, I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in. You want the gain numbers? You do the math, I'm not your math tutor, I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them. I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb.

*Yeah, I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later, that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person.*

**Edit 3: I'm getting piles of messages from people who used to follow my DD back in 2018/2019. Yes, it's the real SoRefreshing, proof:** [**https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe**](https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe)

Edit 4: Eh don't request me with ""What should I do with XX"" be a big adult grown up and decide your own risk tolerance and exits. I responded to the first 10 or so. Now I have 100. I can't. I disabled chat messages.

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting ""real DD"" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling ""MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS""

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) ""$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE"" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on ""overall strength""
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST ""SENTIMENT"" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.

*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)*

&#x200B;

**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**

**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in. Just be done with the trade afterwards. You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one, unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago, and in that case, you belong here, congrats on your gains and fuck you.**

**THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE. AND IT WILL END. THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER.**

And if you think *WE* are the ones driving the price up, the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want. You're holding a lit molotov, the only question is: will you throw it before it blows up?

The rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the ""HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW"", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the ""movement"" and ""lets push this to the sky"" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**

***You know what ""lets push this to the sky"" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.

**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**

# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.

**EDIT 2:** My bad I had the wrong conversion rate. It's late where I am. Just updated to reflect that. The point still stands: It's not that I'm bearish on weed as a whole - I think TLRY's rise compared to its peers in the industry is may present a bear opportunity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Listen up y’all. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‘round. Remember, true diamond hands don’t care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now let’s learn some basic corporate finance together.

We need to talk about TLRY.

As you all know, TLRY spiked today…and the day before…etc…up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I’m proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I’m here to explain why.

Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I’m not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I’m going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I’m going to use only numbers directly from TLRY’s merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).

Let’s start with two basic facts:

TLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million

APHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million

Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company – nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria’s stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.84:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.

We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.

Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!

Carrying on with the valuation…we add the merged company’s debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) – and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.

Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, “Why do multiples matter?”. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to…..43.9x. Let me say that again: 43.9x. That’s saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.

&#x200B;

Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!

I just want to make sure you all don’t get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don’t tell me “it’s about the potential”. Potential isn’t realized through a press release, and you know it.

Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren’t even US focused. Seriously – read their securities filings.

lhr8u0_TLRY,TLRY,Explanation on TLRY/APHA arbitrage go get everyone on the same level - there are some more factors than you probably thought,"Hello community. I’ve seen some confusion around the arbitrage opportunity on the merger of APHA and TLRY. 

People throw around the number 0.8381 *a lot*. So I think it’s important to get everyone on the same page here.

APHA isn’t trading on a discount right now. It might be, but it isn’t for sure.

A common misconception to read nowadays is that „APHA is undervalued **now** because it needs to rise up to comply with the merger ratio **later**. That’s not true. The four scenarios here are the following (since the ratio now is around 0.5 instead of 0.8381):

1. APHA rises to meet merger ratio
2. TLRY drops to meet merger ratio
3. Both rise and meet the ratio there
4. Both fall and meet the ratio there

So as you See, it’s by no means a „free money situation“ to buy APHA now to profit off of the conversion to TLRY later.

What some people are missing is, that facts like price and ratio **today** don’t hold up to **at merger-day**. 

The two stocks will converge to the ratio of APHA/TLRY = 0.8381 the closer we come to the merger. Since there is no exact date yet except of „Q2/2021“, the ratios don’t converge yet. It’s as simple as that. They will converge since people will hop on the APHA-train if they see that they get a free profit off of the conversion and people jump on the TLRY-train if they see that a conversion will profit them there. In the end, the conversion will most likely not profit anyone since every opportunity is taken.

That’s my two cents on that topic. What do you think about it?",2021-02-11,13,7

lhdqim_TLRY,TLRY,For those who are thinking of picking up some TLRY/APHA as a momentum play,"**Have been holding and adding in tranches $TLRY and $APHA since Nov-Dec, for new buyers atm, I'd advise getting $TLRY for short term due to the current situation**   


**Firstly, let me say that this is specific advise for a short term play (in and out by next Friday latest) and I think there is serious (75-125% returns in 1 week) profit potential still left on the table even at current after hours prices.**

My total position atm is

500 $TLRY Average $20.8  
1200 $APHA Average $10.1

I'm aiming to hold TLRY until \~$145 per stock and APHA to \~$45 per stock

The reason I would recommend people to still enter the stock atm

1. A lot of potential for more upside, just 1 piece of good news/announcement/tweet could send this rocketing up  
**2) Lunar New Year is happening this weekend and stocks historically tend to go up right after. This might seem insignificant but it's actually quite a big factor since a lot of Asian countries like Korean, Japan, HK, Singapore have many wealthy retail traders who are just now getting news of this rush and are starting to buy now/over the next few days. A bit like how the international rush of money into GME only happened a bit after the US rush**

Not to directly compare this to the rush of money into the ""over shorted meme stocks"" recently, but if there was a time period comparison, I would say we are currently at the equivalent point of Friday, 22 Jan at the moment. 1 big catalyst coming out such as Elon Musk tweeting, a Republican senator supporting federal legalization, etc and we'll see a massive upwards surge into the \~$150 range for TLRY.  
Even without an obvious catalyst, I think there will be a natural surge over next few days and the weekend to \~$100 because of later buyers entering now, especially from international countries.

The reason I would recommend new entrants atm to buy TLRY over APHA is

1. Short ammount (TLRY is much more shorted, \~50%. This opens the door to a chain effect situation where continued price increase will force shorts to cover and lead to even greater returns)
2. Hype, TLRY is the headline name (kinda like GME was for the WSB situation) and this means that in general for the next few days-week, it will likely go up higher/faster than APHA so if you're in for short term gains, choose this

This is partly caused by the fact that the eventual ticker after the merger will be TLRY

3) If Elon Musk/some other notable influencer does a positive tweet, he/she is most likely to reference TLRY and this could cause an instant huge bump in stock price which will affect TLRY much more than the other marijuana stocks",2021-02-11,2,15

Buy APHA not TLRY.  Why? Because APHA will convert to TLRY shares for a profit at a .838 to one. In other words 100 shares of APHA will convert to 83.8 TLRY shares.  One TLRY share at close was $63.80  and one APHA only $26.34.

83% of $63.80 is $53.46.

APHA is trading at a $28 per share discount!

There are a total of 30,555 option contracts listed in the option chain. If TLRY closes above $65 on Friday, I think there will be a lot of buying pressure. Also, the latest short interest report from 1/29 listed a short interest of 51% of the float. Perhaps many of those shorts were closed today during the massive trading volume today. Perhaps they werent. 

TLRY also was granted clearance to import and distribute their products in the UK this week. Last week they were given the first (and only) clearance to sell their medical cannabis products in portugal. Looking at the news articles, it seems they are also selling in Spain and Germany.

No sources listed since you shouldnt take my smooth brain word for it.

lgmozr_TLRY,TLRY,The $TLRY Gamma Squeeze is HERE! Numbers plus $APHA discussion,"TLDR: The gamma squeeze we previously saw in $GME is starting to happen in $TLRY. The price of TLRY has skyrocketed so high that all the call options the Market Makers wrote are forcing them to buy and hold shares to hedge against uncapped losses. Between the Market Makers and the Shorts, there are less and less shares available. My guess is that the price of TLRY will continue to skyrocket until next week, at a minimum.

CONGRATS fellow TLRY/APHA holders! I strongly believe we are witnessing a huge gamma squeeze underway. Today, the price of TLRY rose above the highest strike prices on the options chain ($42), which means all the available call options are in-the-money. Market Makers released new strike prices from $45 to $65. FYI: some brokers do not show the new strike prices ($45/50/55/60/65) right away because they are scumbags.

*How can we tell this is a gamma squeeze?*

Take a look at the TODAY's call options volume for Feb 12 expiration (this Friday):

* 30,633 at the $40 strike calls
* 6,810 at the $41 strike calls
* 62,786 at he $42 strike calls

That is nearly 100,000 call options. If you add up the call volume from $30 to $42 strikes, you get over 150,000 call options traded today! Open interest was much lower than volume, which tells me these are new call positions being opened.

150,000 call options x 100 shares per call option = 15 MILLION TLRY shares that Market Makers have to buy on the open market and hold until all the contracts are resolved next week. This is only for today's volume, WE STILL HAVE 2 MORE TRADING DAYS TO GO!

To add fuel to the fire, TLRY has a significant amount of short interest and low shares float (shares that are available for trading, not locked up with institutions or insiders):

* TLRY shares float: **\~95M** / short interest: **\~32M** / today's MM hedge: \~**15M**

Let's get this straight, what we are seeing today is **not 100% a short squeeze.** This is *mostly* a gamma squeeze. However, the gamma squeeze and high short interest has an amplifying effect on each other. Market makers and shorts both have to bid against each other to buy shares on the open market, causing the price to skyrocket even higher!

For APHA holders, we should see new strike prices released tomorrow, because APHA is trading at $27 afterhours which is above the highest $25 strike. Theoretically, we could see a gamma squeeze on APHA, but I think the chance of that happening is very very low. *Why?*

APHA has a LOT more shares float (shares available to trade) and much lower short interest:

* APHA shares float: **\~312M** / short interest: **\~16M /** today's MM hedge: **maybe 5M**

That is a ton of shares available for the Market Makers to tap into, and far less shorts to fight against. You would need something like 500k or more call option volume to apply enough pressure on MM to cause a gamma squeeze. I think a true **APHA gamma squeeze is very unlikely**.

The good news for my APHA holders is that you will probably see APHA trade up with TLRY due to the pending merger, but at a steep discount (40% or more). Lots of posts/comments are raving about the huge arbitrage opportunity, but that is not realistic until a merger date is set and we get close to that date. Plus, you will need to hold your shares until the merger, which nobody really knows how long that could take.

Lastly, This is a gamma squeeze play in the short term. Realize that once the gamma squeeze is over, the trade is over and you need to get out! I will add that I love the TLRY+APHA merger, and love the fundamentals of the company. I believe they are a long term winner with multiple tailwinds in the US and Europe. I might do another FA post with DD, but right now my priority is this gamma squeeze.

Best of luck to you all!

&#x200B;

Ok all, for the most part everyone understood what I was saying in the above post but I had some people who didn't seem to understand what I was saying so I wanted to explain it further.

&#x200B;

Typically, in any merger/buyout, the stocks will not trade PRECISELY at the price that they will merge. They will generally trade at some sort of discount (around 5%) which is what I expected on APHA and TLRY. The merger agreement states that for every APHA share you hold into the merger, you will receive .84 (roughly) shares of TLRY. So, theoretically, the price of APHA should be .84 \* TLRY stock price (minus a small discount, aka the 5% I referred to earlier). If you look at the current prices: TLRY is at 60 and APHA is at 27. If TLRY is at 60, APHA should be at 60 \* .84 which is 50.4. Vice versa, if APHA is at 27, TLRY should be at (1/.84) \* APHA price which is 32. All these numbers are rounded but you get the jist. 

&#x200B;

So the trade is this: you short the higher stock (TLRY) and buy the lower stock (APHA).

In this situation, you would short 84 shares of TLRY for every 100 shares of APHA you buy. So let's look at what happens in some scenarios, assuming you buy APHA at 27 and short TLRY at 60:

1. **TLRY goes to the moon (let's say 100 dollars). -** In this scenario, it isn't specific what APHA would do but IF THE MERGER GOES THROUGH, APHA should go to 84 bucks (.84 \* 100). So in this scenario, you lose money on the TLRY short and make money on the APHA long. 40 increase in share price for TLRY \* 84 shares = - $3,360. 57 increase in share price of APHA \* 100 shares = $5,700 gain. Net profit is $5,700 - $3,360 = 2,340.
2. **TLRY shits the bed (goes to 20). -** In this scenario, again we don't know what APHA would do but IF THE MERGER GOES THROUGH, APHA should go to 20 \* .84 which is 16.8. So you lose money on the APHA long - $10.2 decrease in share price \* 100 shares = - $1,020. You make money on the TLRY short - $40 decrease in share price \* 84 shares = $3,360. Net profit is $3,360 - $1,020 = $2,340.

If more scenarios are wanted I'll edit and continue but hopefully this is enough. Let me know if I made any mistakes in this post. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS ASSUMES THE MERGER GOES THROUGH.

My question is, which one to buy based on the merger deal? If I understand it correctly, APHA's investors will own about 64% of the combined stocks, and looking at the market cap of the companies, they're both at roughly the same level.

My reasoning is that if theoretically the market caps  (of the two companies) were the same, and APHA's shares would account for 64% of the combined total, then it would be better to buy APHA, right?

Currently Tilray and Aphria are being mispriced by the market assuming a deal goes through. I see the deal as very likely to happen. The conversion rate for Aphria shares into Tilray shares is 0.8381 which means for every Aphria share you own you get .8381 shares of Tilray. Right now, Tilray is trading around $63 per share. This means that theoretically Aphria should be worth around $52 at the close of the deal. Currently Aphria is trading at a 50% discount. Is the market assuming the deal won’t go through? Is Tilray only going up because of a short squeeze? Seems like a good opportunity for a pair trade at this crazy discount.

The deal is expected to close around March/April

lh0avi_TLRY,TLRY,"Tilray short gamma, new strikes, and vertical spreads vs OTM calls","Similar to what happened with GME a few weeks ago (I posted about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l2u65m/gamestop_options_gamma_above_60/)), TLRY saw a moment today where the stock hit its upper limit of strikes (65) and while new strikes are being added the stock took a breather intraday. You can read more about that affect in the prior GME post but with TLRY I wanted to focus a bit on spreads vs outright calls.

With stock around $55 and the 65 strike seeing a ton of buying I wanted to directly compare a debit call spread, to buying an out-of-the-money call like the 65, and the costs, risks, and opportunity associated with both. I'm neither bullish or bearish in TLRY, but wanted to point out the difference in strategies for those that see more upside from here. Here's an example of a call spread, with a Feb 19th expiry, buying the 54 call and selling the 65 call, via Options AI:

&#x200B;

A look at the two strikes involved shows just how inexpensive the 11 wide call spread is to buying that 65 call outright:

Now of course a call spread has limited upside, but paying $260 or so with the chance to make up to $840 if the stock is above $65 on expiration can be compared directly to where the stock would need to be paying $1050 with a breakeven of 75.50 in the stock. Essentially the stock needs to go toward $100.",2021-02-10,249,107

lgw1aa_TLRY,TLRY,APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage,"* TLRY and APHA are merging.
* 1 Share of TLRY is bouncing around 60/share at the moment.
* 1 Share of APHA is about 28/share

When the merger completes the publicly announced ratio of the new company to the old is that current Tilray stockholders will retain exactly one share, while due to market cap+outstanding shares at the time of the merger, APHA shareholders will retain .83 shares per current share of APHA.

So, if current prices hold there is a HUGE gap here that must close. Either TLRY must come down, or APHA must rise. Based on current value of TLRY, APHA shares have an expected value of 49.8

Based on the current value of APHA, TLRY shares have an expected value of 33.5ish

OR, if for some reason the gap stays as large as it is, APHA shareholders will realize a 78% gain at the moment of the merger.

Positions:

APHA 35c Feb 12

APHA Shares

EDIT: Some of you are a little dense.  To be clear, if the results here are

1. TLRY falls to close gap
2. APHA Rises to close gap
3. APHA shareholders realize a large gain in value at time of merger.
4. TLRY RISES more than APHA 

The obvious play would be APHA. In all three situations you are either neutral or gaining.

EDIT2: There ARE, of course, other situations in which you get boned here.  For example, the merger could fall through, TLRY could drop like a stone, BOTH could drop, etc. ",2021-02-10,1230,549

WKHS is at all time highs, and Reddit loves to pump the stock. Me? I was one of the biggest workhorse bulls with hundreds of shares in my portfolio. I rode the wave until today, where I sold the last of my shares. So... why?

Well, **90% of this company‘s value is based on them getting the USPS deal. People love to think the company is a shoe in for the USPS deal, but that’s simply not the case.**

For starters, the Biden administration doesn’t have nearly as much control over the United States Postal Service as you think. See: https://twitter.com/bradplumer/status/1354831900939079680?s=20
Even if Biden‘s number one goal was for the USPS to go all electric, he’d have to move hell and earth to have any control over that happening. And, with the contract supposedly being decided by the end of March, there simply isn’t enough time to do that.

But it gets even worse. People say “well, workhorse is the only all electric option, so at least it has that going for it.“ To that, I Bring you a conversation an analyst had with Oshkosh:

> “Your bid is based on the Ford's transit, I believe. And we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021. For your comment that you can address whatever the USPS' needs are as far as powertrain, is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit? Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?”

Oshkosh’s reply: 

> “So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.”

In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all-electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special.

Let’s get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed). **Buy mountains of WKHS puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you’re brave like me, calls expiring in April.**

10 shares of AHPA @$16.60 = $166.00 invested

1. There is a merger possible
2. Politicians pushing for more legalisation (US allowing Canada to import)

As some of you already know Tilray and Aphria are going to merge in Q2, with Tilray becoming the surviving Company.

Now the fun thing about it:

Aphria stockholders are to obtain 0.8381 of one share of Tilray for each Aphria share they own.

Tilray Stock: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY?p=TLRY&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY?p=TLRY&.tsrc=fin-srch)

They move pretty similarly, almost identically.

With the price in mind lets do math:   **16.60$** /  **26.31$** = **0,631** (**63**%)

so Aphira is only **63**% compared to every Tilray Stock

now considering we are getting **0,8381** for each Aphria Stock:  **26.31$ \* 0,8381** = **22,050$**

kxteo3_TLRY,TLRY,APHA and TLRY merger arbitrage opportunity?,"I'm not sure if the word 'arbitrage' applies here, but hopefully you get my gist.

APHA and TLRY will merge in Q2. Shareholders will receive \~ .84 shares of TLRY for every share of APHA they hold. If the price ratios of APHA:TLRY is less than .84:1 doesn't this mean purchasing and holding APHA through the share conversion will earn money?

The current ratio of APHA to TLRY at time of writing this is approx .65. At the time of writing this (7am Jan 15), that means APHA shares would have to increase by 23% in order to equal the value they will gain in the merger!

There's 3 reasons I can see for this happening:

1) I am wrong

2) The current ratio is a result of applying the risk that the price of TLRY will decrease faster than APHA or the merger will somehow fall through

3) There is an actual imbalance in the stock prices due to investor sentiment.

Which one of these is correct? And if it's #1, please enlighten me before I convert all my TLRY shares to APHA.",2021-01-15,70,23

Direction: **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **14$**

**Type: Calendar Strangle**

**Fundamental:** Tilray was originally one of the biggest IPO winners in 2018. However, the hype and the demand both died down as reality set in. Tilray is currently cutting workforce as well, showing some weakness in its operation model. TLRY currently does not generate a profit, though it is look at 250%+ YoY revenue growth. Whether the market accepts this growth is up for debate, especially in current macro environments.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 40, oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement is 18.4% or about 2.6$ Short interest is at 8%, with 4.6 days to cover.

**Sentimental**: Coming off a massive beat from CGC, Tilray is aiming to repeat its success through huge topline (not bottom) beats. Continuing on the CGC thought process, the stock had held its highs for 2 days before it came crashing down again. I believe this is due to current macro conditions that hurts speculative plays such as cannabis and fake meat. Even with a beat under its belt, there are currently safer and more profitable stocks on sale. **This is a contrarian call against option sentiments. Be careful**

Can a short squeeze happen to TLRY before and or after lockup expires?

aezlvq_TLRY,TLRY,Vertical Credit Put Spread on TLRY,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

Today, I thought I could make money off of the implied volatility from TLRY and sold an 80 Strike 02/15 Put and bought a 75 Strike 02/15 Put for a net credit of $2.70. What i'm confused about is why is my P/L Open for the position fluctuating between -$50 and +$40 even if  the long leg is way out of the money and the short leg is deep in the money. The price of TLRY can trade at $96 in a static manner for minutes yet i'll still get those fluctuations, is it the implied volatility of the options themselves the reason this is happening? If TLRY stays above the breakeven, shouldn't I get to keep my credit since the long leg would expire worthless?

&#x200B;

Thank you!",2019-01-11,17,22
acs7c2_F,F,Tilray Shareholders.,"Man, based on Tilrays actual capabilities compared to their competitors how low could their price go.  Have you really asked yourself this question? 

How much money would Tilray need in deals or actual cash to be at the same or better situation than Canopy.  If the answer is a lot you should be very, very worried.

The lockup period is ending soon and you’ve got to be thinking, is this company realistically going to be worth half as much as Canopy whose sitting with some  billions in cash on hand.   

Here is the simple answer in my humble opinion, no. 

If you are a retail investor get the f out. The privateer business model worked out very well and all their banker friends did very well. 

I’m not short Tilray, I’m just stating a position.  I’m trying to share my view as publicly as possible. 

Please destroy my thesis and prove why Tilray will keep its price levels after lockup.  For the sake of those shareholders. 

After all, this is what Tilray was valued at when it IPO’d and realistically what has really changed since July 2018:  
https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/07/19/ipo-coverage-tilray-inc-tlry/

Tilray never really saw an end to hype for their stock because the true market has been restricted due to the float size.   Thats another 70 million shares will become free trading.   A lot of the companies trading now that IPO’d around the same time are down a lot.  Look at the MSO’s some down 2/3 their market cap. They have way more going on than Tilray.

Curious about stocks like TLRY and their erratic behavior. What causes a stock like this to fluctuate so heavily and unpredictably? I don't understand how a stock that was approaching $200 just a couple of months ago is now in the $70 range.

  
Does anyone have any general insight into this phenomenon?

9lh8p4_TLRY,TLRY,TLRY Short Term Play,"I have a small position in TLRY(why- because of those juicy premiums). I have made nice returns the past few weeks, but this week I was a little too eager and am upside down on a 10/5 160P. 

I could just buy it back for a ~$600 loss, but I’m thinking it’s better to do one of two things and I want some advice:


1- Hold through exp and get assigned @ $160.  At the current price, I’ll end up upside down roughly $250.  I’ll sell a call next week at @160+ to lower my cost approx $8.00-$11.00/week.  I will keep repeating this until I can ditch the stock.

2- Roll into a calendar spread. 
Currently, I can roll in 10/12 $150P for a credit of $2.00-4.00. With this strategy, I feel like I’m not taking a loss this week, increasing my potential return and lowering my risk by $1200-$1400. 

My overall goal here is to own the stock for as cheap as possible and sell covered calls to make small weekly returns. I go back and forth because I know how ridiculously overpriced this stock is. I’ll quit rambling now...

Both strategy seem viable to me, but what are your thoughts?

edit: They just announced their convertible notes are being priced at a 15%premium($167ish), which to me sounds insanely high. There is still hope!",2018-10-04,14,7
