1ks4sth_TMO,TMO,Thoughts on $TMO,"This is a company I came across through a screener, and one that I’ve been digging into more recently. It fits the criteria of a historically well performing company that has been beaten down for one reason or another. I would love to hear any opinions on the company as I’m not as familiar with their industry as I am with others. Am I missing something? Seems like a good value play with solid positioning against peers, while trading at a solid valuation. 

Sidenote: would love to hear any other intriguing stocks at the moment/ during a drawdown. Love hearing new names and doing some DD on things that interest me ",2025-05-21,2,4
1gppivs_V,V,Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: $MYNZ) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Sign a Collaboration Agreement for the Development of Next Generation Colorectal Cancer Screening Product for Global Markets,"$MYNZ up 30% today

**BERKELEY, US and MAINZ, Germany – November 12, 2024** \-- Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ:MYNZ) (“Mainz Biomed” or the “Company”), a molecular genetics diagnostic company specializing in the early detection of cancer, today announced a collaborative agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO), through its subsidiary Life Technologies Corporation (“Thermo Fisher”), a world leader in supplying life sciences solutions and services.

 

The collaboration agreement will enable Mainz Biomed and Thermo Fisher to jointly develop and potentially commercialize Mainz Biomed’s Next Generation colorectal cancer screening test. The collaboration will harness Thermo Fisher’s powerful technologies, instrumentation and information translation systems to enable Mainz Biomed to develop the proprietary assays for its mRNA-based next-generation CRC screening tests which are redefining standards in early cancer detection. Mainz Biomed’s flagship non-invasive test not only targets the early detection of colorectal cancer but also focuses on precancerous lesions, particularly advanced adenomas, demonstrating significant clinical success in both US and European trials.

 

The collaboration will leverage combined capabilities to deliver testing solutions being developed at Mainz Biomed’s laboratories in Mainz, Germany.

 

Guido Baechler, CEO of Mainz Biomed, said: “This collaboration with Thermo Fisher will be instrumental to our goal to bring to market a home collection colorectal screening tool with highly effective detection of adenomas. Our product development will be greatly enhanced by Thermo Fisher’s knowledge and scalable, class-leading technologies, providing both partners with a means to accelerate the availability of an innovative new test for colorectal cancer screening around the world.”

 

Peter Jacobs, Director, EMEA Clinical Business Development, Thermo Fisher Scientific, said: “We are excited at the prospect of working with Mainz Biomed on their next generation screening test and are confident that together we will be able to achieve rapid progress and deliver innovative new assays for the global clinical marketplace.”

lcpoiy_DNA,DNA,Thermo Fisher (TMO) - Supplier of lab equipment and reagents for genetic testing (among other fields),"My wife is a forensic scientist and a while ago I was asking her about some of the equipment they use in their lab.  She said there are only a few companies that handle the majority of equipment used in these labs.

One she mentioned was Thermo Fisher. 

Here's their business summary from Schwab:

> Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. develops, manufactures and sells a range of products. The Company operates through four segments: Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Services. It offers its products and services through various brands, including Thermo Scientific, Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, Fisher Scientific and Unity Lab Services. 

> * Life Sciences Solutions segment provides a portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines. 
> * Analytical Instruments segment provides a broad offering of instruments, consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory. 
> * Specialty Diagnostics segment offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products. 
> * Its Laboratory Products and Services segment offers products and solutions needed for the laboratory.

With the surge of genetic focused research, I was thinking TMO might be in a really good position for some future growth if more labs open that focus on DNA / genetics / genomic research.

If you don't want to try to pick and choose which genetic companies are going to succeed and you already own ARKG, Thermo Fisher might be another worth looking into.

The share price might be considered a high entry point for a lot of people (~$490 today), but it's been a solid growth stock for me.  It does have a dividend, although it's laughably small (0.18% annual dividend yield).

Disclosure: I own 15 shares at a cost basis of $275",2021-02-04,13,10

k1ne1a_TMO,TMO,Thermo Fisher Scientific will make HUGE gains in the near future,"Ok listen up retards, TMO shares dropped this month from a high of $550 on 11/9 down to $439 earlier this week for no reason. It recently bottomed out, just started recovering, and now were left with an easy way to 5x our money simply by pressing the ""buy"" button on calls. Way easier than making $10/hr at wendys even with the frequent $50 bonuses from sucking cock back behind the dumpster. Currently it closed at $448.45, meanwhile every single analyst has been giving it a price target above $500 since mid october with the most recent rating being $550. Their profits are fucking soaring and they're literally the biggest company in their industry which is selling expensive, fancy, scientific lab equipment to rich nerds.

The closest/biggest competitor I could find (Agilent Technologies) has 1/5th of TMO's gross revenue while TMO also has higher profit margins than Agilent which also has multibillion dollar revenue. Every other competitor I found has around 1/10th the revenue or less, so TMO basically cornered the market here while second place is in this industry might as well be last place because TMO already won years ago.

Before any smooth brains point out that InSiDeRs sOlD $71m last quarter, insiders have been selling every quarter for several years so they can afford their big mansions, lambos, and yachts while the entire time the company has been growing faster than my mother's terminal cancer. Most recent insider sale was like 31 days ago anyway when the CEO sold less than 0.5% of the shares he owned for $4,799,400

This shit is way oversold, skipping the road to recovery and jumping on the mission to moon town back above $500+ easily in the near future. Likely mid $500s and over $600 a few months later.

My current positions:

1/15/21 $500 calls bought over time on Wednesday that cost me no more than $4.00 each

Positions I'm adding Friday morning:

3/19/21 $500c - buying a couple of these but they cost twice as much as January calls so January calls are better. I'm only buying 2 or 3 of these so I dont miss out on any February/early March mooning action



3/19/21 $600c - planning on getting 5 of these as they will be some serious money makers if were hitting $600 sooner than I thought

1/15/21 $600 calls - Get your big dick lottery tickets right here boys. Most recent call traded for $0.30 each so buying 100 calls is affordable for most people and this has serious, but low chance of 50 bagger potential. My dick is kinda small so I'm only buying ten",2020-11-26,31,32
jzid3q_TMO,TMO,"Ultra cold freezers, global supply chains, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and degenerate gambling.","I just found there is a pandemic going on.

2 major players should be rolling out vaccines early next year. 

The FDA is reviewing Pfizer’s ~95% effective vaccine and should approve its emergency use mid December. The biggest challenge with this vaccine is that it must be stored in ultra cold conditions.

TMO makes the reagents for covid tests and is one of the major manufacturers of ultra-cold freezers (UCF). This stock was running up until November, and has been dropping lately, possibly bc Moderno announced their vaccine which doesn’t need special cooling and possibly bc their covid tests aren’t that profitable. 

However, I just checked, and more people are going to need the vaccine than will be able to get the vaccine. Many hospitals are trying to position themselves to be able to distribute whatever vaccine they can get their hands on, my wife’s boyfriend’s hospital is a real shithole and even they spent $16k buying a UCF.

TMO has a $178B market cap and is well positioned to fill this UCF need. BOFA recently upgraded them from hold to buy, and TMO just adjusted their projected earnings for next quarter (to be announced at the end of Jan)

In addition to the private sector, with their stability and global logistics network, they would be a prime target for government contracts to help with vaccine distribution efforts from groups like The Who (I love it when good bands go into philanthropy)
