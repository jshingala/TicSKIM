1krls6y_F,F,Toyota redesigns America’s top-selling RAV4 SUV to exclusively be a hybrid,"PLANO, Texas — The top-selling SUV in the United States will exclusively be offered as a hybrid model as part of a redesign of the RAV4 lineup, Toyota Motor announced Tuesday night.

The world’s largest automaker said the 2026 Toyota RAV4 only will be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, eliminating a traditional gas engine in the vehicle for the first time. It will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but with hybrid technologies such as batteries and electric motors.

Despite a slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers have looked to hybrid models — which combine electric vehicle technologies with traditional internal combustion engines — to increase performance and help them meet fuel economy regulations.

Toyota, which started offering hybrids with the Toyota Prius in late 1990s, has been a global leader and advocate for hybrid adoption, despite an industry push in recent years for automakers to exclusively offer all-electric vehicles.

Toyota’s electrified vehicle sales in the U.S. — including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles — accounted for 43.1% of the company’s 2.3 million units sold domestically in 2024.

RAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year to nearly 475,200 units sold, including a 29.3% increase in RAV4 hybrids and 19.3% gain in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Roughly half of RAV4 sales last year were hybrids.

Sales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models reached a record 20% of new car and truck sales in the U.S. last year, to 3.2 million electrified vehicles, according to auto data firm Motor Intelligence. That encompasses 1.9 million hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, and 1.3 million all-electric models.

# Hybrid-only

David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said the company decided to exclusively offer the RAV4 as a hybrid because of its already established popularity and growing customer demand.

“The hybrid is faster turning; it has more sales orders on it, and the consumers and dealers are asking for it,” he told CNBC Tuesday during an event at the automaker’s North American headquarters. “It was pretty clear that the consumer is voting for the hybrid.”

Christ said the automaker expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, including additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicle offerings.

Seven of Toyota’s current vehicles are exclusively hybrid models, including the Camry and Prius cars, Sienna minivan and Sequoia SUV. RAV4 will be the eighth.

RAV4 hybrids accounted for 44% of sales last year, Toyota reported, while plug-in models — which offer all-electric ranges with a traditional engine that needs to be plugged in — were 6.5%.

The redesigned RAV4 is set to go on sale at U.S. Toyota dealerships in later this year. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign of the vehicle that included interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to the vehicle’s performance and technologies.

The company declined to disclose pricing until closer to the vehicle’s launch. The current RAV4 starts at $30,645. The hybrid variant starts at about $33,700. Pricing includes mandatory delivery fees.

The RAV4 has steadily increased sales since its U.S. introduction for the 1996 model year. Last year’s sales of the vehicle increased 9.3% year-over-year to a new record — making it the best-selling non-pickup nameplate in the U.S. last year.

# Tariffs

The RAV4 faces new challenges this year with President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariffs of 25% on vehicles imported into the U.S., as well as many auto parts.

Toyota produces the RAV4 at a plant in Kentucky, but a majority of its U.S. sales come from vehicles built at a plant in Ontario, Canada. It currently exclusively imports plug-in hybrid models for U.S. consumers from Japan.

Roughly half of Toyota’s U.S. sales are imported from outside of the U.S., including 84.3% of RAV4 models, as well as its popular Tacoma midsize pickup truck from Mexico.

Mark Templin, chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said the company plans to produce more RAV4 models at its Kentucky plant, but declined to offer specific plans for potential changes in production to mitigate tariffs.

“It’ll work its way out. I think we’ll build more RAV4s in Kentucky, which will help. But that’s such a big volume car. … It was the No. 1 selling vehicle in the entire market, even beating out the F-150,” he told CNBC. “Now we’re bringing out one that’s even better than that car. So, I think that we’re going to need multiple plants to build that.”

Cox Automotive reports the RAV4 finished third in sales last year behind the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado truck models, which include several variants. However, other third-party data firms have said the RAV4 topped sales of the Detroit pickups last year when breaking out the models, such as the Ford F-150 from the larger group.

Toyota’s days’ supply — an adjusted number based on the rate of sales — has been among the lowest in the automotive industry, especially for the RAV4.

Cox Automotive reports Toyota’s recent days’ supply is at 29 days and the RAV4 is among the fastest-selling vehicles in the automotive industry. The industry average is 66 days, according to Cox.

Templin said the automaker has been conducting scenario planning for different tariff and production outcomes, but the situation remains fluid amid Trump’s trade negotiations with other countries.

“The worst thing for an industry is uncertainty,” Templin said. “Consistency is the best thing we could all ask for.”

1gkxptd_NET,NET,"Toyota posts nearly 20% drop in second-quarter operating profit, missing estimates","Japanese automaker Toyota Motor on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating profit drop in about two years, as it strives to navigate the market shift toward electric vehicles.

Here are Toyota’s results compared with estimates from analysts, compiled by LSEG.

Revenue: 11.44 trillion yen vs. 11.41 trillion yen

Operating profit: 1.16 trillion yen vs. 1.24 trillion yen

The world’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a 20% year-on-year drop in operating profit during the quarter.

Net profit attributable to company more than halved to 573.7 billion yen from 1.28 trillion a year ago.

The automaker’s sales volume for the second-quarter slipped to 2.3 million from 2.42 million units a year ago.

Still, Toyota raised its full-year dividend forecast to 90 yen, up from 75 yen a year earlier.

Toyota has been slower in embracing fully battery-powered electric vehicles, with chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly saying that an “electric-vehicle only future” would lead to job losses in the automotive industry.

“There are 5.5 million people involved in the automotive industry in Japan. Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.

“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”

The company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.

Toyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.

The latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.

Early in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.

The wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.

# Toyota Doubles Down on Flying Taxis 

Toyota’s getting ready for liftoff—literally. The car giant is pumping an additional $500 million into Joby Aviation ($JOBY), the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company that’s turning the flying taxi dream into a reality. This latest investment brings Toyota’s total stake in Joby to a cool $894 million, and it’s all part of a plan to ramp up commercial production of these futuristic air taxis by 2025.

Joby’s stock skyrocketed as much as 21% on the news, reminding everyone that the future of commuting might just be airborne.

**So, What’s the Buzz with Joby?**  
Joby isn’t your average startup—it’s a leader in the eVTOL space, which stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Translation: these are fully electric aircraft that can take off and land like a helicopter but fly more efficiently like a plane. Powered by batteries, Joby’s aircraft are designed to whisk passengers over short distances, dodging traffic and cutting down travel time.

Imagine hopping into an air taxi and flying across town, all without worrying about traffic jams. That’s the future Joby’s working on, and they’re planning to launch their first commercial service in Dubai as soon as next year. However, they still need approval from the FAA and other regulators before this tech can really take off.

**A Match Made in the Sky**  
Toyota’s been in Joby’s corner since 2020, providing both funding and engineering expertise. The carmaker isn’t just throwing money at the problem; its engineers are working side-by-side with Joby to help streamline the aircraft’s manufacturing process. And Toyota isn’t new to tech gambles—they’ve been diving into everything from hydrogen-powered cars to autonomous driving. Now, air taxis are their next big bet.

Joby’s tech is seriously cool. Their eVTOL aircraft are nearly silent during flight and can carry four passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph. With a range of 150 miles on a single charge, they’re aiming to revolutionize urban mobility—no more bumper-to-bumper gridlock.

**Flying into the Future**  
The investment underscores how serious Toyota is about diversifying into futuristic modes of transportation. Joby’s aircraft could one day be the go-to for zipping from city to city or quickly hopping between airports, avoiding the dreaded rush-hour gridlock. But before you can book your flying Uber, there are hurdles like certification and public acceptance to overcome. Still, Joby has raised over $2 billion and is one of the few companies in the eVTOL space that’s well-funded enough to bring its vision to life.

With this cash infusion, Joby is poised to scale up production, and Toyota’s backing will play a key role in helping the startup take off—both literally and figuratively.

# Tesla's Q3 Deliveries Hits a Bump

Tesla just posted its first quarterly sales increase of 2024, but don’t pop the champagne just yet. Deliveries were up 6.4%, hitting 462,890 vehicles in Q3. Sounds good, right? Not exactly. Wall Street was hoping for more, especially after all the hype around China’s boosted EV subsidies. Analysts expected closer to 463,900. So, close but no cigar.

And Tesla’s stock? It dropped 3.5%—because investors don’t like being teased.

**China to the Rescue… Sort of**  
China threw Tesla a bone with incentives aimed at spurring electric car demand, but even that couldn’t push deliveries over the finish line. Investors had been riding high on expectations, especially with Musk teasing an October 10th event to show off his long-promised robotaxis. Elon even called it “one for the history books” (because of course he does).

But promises can only get you so far. Tesla’s shares had rallied 35% in the last two months, but this miss reminded everyone that not all that glitters is gold—or, in this case, electric.

**Tough Road Ahead**  
Tesla’s not just battling its delivery numbers; it’s wrestling with stiffer competition and customers’ shrinking wallets, thanks to high interest rates. Sure, vehicle sales inched up, but Tesla’s energy business? Not so much. Energy storage took a nosedive, dropping 25% from Q2. Ouch.

If Tesla wants to hit its goal of selling 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, it’s going to need a massive Q4. And we’re talking *massive.*

October 23rd is the next big date for Tesla’s Q3 earnings report—where everyone will be watching to see if Musk can pull off a fourth-quarter miracle.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Buckle up—tomorrow’s data dump is packed.

First, we’ll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there’s the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don’t get too excited—tomorrow’s forecast calls for a big ol’ zero in growth.

# Before Market Open:

* **Constellation Brands** ($STZ), the booze giant behind your favorite drinks, rode the pandemic wave but has been struggling to keep up since. The beer business? Still killing it. The wine side? Not so much. With Gen Z and Millennials reportedly cutting back on alcohol, concerns are bubbling up about the company's long-term outlook.

# Tesla's Q3 Deliveries Hits a Bump

Tesla just posted its first quarterly sales increase of 2024, but don’t pop the champagne just yet. Deliveries were up 6.4%, hitting 462,890 vehicles in Q3. Sounds good, right? Not exactly. Wall Street was hoping for more, especially after all the hype around China’s boosted EV subsidies. Analysts expected closer to 463,900. So, close but no cigar.

And Tesla’s stock? It dropped 3.5%—because investors don’t like being teased.

**China to the Rescue… Sort of**  
China threw Tesla a bone with incentives aimed at spurring electric car demand, but even that couldn’t push deliveries over the finish line. Investors had been riding high on expectations, especially with Musk teasing an October 10th event to show off his long-promised robotaxis. Elon even called it “one for the history books” (because of course he does).

But promises can only get you so far. Tesla’s shares had rallied 35% in the last two months, but this miss reminded everyone that not all that glitters is gold—or, in this case, electric.

**Tough Road Ahead**  
Tesla’s not just battling its delivery numbers; it’s wrestling with stiffer competition and customers’ shrinking wallets, thanks to high interest rates. Sure, vehicle sales inched up, but Tesla’s energy business? Not so much. Energy storage took a nosedive, dropping 25% from Q2. Ouch.

If Tesla wants to hit its goal of selling 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, it’s going to need a massive Q4. And we’re talking *massive.*

October 23rd is the next big date for Tesla’s Q3 earnings report—where everyone will be watching to see if Musk can pull off a fourth-quarter miracle.

# Tomorrow

Buckle up—tomorrow’s data dump is packed.

First, we’ll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there’s the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don’t get too excited—tomorrow’s forecast calls for a big ol’ zero in growth.

# Toyota Doubles Down on Flying Taxis 

Toyota’s getting ready for liftoff—literally. The car giant is pumping an additional $500 million into Joby Aviation ($JOBY), the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company that’s turning the flying taxi dream into a reality. This latest investment brings Toyota’s total stake in Joby to a cool $894 million, and it’s all part of a plan to ramp up commercial production of these futuristic air taxis by 2025.

Joby’s stock skyrocketed as much as 21% on the news, reminding everyone that the future of commuting might just be airborne.

**So, What’s the Buzz with Joby?**  
Joby isn’t your average startup—it’s a leader in the eVTOL space, which stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Translation: these are fully electric aircraft that can take off and land like a helicopter but fly more efficiently like a plane. Powered by batteries, Joby’s aircraft are designed to whisk passengers over short distances, dodging traffic and cutting down travel time.

Imagine hopping into an air taxi and flying across town, all without worrying about traffic jams. That’s the future Joby’s working on, and they’re planning to launch their first commercial service in Dubai as soon as next year. However, they still need approval from the FAA and other regulators before this tech can really take off.

**A Match Made in the Sky**  
Toyota’s been in Joby’s corner since 2020, providing both funding and engineering expertise. The carmaker isn’t just throwing money at the problem; its engineers are working side-by-side with Joby to help streamline the aircraft’s manufacturing process. And Toyota isn’t new to tech gambles—they’ve been diving into everything from hydrogen-powered cars to autonomous driving. Now, air taxis are their next big bet.

Joby’s tech is seriously cool. Their eVTOL aircraft are nearly silent during flight and can carry four passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph. With a range of 150 miles on a single charge, they’re aiming to revolutionize urban mobility—no more bumper-to-bumper gridlock.

**Flying into the Future**  
The investment underscores how serious Toyota is about diversifying into futuristic modes of transportation. Joby’s aircraft could one day be the go-to for zipping from city to city or quickly hopping between airports, avoiding the dreaded rush-hour gridlock. But before you can book your flying Uber, there are hurdles like certification and public acceptance to overcome. Still, Joby has raised over $2 billion and is one of the few companies in the eVTOL space that’s well-funded enough to bring its vision to life.

With this cash infusion, Joby is poised to scale up production, and Toyota’s backing will play a key role in helping the startup take off—both literally and figuratively.

# Tesla's Q3 Deliveries Hits a Bump

Tesla just posted its first quarterly sales increase of 2024, but don’t pop the champagne just yet. Deliveries were up 6.4%, hitting 462,890 vehicles in Q3. Sounds good, right? Not exactly. Wall Street was hoping for more, especially after all the hype around China’s boosted EV subsidies. Analysts expected closer to 463,900. So, close but no cigar.

And Tesla’s stock? It dropped 3.5%—because investors don’t like being teased.

**China to the Rescue… Sort of**  
China threw Tesla a bone with incentives aimed at spurring electric car demand, but even that couldn’t push deliveries over the finish line. Investors had been riding high on expectations, especially with Musk teasing an October 10th event to show off his long-promised robotaxis. Elon even called it “one for the history books” (because of course he does).

But promises can only get you so far. Tesla’s shares had rallied 35% in the last two months, but this miss reminded everyone that not all that glitters is gold—or, in this case, electric.

**Tough Road Ahead**  
Tesla’s not just battling its delivery numbers; it’s wrestling with stiffer competition and customers’ shrinking wallets, thanks to high interest rates. Sure, vehicle sales inched up, but Tesla’s energy business? Not so much. Energy storage took a nosedive, dropping 25% from Q2. Ouch.

If Tesla wants to hit its goal of selling 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, it’s going to need a massive Q4. And we’re talking *massive.*

October 23rd is the next big date for Tesla’s Q3 earnings report—where everyone will be watching to see if Musk can pull off a fourth-quarter miracle.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Buckle up—tomorrow’s data dump is packed.

First, we’ll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there’s the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don’t get too excited—tomorrow’s forecast calls for a big ol’ zero in growth.

# Before Market Open:

* **Constellation Brands** ($STZ), the booze giant behind your favorite drinks, rode the pandemic wave but has been struggling to keep up since. The beer business? Still killing it. The wine side? Not so much. With Gen Z and Millennials reportedly cutting back on alcohol, concerns are bubbling up about the company's long-term outlook. Wall Street’s calling for $4.09 earnings per share and $2.9 billion in revenue—so keep an eye on that.",2024-10-03,1,0

Denver, Colorado--(Newsfile Corp. - December 15, 2023) - NxGen Brands, Inc. (OTC Pink: NXGB) (""NxGen"" or the ""Company""), ([www.nxgenbrands.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/BpRQpIJ3rG)) announces that its first acquisition of 2023 is now ready to launch new products in its trademarked ""Disrupt the Norm™"" series.

This exciting new series of products will consist of a more hardcore ""Caffeinated Pre-Workout"", a ""Non-Stim Pump"", ""Testosterone"" as well as what the company is expecting will fast become its biggest seller yet, the new ""encapsulated fat burner"". These products will contain the innovative flavored ingredients customers have come to love from STORM, but with formulas more readily aimed at the more hard core work out demographic.

According to Marketresearch.biz, the global weight loss market size accounted for $260 billion dollars in 2022, is looking to grow past $299bn in 2023 and is expected to surpass $532 billion dollars within the decade. It is into this market that Storm Lifestyles™ is launching its 'Fat Burner' pills. The report goes on to state that the Supplement Segment leads the market with the highest revenue share with 35% of the weight loss market and North America is leading that market by highest revenue share.

Joseph Lawanson, CEO of NxGen, stated, ""We have seen this space having gone through exponential growth in the post-2020 world and we felt like we needed to aim our already great flavored products to customers who, at the Olympia and Arnold when we exhibited, said that they loved the flavors and the formulas in our products, but were used to taking something more hardcore. So we took that in mind and have spent the last 6 months working with top formulators to create what we feel will disrupt the industry. We call this series 'Disrupt The Norm™'. We want to be a company that caters to all levels of fitness. With the four new products to be launched in Q1 2024, we see this series as having the potential to be adding well over $1.5m to our topline in 2024 and people will start to understand my bullish approach to the sales of this series when they begin to see our social media presence around it build up in early 2024 and retail locations stocking these products throughout the year.""

I was talking to my friend who is more of an options nerd and asked their input and they just said to remember stocks are forward looking.

zpgxoj_GM,GM,Toyota Chief Says ‘Silent Majority’ Has Doubts About Pursuing Only EVs,"BURIRAM, Thailand—Toyota Motor Corp. TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industry’s silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.

Auto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.

Still, challenges are mounting—particularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteries—and concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.

“People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,” Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. “That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly.”

While major rivals, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co., have set dates for when their lineups will be all-EV, Toyota has stuck to a strategy of investing in a diverse lineup of vehicles that includes hydrogen-powered cars and hybrids, which combine batteries with gas engines.

The world’s biggest auto maker has said it sees hybrids, a technology it invented with the debut of the Toyota Prius in the 1990s, as an important option when EVs remain expensive and charging infrastructure is still being built out in many parts of the world. It is also developing zero-emission vehicles powered by hydrogen.

“Because the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one option,” Mr. Toyoda said. Over the past few years, Mr. Toyoda said, he has tried to convey this point to industry stakeholders, including government officials—an effort he described as tiring at times.

Global car companies have made a sharp pivot to electric vehicles within the last few years, driven in part by the success of EV-only maker Tesla Inc.

Traditional auto makers such as Toyota, Ford and GM are also facing new competition from startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group Inc., which make EVs exclusively and have captivated Wall Street in recent years.

At the same time, the legacy auto makers have a much broader base of customers, including many living in rural areas and developing economies with unreliable electricity supplies.

And their gas-engine businesses are still driving the bulk of profits needed to fund the costly shift to electric vehicles, which not only requires the development of new models but also construction of new facilities and battery plants.

The infrastructure to charge electric vehicles is meanwhile still lacking in the U.S. and many other parts of the world, making owning an EV still a challenge for many types of consumers.

According to J.D. Power, the market share for EVs in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last couple of years. As of October, it was around 6.5% of the total new-car market, the firm said.

But that is largely because EV sales are growing faster in places such as California, where there are more options and a greater willingness among buyers to make the shift, J.D. Power analysts say. Sticker prices for electric vehicles have also jumped this year because of the rising cost of battery materials, limiting the pool of buyers who can afford one.

Auto executives say the uptake on EVs could be uneven for some time, and that gas-powered models, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will endure for many years to come.

“The coastal areas, the East and West Coast, that’s electrifying much quicker than the interior of the country,” said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Sweden’s Volvo Car AB. Mr. Rowan said plug-in hybrids serve the purpose of providing buyers with an option if they aren’t ready to go full electric and are important to warming them up to the technology.

Ryan Gremore, an Illinois-based dealer, who owns several brand franchises, said he gets a lot of customers inquiring about EVs, in part because of limited supplies.

That might give the impression of robust demand, but it is unclear how it will materialize when inventory levels at dealerships normalize, he added. “Is there interest in electric vehicles? Yes. Is it more than 10% to 15% of our customer base? No way,” Mr. Gremore said.

Mr. Toyoda’s long-held skepticism about a fully electric future has been shared by others in the Japanese car industry, as well.

Mazda Motor Corp. executives once cautioned that whether EVs were cleaner depends largely on where the electricity is produced. They also worried that EV batteries were too big and expensive to replace gas-powered models and better suited to the types of smaller vehicles that Americans didn’t want.

Nissan Motor Co., which launched the all-electric Leaf over a decade ago, had until recently taken a more cautious stance on EVs with executives saying they were waiting to see how the demand would materialize.

Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company moved too aggressively with the Leaf early on, but lately demand for EVs has been growing faster than many had initially expected. Nissan said last year it would spend roughly $14.7 billion to roll out new battery-powered models. Now, Mr. Uchida said it may need to spend more.

The wild card, he said, is regulations and government subsidies globally that could speed adoption even more. “Would that be enough? The answer is it may not be,” Mr. Uchida said.

Mr. Toyoda has argued that fully electric models aren’t the only way to reduce carbon emissions, saying hybrid vehicles sold in large volumes can also deliver a short-term impact. “It’s about what can be done now,” he said.

Mr. Toyoda’s cautionary tone toward EVs has caused some concern from investors and consumers that the auto maker could be falling behind in the EV race.

Toyota has been slower than rivals to roll out fully electric models in major markets such as the U.S., with its bZ4X electric SUV being recalled earlier this year because of a potential safety problem.

Mr. Toyoda said the auto maker was taking all types of vehicles seriously, including EVs. In late 2021, it revealed plans to spend up to $35 billion on its EV lineup through 2030. Since then, Toyota has disclosed sizable investments in EV manufacturing capacity in the U.S.

The Toyota chief also said alternatives to EVs, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, were beginning to get a warmer reception from government officials, members of the media and others involved in the auto industry.

“Two years ago, I was the only person making these kinds of statements,” Mr. Toyoda said.

One of the highlights of the annual Tesla shareholder meeting held earlier today was a graph showing that Tesla has risen to #1 in the auto industry in terms of operating margin. Luxury car companies known for their solid operating margins and gross profits are solid steps below Tesla now. The brand with the second highest operating margin, BMW, is a few percentage points below Tesla’s +15% operating margin. Third-placed Daimler, at 10%, isn’t even close!

Get down to Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen, and it’s a different world.

Related to money is energy use, and one more thing Elon Musk pointed out in the shareholder meeting was that energy use per vehicle produced has come down — cutting emissions while saving money. From Tesla’s factory in California to its factory in Shanghai, the company has achieved a 17% reduction in energy use per vehicle.",2022-08-05,44,126

q0uo6y_HMC,HMC,Analysis and Valuation of Toyota,"***$TM – Toyota Company Overview:***

Toyota Motor company and Toyota Motor Sales merged together in 1982 to create what we now know today as “Toyota Motors”. Toyota’s primary business focuses on the automotive industry, selling over 7M vehicles in 2021 alone. Toyota has separated their revenues into 3 segments, being Automotive (manufacturing and selling of their vehicles), Financial (providing financing to dealers and customers), and other revenues (Toyota’s information technology business, automobile information services etc.).

***My Valuation of Toyota Motors ($TM):***

*Comparable Analysis:*

As part of my valuation process, I compared Toyota’s following financial ratios to their publicly listed competitors ($HMC – Honda, $F – Ford, $GM – General Motors, and $STLA – Stellantis).

*D/E Ratio:*

I chose to compare Toyota’s D/E ratio to their competitors because the auto industry is very capital intensive. The capital-intensive nature of the auto industry makes the D/E ratio important because it best measures auto companies financial health and their ability to meet their debt obligations. With that being said, Toyota’s fair value based off of their D/E ratio is $257/share, which implies a share price increase of 44.5%. This number is on the lower side as I decided to take out Ford’s D/E ratio, as theirs was a heavy outlier (5-6 compared to the average of 2.26).

*ROE:*

I chose to compare Toyota’s ROE ratio to their competitors because ROE shows how the company is operating. Not only is it a common ratio in the auto industry, but it also helps investors to measure how profitable a company is to them (the shareholders. By comparing this ratio, Toyota’s fair value is $217/share, which implies an upside of 22%.

*P/B Ratio:*

I used the P/B ratio to compare Toyota to their competitors, because the P/E ratios of their competitors varied largely, and I wanted to use a stable metric to compare these companies. By doing this, I arrived at the P/B ratio, which estimates Toyota’s fair value to be $112/share, which implies a downside risk of 37%.

I then took the average result of the 3 comparable ratios, which implies a total comparable valuation of $196/share, or a 9.8% upside potential.

*DCF Model:*

I projected Toyota’s financial performance over the next 10 years (to 2030) which included their FCF’s and projected their perpetual FCF’s based off of the risk-free rate of 1.474% (US 10-year yield). I then used the WACC (that I calculated in my model) to discount these FCF’s to today’s monetary value. By doing this, I arrived at a fair value of $TM – Toyota Motors of $226/share, which implies an increase in value of 27%.

***My Investment Plan:***

I believe that Toyota has the best upside potential under $180/share, and if I were to enter into a position, I would consider selling out at $211/share (avg of comparable valuation and DCF model). This plan would yield an upside of 18.41% which I think is realistic and attainable for Toyota in the coming months/years.  


Thanks for taking a look and would enjoy hearing your feedback and thoughts.

Toyota’s primary business focuses on the automotive industry, selling over 7M vehicles in 2021 alone. Toyota has separated their revenues into 3 segments, being Automotive (manufacturing and selling of their vehicles), Financial (providing financing to dealers and customers), and other revenues (Toyota’s information technology business, automobile information services etc.).

*Environmental, Social, and Governance Initiatives:*

Today, more than ever, investors are considering the Environmental, Social, and Governance initiatives of the businesses they are vested in. Don’t just take it from me, rather take it from John Tennaro (Head of E.S.G Investing at CIBC Private Wealth), who said “There is a growing demand for solutions that have the potential to lead to positive change, as we look to rebuild our communities/economies on stronger foundations \[…\] looking ahead there will be a stronger focus on the social element of E.S.G.”

This is backed by The Economist Intelligence Unit (E.I.U) who found that 76% of younger generations, and 37% of older generations consider E.S.G factors in their investment strategy (in the UK). This shift in investment mentality from mainly the younger generation is likely to persist over the next couple decades, and when this generation starts to accumulate wealth, it is likely that we will be able to see the effects of E.S.G conscious investing in the markets.

So, why does all of this matter? Well, Toyota has released their “Environment Challenge 2050”, which outlines their goals and aspirations for the future of their business. These are by far the most ambitious targets that I have seen in a large business and is sure to cater toward the E.S.G conscious investor.

*Toyota’s Environment Challenge 2050 includes:*

· Reduce the average CO2 emissions from new vehicles by 30% (90%) by 2025 (2050).

o New Vehicle CO2 emissions compared to Toyota’s 2010 levels.

· Reduce CO2 emissions throughout their vehicle’s life cycle by 18% (25%+) by 2025 (2030).

o Life Cycle emissions compared to Toyota’s 2013 levels.

· Reduce CO2 emissions from plants by 30% and convert 25% of their energy consumption to renewable sources.

o Emissions compared to Toyota’s 2013 levels.

· Reduce water use levels by 3% per vehicle.

o Compared to 2013 levels.

· Introduce battery collection/recycling systems and end-of-life vehicle recycling programs by 2030.

o Toyota also plans to develop technologies that use previously recycled materials in vehicle  
production

· Contribute to biodiversity conservation programs/activities, expand their in-house environmental initiatives, and offer nature education programs by 2030.

There are more details to their plans that I was not able to fully cover in this section, if you are interested in reading Toyota’s full plan click here (Page 16-19).

Obviously, E.S.G initiatives are not going to have a large impact on the stock prices (especially in the short term), however I thought that it was important to mention, and for investors to know. With that being said, we are about to get into the information that can help us determine potential price movements in Toyota’s stock.

***Factors that contribute to Toyota’s stock:***

*Recent SEC Filings:*

In order to get a good idea of the current state of Toyota, I have decided to go over their past 10 SEC filings. I will be picking out only the most important information from these filings and laying them out in an organized and digestible way.

*Share Repurchases:*

· Toyota has authorized the repurchase of 2,286,300 shares in September 2021($201.55M USD)

· Toyota authorized the repurchase of 13,358,600 shares in August 2021 ($1.15B USD)

*Production Plans:*

There has been a recent shortage in automotive parts in Southeast Asia due to both a decline in operations at Toyota’s suppliers, and a decrease in semiconductor supply (both due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Toyota has reviewed their production plans and has stated the following.

· Toyota will not be lowering their revenue estimates for 2021

· Toyota’s production estimates for September and October have decreased by 70,000 units, and 300,000 units respectively.

o Toyota is also unsure of the potential effects of this in November and has not yet given an  
estimate

· Toyota is suspending the operations of 10 of their 28 domestic production lines.

o This affects 9 of their 14 production plants.

· Toyota has previously suspended 27 of their lines in all of their 15 plants in August for the same reason.

o These numbers have been decreasing since then, which is a good sign.

o This had a large impact on the stock price of Toyota (-9%), however they quickly bounced back  
from this correction.

*Financial Results:*

Toyota has had quite the bounce back in 2021, as they:

· Increased vehicle sales by 85% YoY.

o Increased domestic vehicle sales by 30%.

o Increased overseas vehicle sales by 113%.

· Increased sales by 72% YoY.

· Increased operating income by over 7000% YoY

· Increased (pre-tax) income by 963% YoY

· Decreased their expenses by $225M (USD)

*Joby Aviation Merger Completion:*

· Joby Aviation consummated their merger on August 10th 2021, as part of this deal, Toyota’s shares were cancelled and converted into 3.4572 shares of Joby aviation (for Toyota’s role in funding the merger).

o This resulted in Toyota’s post merger share balances of 78.75M shares, broken down as follows:

§ 72.87M shares are held by Toyota Motor Company (TMC)

§ 5.81M shares are held by Toyota’s A.I. Venture Fund

§ 67.5K shares are held by Toyota A.I. Venture (parallel) Fund.

o This number of shares seemed too large until I found out that Toyota invested $390M in Joby’s Series C funding round at a valuation of $2B (implying an ownership stake of 19%).

[Toyota Motor](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7203.T-JP) outsold [General Motors](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GM) in the U.S. for the first time ever during a quarter and is expected to be America’s best-selling automaker.

The Japanese automaker on Thursday reported sales of 688,813 vehicles in the U.S. from April through June. That compares to GM at 688,236 vehicles during the second quarter. Toyota beat analyst expectations, [while GM slightly missed forecasts.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/gms-q2-sales-up-40percent-but-slightly-miss-analysts-expectations.html)

The shake-up was caused by a global chip shortage that has significantly hampered vehicle production. Japanese automakers, specifically Toyota, have been able to manage the crisis better than their American competitors.

“They’ve kind of defied gravity the last couple of months,” Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said. “We’re tracking them having very weak inventories out there and yet their sales have actually held up quite well. … We’re really kind of surprised by Toyota’s strength, and having a decent quarter relative to some of the competition.”

The only way Toyota won’t take the mantle as the top-selling automaker is if [Ford Motor,](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/F) which reports sales Friday morning, significantly beats analyst’s sales expectations of 645,000 vehicles during the quarter. Ford previously said it expected to [lose half of its production](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/ford-f-earnings-q1-2021.html) during the second quarter due to the chip problem.

The last time GM wasn’t the best-selling automaker for a quarter in the U.S. was when Ford outsold them during the third quarter of 1998, Edmunds reports.

Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, said Toyota is known for seeing far into their supply chain and has more experience managing lower inventories. She expects there could be major swings in U.S. market share this year due to the parts shortage.

“I would definitely expect a bit of a change in some of the market share,” she said. “Toyota has done really well, the Asian brands overall have done pretty well.”

In May, Reuters reported that Toyota was stockpiling semiconductors chips, which are critical for modern vehicles, and was not seeing any major short-term impact from the chip shortage. 

Toyota declined to comment specifically on the sales achievement but released the following statement: “We are grateful to our loyal customers for putting their safety and trust in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.  Our focus has always been - and will continue to be - on being the best brand in terms of safety and quality in our customers’ minds.  And as part of our continuous improvement philosophy, we are always finding better ways of doing things, and ultimately make better products our customers love and trust.”

*Correction: The last time GM was outsold in the U.S. was the third quarter of 1998, according to Edmunds. A previous version of this article misstated the time period.*",2021-07-02,30,21

nfl8th_TM,TM,Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021),"Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)

Why do you care? Good question, automobile manufactures have gotten higher multiples (at least for a short time) based on producing, or moving closer to producing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and sometimes just by pretending they will change their name to emphasize Electrical terminology, and of course having a company named after the people who discovered how to make electricity work gets really high multiples (doesn’t work for utilities named after Edison though). Toyota has been reluctant to move into the BEV space, did this change? Will they rename themselves after Alessandro Volta? Let’s find out.

First, I really want to thank the modern world that can take spoken Japanese from multiple speakers and convert that into written English so cheaply that I can read it on the internet without a paid subscription to anything! It’s a wonderful time to be alive!

Oh, I guess it's fashionable to add a disclaimer so the black helicopters don’t come and lock me in a bank vault without my reading glasses or something right? Fine, I make my living breaking big atoms into little atoms so nothing I say or type should ever be considered medical, financial, legal, or romantic advice. Good enough? Let’s go.

I can’t find an old blog post I read in the 2009–2011-time frame to give credit, but it was pretty insightful, the blog author did a word search for “customer” in both the Amazon and IBM earnings call, and showed how Amazon (huge number of times saying “*customer*”) would be a better investment because that’s where their focus was compared to IBM which had very few hits for “customer”.  I haven’t checked, but I think Amazon has had slightly better returns than IBM from 2009-present.

CTRL-F for “*customer*” returns **53 hits** for TM, things like:

>“And Toyota is always listening to customers, always trying to develop products that are suitable for every part of the world. And we have to remember that the goal is not electric vehicles. The goal is carbon neutrality. And even if we have the best technology, if it's not chosen by customers, it will not have the impact of reducing emissions and that's the reason why we've chosen to have a full lineup, and we've invested in all of these technologies.”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call shows just **10 hits** for “*customer*” with things like:

>“we had not yet begun customer deliveries”  
>  
>“what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit”  
>  
>“continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles”

Quite a difference in company philosophy!

Starting off with the prepared statement, this company is a beast! Their fiscal year begins and ends in March so this is for the entire Covid year without the benefit of the Jan-March 2020 pre-Covid or the reopening time after vaccinations ramped up, this is the worst possible time period and the sold 9.087 Million vehicles (96% of 2019 numbers) under the Toyota/Lexus name and an additional 7.646 Million consolidated vehicles (85.4% of 2019 numbers).

Quick note, they use the term “electrified vehicles” to include Hybrid (HEV), Plug in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell electric (FCEV). The sales of electrified vehicles were 112.3% of 2019, which I think were mostly HEVs.

They went through all the various gains and losses to operating income (currency exchange rates, marketing, cost reductions) and overall operating income went UP by 10 Billion (JPY not USD). Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.

Next the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!

Next, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:

>“By 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs”

From later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:

>“What does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.”

Then they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:

>“And globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.”

Followed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:

>“at the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. “

And

>“So for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%”

Did you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.

Next the BIG question: “**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?”

Well:

>“The supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors”

Compare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:

>“yes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  
>  
>This is a huge problem.”

Am I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:

>“The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves”

Then another important question “you also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?”

Remember the customer! Here’s part of their answer:

>“And for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly. That's one assessment. And with respect to hybrid EV and plug-in hybrid EV, those are easier for customers to choose and use.  
>  
>But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.  
>  
>And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.”

So the first hour of the two hour call was intended to be focused on the financials and the second half on the future (more long term plans) for electrification, batteries, data and Woven City. The questioners wanted to focus on all that stuff right away, so they answered the questions.",2021-05-18,22,28

---------------------

Two million EVs AND fuel cell vehicles in 2030 is an absolutely shockingly low number. Also, who do they think they will be selling these 6 million hybrid vehicles to? By 2030, EVs will be significantly cheaper than hybrid cars due to the expected battery cost decline of 60-80% this decade. Why would 75% of their customers pay more for a worse product?

mg91ws_GM,GM,Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform,"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What's in it for Toyota?**

Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

&#x200B;

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

&#x200B;

Tesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM–Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.

&#x200B;

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that “the likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.” Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months,” an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.

&#x200B;

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.

m7bsyw_TM,TM,Toyota Motors (TM) is a buy,"With a P/E ratio of 15.4x, this puts TM below the market average of the S&P 500, 34.24x.  TM is a debt heavy company which is not unusual for automotive manufacturers. But, it is a great growth stock that’s volatility is especially low. The real reason I say TM as a buy is because they are going to be an adversary to Tesla by making cheap, reliable, and driver-friendly EV’s. 

The market this year has pumped electronic vehicle start ups 300-1500%. People are looking for the next Tesla, and for the for seeable future I don’t think there is going to be one. But that doesn’t mean we can forget the most popular Automotive manufacturer in the world. Toyota has been fiddling around with electric cars for decades now. And they have many models set to release next year that are full electronic vehicles. Not to mention for those customers who are not ready to make the switch to electronic vehicles, Toyota makes some of the most gasoline efficient sedans and hybrids. Hybrids our poised for major tax benefits under the Biden administration. 

I think its also worth mentioning that finbox, Zacks, and marketwatch all project at least a 15% increase in market share price in the next 3 months. This is a great entrance opportunity into a time-tested growth stock that has a great future in the golden age of EV’s.",2021-03-17,22,56

Toyota is one of the biggest and most successful car companies in the world but their stock does not seem to be doing much. For example the average volume is around 200,000 while Ford average is around 90,000,000 and Tesla is 14,000,000. 


When comparing to Tesla, Toyota has billions of dollars in earnings every year while Tesla is losing millions every year. But when looking at chart performance Toyota stock is not moving much while Tesla is through the roof.  


I understand how Tesla is the hot company with electric vehicles but I don't understand how a company like this has a higher valuation than an established successful brand like Toyota.

**SACRAMENTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2019 /** Falcon Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: FLCN) (OTC PINK: STEV) announced today that it has signed an exclusive worldwide license to use the Real Hemp trademark and brand to market, sell and distribute any dietary and nutritional supplements containing any constituents of the hemp plant for the next 2 years. As part of this license, Falcon Technologies will have an option to buy the trademark and all the rights to the brand during the license term. As a result of the vision of Stevia Corp.'s Chairman George Blankenbaker, Real Hemp LLC (Stevia Corp.'s wholly owned subsidiary), achieved trademark status and full trademark registration on July 7, 2015 before the cultivation of hemp products became completely legal in the United States.

The licensing agreement will provide Falcon with exclusive rights to use all product images, design, and graphics, product packaging, any existing social media accounts, any related printed, electronic, and online documentation, any graphic files for product packaging, and any software files that may accompany the product.

Up until a few short months ago, most hemp products on shelves in the United States were imported into the United States. However, the 2018 Farm Bill legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp and removed it from the list of controlled substances.

Industrial hemp contains all of the cannabinoids in medical marijuana but unlike marijuana, industrial hemp is low in THC (tetrahydrocannabinol - the psychoactive component in marijuana). Some strains of industrial hemp are also rich in CBD (cannabidiol), the cannabinoid which has been featured in hundreds of news stories for its therapeutic potential to potentially treat serious medical ailments such as epilepsy, cancer, pain, arthritis, and many others.

The hemp seed and the oil derived from the seed is an excellent source of protein and essential fatty acids. Three tablespoons of hemp seeds contain about 10 grams of protein. The protein from the hemp plant is a more complete protein than proteins found in red meat, chicken and fish. Hemp seeds are sold in national health food and supplements retailers. The stalk of the hemp plant contains two types of fiber. The outer fiber can be processed into long strands which can then be used for textile manufacturing. The inner core which resembles wood can be used for animal bedding. The hemp stalk can also be used as a key component in the manufacturing of paper.

There are few dominant hemp product brands in North America today. Stevia Corp. has worked tirelessly to build the Real Hemp brand and trademark for the past 3 years. Led by George Blankenbaker who served as Vice President and Director of the U.S. Hemp Roundtable and was a founding member, Director and Vice President of the U.S. Hemp Farming Alliance and a longtime member of the Hemp Industries Association, the Real Hemp brand is perfectly positioned to become a leader in the hemp products market which is expected to grow exponentially in the United States now that the cultivation of hemp is legal throughout the United States.

William J. Delgado, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Technologies commented, ''We are beyond ecstatic that Stevia Corp. has given us this vote of confidence to license the exclusive rights to use the Real Hemp brand for the next 2 years. George and his team have done a fantastic job in building the Real Hemp brand which we believe has the potential to be the number 1 hemp products brand in the United States.''

George Blankenbaker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Stevia Corp. said, ''This is a win-win for both companies. If the result is what both companies believe the result can potentially be, Falcon will own a leading brand representing quality and health in a fast emerging market generating millions in revenue while enabling Stevia Corp. to become debt free as a result of the licensing royalty payments and potential outright purchase of the brand.''",2019-04-10,3,0

Earth Science Tech, Inc. (ETST) Reports Positive Results from Hygee™ Pre-launch Testing

DORAL, Florida, Dec. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Earth Science Tech, Inc. (OTCQB: ETST) (“ETST"" or the “Company""), an innovative biotech company focused on the cannabidiol (CBD), nutraceutical and pharmaceutical fields, medical devices, and research and development, today announces successful in vitro analyses of gynecological samples collected using its new Hygee™ medical device.

Hygee™ is a discreet, wearable medical device that enables a woman to anonymously test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). As previously announced, samples collected by the Hygee™ device are tested by Procréa. In pre-launch testing at the labs, molecular diagnostic assays successfully identified the presence of Chlamydia in test subjects, confirming earlier testing results in a cohort of more than 500 women.

ETST’s President, Director and Chairman Nickolas S. Tabraue states, “We are pleased to announce positive testing in the pre-launch phase of Hygee™, and would like to thank our carefully selected partners, Procréa, for a job well done. They are a part of the guarantee of our success.”

ETST is on track to launch Hygee™ in early 2019. The Company plans to market the product through its established distribution channels, mentioned in November, thanks to Dermagate’s ISO 13485:2013 certification.

“Hygee™ is an incredible innovation, and we have partners from many countries waiting to market the device,” stated ETST CEO and Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Michel Aubé. “This is only the beginning of realizing the potential of this unique device, and we look forward to updating our shareholders on our progress.”

In its first iteration, Hygee™ will be marketed as an at-home test for chlamydia; however, R&D efforts currently underway indicate that Hygee™ will soon be certified for gonorrhea testing as well.

About Earth Science Tech, Inc. (ETST)
Earth Science Tech, Inc. (“ETST”) offers the highest purity and quality high-grade full spectrum cannabinoid oil on the market. There are positive results in studies on breast cancer and immune cells through the University of Central Oklahoma, in addition to studies through DV Biologics that prove the Company’s CBD oil formulation lowers cortisol and functions as a neuro-protectant, with positive result case studies through key health organizations.

Amedica Announces Addition of the Valeo II(TM) Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion Device System
Lateral Lumbar Spinal Fusion Procedures Becoming One of the Fastest Growing Segments

SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 25, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amedica Corporation (Nasdaq:AMDA), an innovative biomaterial company which develops and manufactures silicon nitride as a platform for biomedical applications, is pleased to announce the release of its silicon nitride lateral lumbar (LL) interbody fusion device.  The Valeo II™ LL interbody fusion device will be commercially available in mid-September 2015, and will include second generation instrumentation to improve patient safety and surgeon ease of use.

""With the release of our new lateral system, we are now able to offer an additional lumbar solution to our line of second generation silicon nitride interbody devices,"" said Dr. Sonny Bal, chairman and CEO of Amedica Corporation. ""Initial feedback from our beta users has been positive and we're very pleased to offer this lateral interbody fusion device system, which provides surgeons additional procedure options and allows Amedica access to one of the fastest growing segments in the lumbar fusion market.""

The Valeo II™ LL is made of a micro composite silicon nitride biomaterial, which offers a superior environment for bone growth and osteointegration, when compared to competitive PEEK and titanium offerings. Amedica's Valeo II™ silicon nitride interbody fusion devices also contain anti-infective properties and are semi-radiolucent with clearly visible boundaries in X-rays and produce no artifacts under MRI or CT scans. The combination of these properties is found only in Amedica's silicon nitride biomaterial technology.
                                            
The Valeo II™ LL is indicated for intervertebral body fusion of the spine in skeletally mature patients and is designed for use with autograft to facilitate fusion. Additional information about Amedica's complete line of products can be found at www.amedica.com.",2015-08-25,6,8
