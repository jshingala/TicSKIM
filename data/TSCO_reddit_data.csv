1igvqby_TSCO,TSCO,"Anybody here owns Tractor Supply Company, TSCO?","Stupid question: What's their current yield? For whatever reason it is reported as 1.61%, but adding the quarterly dividends it goes north of 6%. And I'm not talking special dividends, it looks like they are singular quarterly divies.  I looked at their financials and yes, they indeed paid $1.10 a quarter each of the last 3 quarters. A single one of those would have been a 2% yield.

1ey1ukt_TSCO,TSCO,Retail experts- what makes Tractor Supply (TSCO) unique? Is Home Depot a formidable competitor? ,"So far my research points to TSCO stores being closer to the rural community being the moat that made TSCO quite profitable. As the population migration from and to urban/rural area normalizes after the pandemic, what edge does TSCO have? Why can't other retailer with lot more fire power like HD etc open stores closer to TSCO?  

I reckon the answer is likely nuanced like TSCO is optimized for smaller footprint stores and that's something hard for HD to copy - much like United failed miserably when they tried competing in the low cost airline category.  

  
I would love to hear insights from those who know this industry well. ",2024-08-21,1,2

k6fc6o_TSCO,TSCO,Seriously Thinking of Selling GOLD & TSCO . . . ?,"I bought GOLD at 30 in mid-Sept, and TSCO at 150 in mid-Oct. Both have turned out to be dogs, and I'm seriously thinking of selling them. But GOLD just bounced off support at 22.25, so I'm probably going to wait to see if it hits resistance at 25.50 then sell. Still, I might even hang on after that because if/when Congress produces another COVID-relief package in the trillions, wouldn't that be bullish for both GOLD and gold?

As for TSCO, the company seems to be doing great but the stock is not following suit. It's possible that it might be consolidating in preparation for an imminent turn upwards (see daily chart for 10/22 thru present), and it seems to have found support at-or-about 130. But does anyone think it's going to go lower? If so, why? Or, do you think it's going to start climbing again, perhaps to 150 and beyond?",2020-12-04,0,9

Per request
-10 years of consecutive earnings growth - owner oriented management - Return on equity over 30% and has been growing for 5 years - cash to debt is favorable - extremely cheap even compared to current government yields if they were around 5% instead of the current 1.85% - only downside is book value is quite less even though i think equity will continue to grow at an extremely high rate",2016-11-08,4,13
