1kxfemf_TSLA,TSLA,I’m heavily underweight and short a few names — TSLA’s been a real pain,"Seems like it’s a position a lot of people on this sub are in. Looking around different communities, I’d say the more financially savvy ones still show a lot of skepticism and a generally negative outlook on the market.

The market, though, just keeps holding up. The Nasdaq 100 has even moved back close to all-time highs.

Makes me wonder: is it because so many of us have a bearish view that the market isn’t dropping? 
Will a real downturn only start once everyone’s convinced it can only go up? 
And then we’ll be the ones left holding the bag?
Or maybe we’re just wrong, and the market’s going up because the economy is actually stronger than we think — and tariffs or potential inflation will be absorbed by healthy, structural earnings growth?

Over the past few months, I’ve been quietly building out a fully automated pipeline for options signal generation using Python + APIs (Polygon, Tradier for paper fills, eventually IBKR for real fills).       No machine learning or black boxes — just quant-style filtering and logic gates.

My bot currently runs:

Volatility Screening: Looks for tickers with high IV rank (>70%)，,Multi-timeframe EMA stack + VWAP reclaim logic,Only trades weekly options with narrow spreads and >$1M daily premium volume,Kelly fraction based on EV simulations, Focused on CSPs, credit call spreads, or naked calls when trend + IV align

I manually monitor execution still, but the entries, exits, and backtest tagging are all automated.       This TSLA call was one of three candidates flagged this morning;       backtest win rate on similar setups was 72% with favorable RR.

1kwnuv6_TSLA,TSLA,Defending TESLA credit spread,"About a month ago, I opened a TSLA bear call credit spread: I sold the 315 Jun 20 call and bought the 320 Jun 20 call, collecting $1.30 in premium. I opened the position because I was bearish on TSLA, and also saw it as a partial hedge.

Now Tesla has surged upward unexpectedly, and I’m unsure how to proceed. My maximum loss is $3.70, which is essentially already reached — in fact, closing the position now would cost even more due to the current spread.

The thing is, I’m still bearish on TSLA. So my question is: how should I defend this position?

It’s clearly gone against me, and with a cost basis of $1.30, I’ve pretty much hit the max loss already. Should I just wait and hope TSLA drops before expiration, or should I roll it to a later expiration or higher strikes?

Why Long $TSLA - Technical Analysis Logic

When I got involved on May 22, $TSLA had just completed a nice multiple support confirmation:

On the daily chart, TSLA tested the support in the 320-325 range 3 times at the beginning of the month (typical triple bottom pattern).

The RSI has bounced back from oversold to above 50, with momentum turning stronger.

The 5-day SMA broke through the 10-day SMA, signaling a golden cross.

Volume is enlarged, indicating that the main force is starting to enter the market.

Why sell at $19.25? Discipline is not to be greedy

I know some may say “you should have held to 25 or even 30”, but my choice at the time was motivated by the following:

342.5 is the strike price of the entire contract, and TSLA is approaching 350, slowing down the option upside.

IV (implied volatility) had spiked, and holding it any longer time decay ate it up faster

Technically touched pre-daily resistance near 355, and there are signs of stalling intraday

Pre-disc news more favorable to cash, news reversal risk increases

I'm not dreaming, I'm trading. Falling out of the bag, discipline is greater than fantasy.

Next plan: watch for potential breakout levels in $NVDA, $AMD, and $META, and get ready to get another vote!

1kvcs9x_TSLA,TSLA,TSLA vs. BYDDY – Which EV Stock Is the Better Bet Right Now?,"Let’s keep it real  Tesla’s got the hype, but BYD is quietly crushing it

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

Bottom line: If you’re betting on wild future tech, TSLA might be your pick. But if you care about solid execution, real revenue, and smart expansion  I’m rolling with BYDDY",2025-05-25,66,131
1ku94ha_TSLA,TSLA,Trying to Learn – How Do You Short Tesla Smarter?,"Hey everyone,

I currently hold small positions in Alphabet-C, Apple, Nvidia, gold, and REITs—so I’m mostly flat now and just watching the market.

Looking to learn and improve.

Honestly i haven’t seen a lot of quality discussion about the planned robotaxi launch in June. Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. 
Let’s collect all the facts and try to find what’s gonna happen in few weeks. 

Here are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. 
- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. 
- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. 
- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. 
- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. 
- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. 
- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. 
- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)
- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. 

That’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event.

1ktjam4_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Tesla: Vision, Volatility, and the Illusion of Invincibility","I have been lurking on r/stocks, WallStreetBets, etc., for a while, and I keep seeing two types of posts related to Tesla: ""Tesla is a meme stonk/it's being manipulated"" and ""This time it's going to the moon!"" As someone who has lost a significant amount of money shorting Tesla, I'd like to share my thoughts.

**Stage 1: Inception**

> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.

To understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'état to become CEO.

To Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.

This also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.

This is an admittedly gross oversimplification. There were many moments when Tesla was on the brink of bankruptcy and made smart decisions to survive (e.g., vertical integration, preorder deposits, charging station infrastructure, leveraging momentum for public subsidies, and utilizing new technologies for marketing). What's important is that Elon and Tesla equal a futuristic vision that captures the attention of idealists—idealists with money and talent.

These idealists invested billions in Tesla's preorder capital, enabling them to build the necessary infrastructure for the product afterward. Despite obvious quality control issues and broken promises from Elon, they were passionate about their Teslas. They also invested heavily in Tesla, holding 40-50% of its shares, far beyond the average of the magnificent seven.

They invested in ideology, which enabled the stock to remain stable for years despite outlandish claims, missed goals, and ongoing challenges.

**Stage 2: The Stock**

Traders noticed. They found a stock with a financial model driven by subsidies, an idolized leader, and a rabid fan base (both in the product and among stock owners) who remained loyal despite poor fundamentals, negative news, and setbacks. The perfect options trading stock. The rabid fanbase subsidized downsides, and upsides were attributed to visionary leadership and positive signs for the green revolution.

For years, short sellers have highlighted the obvious risks and challenges facing Tesla, only to be proven wrong because Tesla doesn't follow the fundamental principles expected of a standard company. In late 2020, call volumes regularly hit 8–12 million contracts daily, fueling Tesla's massive rally into the S&P 500. This also created Tesla's second flywheel: a loyal investment base that remained unflappable in the face of negative news and stood by the stock, which rewarded calls and punished puts, driving the stock prices higher creating a second loyal investor - the long-put and long-invest investor who doesn't care about the green revolution - and further garnering Elon's reputational belief that he can only do good. Today, Tesla's short interest is relatively low—only about 2.9% of the float (roughly 81 million shares short as of the latest report)—because short sellers have been burned repeatedly by relying on fundamentals.

Tesla's stock hit 'god mode' at this point. Yes, they have had a million downturns, volatile peaks and valleys, etc. But their P/E ratio has 'sustainably' risen to over 200, putting it in the 'magnificent seven'. It also 'justifies' an incredibly high P/E ratio because consequences don't matter when the downside is muted compared to the long-term upside, at least from an investment perspective.

**Elon's Fall From Grace**

Fast-forward to 2020. Tesla is on fire, but the world is hit with COVID. Whether you agree with what happened during COVID, Elon took a counter approach to his traditional fan base (and customer base) by refusing to shut down production and adopting masking. By 2022, he had acquired Twitter and began to suppress dissent, spread conspiracy theories, and exhibit erratic behavior publicly. This creates volatility in the stock, but it continues to defy the fundamentals because either they still believe in the green revolution (I like Tesla, not Elon) or they believe in the stock's investor loyalty fundamentals. 

**Today**

Today, Tesla is no longer the darling of disruptive innovation it once was. After over a decade of rapid growth, the company’s fundamentals are under stress:

* 2024 marked the first annual decline in deliveries in over a decade, falling 1.1% to 1.79 million vehicles. U.S. deliveries dipped slightly, and Tesla's growth slowed dramatically in China amid fierce competition.
* Profit margins collapsed. The operating margin shrank from 16.8% in 2022 to 7.2% in 2024. In Q1 2025, it dropped to 2.1%, the lowest in years. Net income was just $0.4B for the quarter.
* Tesla's average selling price fell to around $41,000, its lowest in at least four years, due to aggressive price cuts that failed to drive significant growth.
* Competitors like BYD have created comparable products for superior prices, and traditional brands have caught up.
* Tesla is not a leader in any particular category: they are not the most luxurious car company (Mercedes is); they are not the cheapest (BYD is); they are way behind competitors in self-driving.
* Tesla's future vision will arguably degrade its fundamental position as a car company, leaving it competing in a low-margin arena against financial juggernauts like Google and BYD.
* Early Q2 figures show a decimation in Europe and a ~20% fall in China's sales numbers compared to last year.
* Republicans are threatening to remove the tax credits that historically made Tesla profitable. 

Despite this, the stock remains inflated, trading at 250 times 2025 estimated earnings, with a forward PEG over 13, pricing in a future that has yet to arrive.

But investor confidence is unraveling:

* **Tesla insiders are fleeing:** Kimbal Musk, Robyn Denholm, and James Murdoch collectively sold over $100M in stock in early 2025.
* **Smart money is leaving Tesla:** Active institutional investors like Baillie Gifford and Soros Fund Management have pared down or exited. Index funds still hold large stakes, but these flows can reverse if passive inflows slow.
Options activity remains high, with speculative call volumes starting to create gamma-driven rallies. However, these spikes are increasingly divorced from Tesla’s actual earnings performance, with Tesla short sellers losing ~$9 billion in recent months.

The Robotaxi Narrative Remains Speculative. Tesla has committed, via SEC filings, to launching a ride-hailing robotaxi service in 2025, anchored in “unsupervised” Full Self-Driving. But the current system remains Level 2 (driver-assist), not autonomous and WAY behind competitors who have obtained Level 4. Legal filings explicitly acknowledge that no Tesla vehicle can operate without human oversight.

* U.S. federal regulators (NHTSA, DOJ, SEC) actively investigate Tesla’s self-driving claims. A defect investigation opened in May 2025 could lead to fines or forced recalls if unsupervised operation proves unsafe.

* California’s DMV is prosecuting Tesla for deceptive advertising. Courts in Germany and China have already forced Tesla to scale back its autonomy claims.

* Tesla’s robotaxi pilot in Austin is permitted not because of federal approval, but because Texas law lacks regulation. Even here, city officials demanded safety disclosures ahead of launch.

**Optimus: Faith-Based Valuation**
The Optimus humanoid robot remains entirely speculative. There are no commercial applications, no announced customers, and no revenue timeline. It functions as a narrative extension of Tesla’s innovation brand but lacks any substantiated business case.

**Conclusion: A Stock Built on Vision, Not Fundamentals.**

 Tesla's traditional stability base is cracking, and its advantage is eroding. Tesla’s stock is not a reflection of its financial health, but of its mythos. The belief that Elon Musk can defy gravity—again—and unlock trillion-dollar markets in autonomy and robotics sustains its valuation.

But that belief is now contending with reality:

* Declining sales and profits
* Regulatory scrutiny
* Insider divestment
* Flattening growth
* Intensifying competition (from BYD, GM, Ford, and others)

Should the robotaxi program fail to launch as promised, or if another recall or crash undermines confidence in Full Self-Driving (FSD), Tesla’s valuation could reset swiftly and violently. However, people are holding on to Tesla because it has consistently delivered results. But, unlike 2019–2021, there is no longer a vacuum of competition. Nor is there room to price in years of flawless execution without scrutiny.

Tesla may still surprise. Its liquidity is strong with over $37 billion in liquidity, and its Dojo AI infrastructure and energy business offer real, long-term potential. However, until speculative projects deliver verifiable results, the stock’s current pricing reflects faith rather than fundamentals. And faith, when shaken, can fall faster than fundamentals ever rise.",2025-05-23,33,25

0.91 percent

BYD:0.47 percent

China's BYD ( BYDDY ) is having another stellar year, while its rival Tesla ( TSLA ) is getting bad news after bad news.

In April, BYD's pure electric vehicles (BEVs) surpassed Tesla's registrations in Europe for the first time.

According to research firm JATO Dynamics, Tesla registered 7,165 BEVs, while BYD edged out Tesla with 7,231 registrations. Crucially, Tesla's pure electric car sales in Europe plunged 49 percent in April, while BYD's sales soared 169 percent.

Registrations are used as a proxy for sales as Tesla does not publish monthly or regional sales figures. Despite the news, Tesla shares were up 2% in early trading.

Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in the report, ""While the difference in total monthly sales between the two brands may be small, the implications are huge. This is a watershed moment for the European automotive market, especially considering that Tesla has led the European all-electric vehicle market for years, while BYD doesn't officially operate outside of Norway and the Netherlands until the end of 2022.""

Tesla's recent woes in Europe are no industry secret. Previous data has shown that Tesla has also seen a decline in registrations in key countries, including France (down 59 percent), Denmark (down 67 percent), Sweden (down 81 percent), the United Kingdom (down 62 percent) and Germany (down 46 percent).",2025-05-22,30,6

1krh3sj_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Elon Musk says Tesla, xAI expect to keep buying chips from Nvidia and AMD","Elon Musk said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, and possibly others.

Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the Tesla CEO told CNBC’s David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said. 

He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed.

“A few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips,” he said.

Last year, Musk directed Nvidia to send a large order of GPUs to xAI first, jumping the line ahead of Tesla.

At his autos business, Musk said Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems.

Musk boasted on Tuesday that xAI’s Colossus is the “most powerful training cluster in the world right now” with “over 200,000 GPUs training coherently.” Musk’s choice to build in Memphis, Tennessee, was hailed by city officials as transforming the region into a “high-tech manufacturing hub.”

But local communities there have protested the power- and water-hungry operation, specifically the way that xAI has relied on natural gas-burning turbines to help power the supercomputer.

The turbines emit smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), precursors to ozone formation, which have been associated with higher risk of death from respiratory disease.

As CNBC previously reported, environmental advocates say that xAI has likely “violated the Clean Air Act” and local permitting requirements for “major sources of air pollution” with its use of the turbines.

Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

1kpk9up_TSLA,TSLA,Forbes: Tesla Robotaxi Will Have ‘Lots Of Tele-Ops’—Which Means Supervised FSD,"Source: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/05/17/tesla-robotaxi-will-have-lots-of-tele-ops-ie-supervised-fsd/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/05/17/tesla-robotaxi-will-have-lots-of-tele-ops-ie-supervised-fsd/)

TLDR Excerpts:

\- ""Elon Musk previously stated repeatedly that the vehicles in the Robotaxi launch will be “unsupervised.” It seems likely that they will be remotely supervised, and possibly sometimes remotely driven. That would make Tesla’s demonstration much less impressive then depicted.""

\- ""Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas stated that Tesla said their Austin Robotaxi pilot will be “Invite Only. Plenty of tele-ops to ensure safety levels – we can’t screw up.” ""

\- ""... It will be invite only...It is unknown if those who ride will need to do an NDA...""

\- ""Some have speculated Musk is not telling the truth..."" (I had to add this one for laughs).

\- ""After promising that Robotaxis will be unsupervised, Tesla will probably state that they only meant that there will be no in-car supervision, so Tesla fans may not be disappointed. If there’s lots of remote driving, however, that’s a let-down because it’s not self driving, and not a product that really scales.""

In summary, avid Tesla fans and insiders will be able to get a remotely operated ride in Austin very soon. Basically, it's going to be 10 to 20 drone taxis with a driver sitting in the HQ. Most importantly, as the article says, Tesla fans will not be disappointed. I expect they will indeed go nuts.

1kpbmwl_TSLA,TSLA,"Root problem Employment Rate-- there is no market prospect for Tesla, Cyber​​CAB and all Robotaxi industry.Tesla's Second Death Knell","Many so-called ""business analysts"" and ""securities analysts"" compare Tesla's Robotaxi project CyberCAB with Uber when analyzing it, because in their perception, Uber has blown up the taxi industry, and Robotaxi will be like a warrior, blowing up Uber. But they are all wrong, because they don't understand the government's decision-making path at all. Of course, if the government is like an extreme capitalist and imperial government, such as China, then it is indeed possible. Otherwise, it is just fantasy. Because they ignore a fundamental problem, ""employment rate"".

Although Uber has replaced a large part of the taxi market, it has compensated for a large number of driver jobs, which is why the government can default on Uber's development. Although it broke the licensed taxi industry, it can provide more jobs. If Robotaxi and CyberCAB are promoted on a large scale, the government will have to face a thorny problem, and the already vulnerable jobs will become even fewer.

So when we put aside all the technological and technical issues and look at it from the policy and technical aspects, we will find that the government will not encourage the driverless taxi industry in terms of policy. I know a lot of people will say ""shit, look at WAYMO, how well it has been running"". Right, but have you noticed that from 2019 to now, WAYMO has only expanded one city, and no more expansion, think about why. Apart from technical reasons, more expansion requires more permits, and who would want more unemployment within their own governance except for a few regions.

I know that from the perspective of the Silicon Valley faction, the AI ​​faction, the Musk Mars faction, and the so-called decentralized cryptocurrency faction, this is the stupidest thing for the Earth government to artificially prevent the development of technology for the so-called ""employment rate"".

This is actually the fundamental problem, that is, the difference between the government and the enterprise. For enterprises, layoffs only need to lose money, security can be outsourced, non-essential expenses can be cut, and even employees can bring their own toilet paper to the office. But for the government, it is a completely different consideration, because it also involves the government's responsibilities and obligations to the people. Of course, if it is an extreme country like China, it can be considered less, yes, less, but it still has to be considered, pretending to be a civilized country.

So even if the United States, a country that does not have protection for pregnant women at the national level, still has to consider employment issues. Based on this, the so-called Robotaxi can only be a small-scale experiment.

Just like unmanned supermarkets, Amazon in the United States has created unmanned supermarkets, which are very popular in China, but in countries like Japan, which have the most serious aging population and need to free up young labor, they are not interested in unmanned supermarkets at all. The reason why China is so interested is that it can cheat money in the capital market. After 2016, you only need to tell investors ""I have an IDEA for an unmanned supermarket."" You can get millions of investments without even a slide or a business plan. Is anyone still talking about unmanned supermarkets now?

  
Unlike Waymo, Tesla must rely on the CyberCAB project to save its precarious car sales. Waymo does not have this burden, so it can be said that it is just for fun. No one really expects it to make money or be widely used.

1klw88v_TSLA,TSLA,Tesla’s board chair has now quietly cashed out over $500 million,"Robyn Denholm, the chair of Tesla’s (TSLA) board of directors, sold nearly $200 million worth of Tesla stock in the past six months, per an New York Times analysis of recent SEC filings.

That brings Denholm’s total proceeds from Tesla stock sales to more than half a billion dollars since taking over as board chair in 2018 — head and shoulders above her counterparts at other major U.S. companies during the same period.

The sales were executed under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan adopted in July 2024, shortly after CEO Elon Musk publicly endorsed Donald Trump for president. Denholm’s first sale under the plan took place the week after the election. She continued to sell through early May 2025, even as Tesla shares sank by double digits from their recent peak.

Denholm still holds around 85,000 shares and nearly 200,000 unexercised options, per SEC disclosures, potentially worth between $50 and $80 million at current prices.

A long arc of cashing out

Denholm, a former tech executive from Australia, was appointed board chair in 2018 as part of a settlement with the SEC that required Musk to step down from that role. Her compensation has consisted largely of stock options, some granted as early as 2014. For example, she recently purchased over 112,000 shares at $24.73 each and sold them the same day for more than $270 apiece.

The sales were legal and pre-scheduled. It’s their timing that’s raising eyebrows, especially as Musk has urged Tesla employees to “hang on to your stock” and some critics question whether Denholm and other board members are truly independent.

The New York City comptroller Brad Lander, whose office oversees major public pension funds invested in Tesla, told the Times that the optics “don’t send a message that this is a board chair who is invested in the future of the company.”

Adding to the mix, Tesla’s board compensation has a long and troubled history. A 2023 settlement of a 2020 shareholder lawsuit has had members, including Denholm, returning hundreds of millions in cash and options without admitting wrongdoing. The clawbacks have run into 2025.

The recent stock sales also come amid renewed scrutiny of Denholm — and of Musk

Early this month, the Wall Street Journal (NWS) reported that Tesla’s board had quietly explored CEO succession options as concerns grew over Elon Musk’s political entanglements and divided focus. “Board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla’s next chief executive, according to people familiar with the discussions,” per the Journal story.

Tesla and Denholm publicly denied the report, with Denholm reaffirming support for Musk. At the same time, it takes a lot for such a story to go to print to begin with, and the reporting was detailed, suggesting serious and legitimate underpinnings.

Against that backdrop, Denholm’s decision to cash out stock options while Tesla’s share price slumped — and while Musk urged employees to “hang on to your stock” — raises fresh questions about internal confidence.

Denholm’s remaining stake in Tesla represents a sliver of the wealth she’s already cashed out

The more than $530 million Denholm realized since 2018 came largely from options granted between 2014 and 2020, when Tesla’s share price was a fraction of what it is today.

Denholm and other Tesla directors haven’t received new stock options since mid-2021, when the board agreed to stop issuing equity grants as part of the shareholder lawsuit settlement. That means the compensation she’s working through now is essentially the tail end of a long, extraordinarily lucrative run, not a reflection of fresh board rewards. With Tesla’s stock down from its highs (though still extraordinarily successful over the longer term) and no new equity coming in, the value of her remaining stake looks small even as her realized gains remain massive.

1klu1vh_TSLA,TSLA,"Tesla Calls One-Time +$57,724, Buy/Sell Timing + Strategy Breakout
 138% Yield","Buy Time: May 12, 2025 10:06 AM

 Contract: TSLA 317.5C, expires May 16, 2025, Buy 50

 Sell time: May 13th, 2:28 pm, unit price $19.90

Net profit on this trade: $57,724.30 (realized)

Trading Logic Share:

TSLA broke out of the key pressure level in early May, and I started to pay attention to it after the intraday confirmation of the backing support, with a long direction.

The reason for choosing 317.5 strike is that it is stuck right at the key breakout point, balancing reasonable delta and cost effectiveness.

The purpose of using near-term options (May 16 expiration) is to eat a wave of accelerated upward + Gamma amplification + hidden wave enhancement of the combined effect.

The overall strategy revolves around short-term sentiment reinforcement + technical pattern confirmation, a fast-paced pattern that I usually favor.

Execution details:

Intervened on May 12 after confirming that the retracement was valid, with a reasonable stop loss scenario in place.

The lot size was 50, which is a heavy level only used in my high win rate strategy.

The next day, the early morning trading trend is rapid, and in the afternoon, I put up an order to sell in batches at the high level, and it was successfully sold at $19.90.

Actual results:

Bought at an average price of about $8.35, sold for $19.90

Net gain: $57,724.30, 138% return.

Screenshot of the actual transaction (see above)

Summary Points:

Don't chase high, wait for confirmation.

Gamma near expiration date is the most sensitive, with volatility explosion is the key.

Have a strategy before you dare to take a position, entry/exit should be planned in advance.

In real terms, the peak of Tesla's share price (on an inflation-corrected basis) aligned really well with the positive inflection point of its EV revenue. Across several quarters in 2021-2023, Tesla even exceeded several bullish projections and the share price was understandably buoyant. Earnings started to fall short of projections in 2024. A temporary dip before recovery to the proven track, or a sign of a fundamental problem with the earnings projections/business model?

From the 2021 standpoint, the real ""break-out"" growth was projected to occur during 2025, supported by updated / next generation EVs, robotaxi, FSD, plus all the energy storage and robotics side projects. But we don't (yet) have that.

You can see that at the scale of a year, the averaged share price is kind of following the longterm revenue projection (and of course there are loads of macro economic and fund investment effects in here). That projection has not really been modified by Tesla and I think that a lot of institutional investors can still see some potential for the take-off in profit but it is notable that we've missed EPS quite a bit now.

So what? The share price of Tesla continues to reflect old projections and is not a reflection of recent performance, nor of any kind of 'current' 5 year projection from Tesla. I think it is not in their interest to make one of those new, detailed projections right now because their share price is being helped by the old projections and blue sky/skies thinking. They continue to be able to raise capital and take cheap debt. But that may chance if 2025 is not only a miss on earnings but also shows signs of negative growth.

1kges55_TSLA,TSLA,Tesla troubles: European business is getting worse as sales slump in April,"Tesla’s ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) troubles in Europe are going from bad to worse.

The latest data out of the UK found Tesla registrations (a proxy for sales) hit only 512 new vehicles in April, per the [Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders](https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations/) auto trade group. That figure is down 62% from a year earlier; meanwhile, Chinese EV maker BYD's[ (BYDDY)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY/) registrations surged over 650% to 2,511 units.

Tesla’s UK underperformance follows weakness in other key regions. Germany’s [KBA trade group reported](https://www.kba.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Fahrzeugzulassungen/2025/pm20_2025_n_04_25_pm_komplett.html;jsessionid=FEFAC5A6CA4AC8B9AE83C7FF08398DD3.live21321) registrations dipped 46% in the country to 885. The country is home to Tesla’s only European factory. BYD saw its German registrations jump over 755% to 1,566 units.

Tesla registrations also fell in key territories like France (down 59%), Denmark (down 67%), and Sweden (down 81%), per Bloomberg data polling national auto associations. The drops in April mirror [tumbling European sales in March](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sales-tumble-again-in-key-european-regions-163357687.html) as well.

Tesla shares were down 2% in early trade on Tuesday.

Tesla bulls attribute depressed demand to the new Model Y changeover, which also resulted in a production slowdown. However, the EV maker began deliveries of the new Model Y, although only for the all-wheel drive version, in European regions like Germany in March. Whether those deliveries ramped up to a higher volume is unclear at this point. But what is clear is that the new Model Y is available for delivery.

Two factors are of greater concern to Tesla in Europe. The ramping up of BYD sales in European territories is eating into Tesla sales in several European countries. In addition, even legacy automakers like Volkswagen ([VOW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW.DE))[,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW.DE/) Ford ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), and Fiat saw sales gains in April.

The other big factor: CEO Elon Musk and his polarizing behavior. Musk's closeness to President Trump — and his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe — have had an impact on Tesla's brand. [Protests, for instance, at Tesla showrooms in the US](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/business/musk-doge-tesla-demonstrations/index.html) and abroad are ongoing. Also, owners are trading in their vehicles at alarming rates, leading to [falling prices in the secondary market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-used-vehicle-prices-are-tumbling-another-worrying-sign-for-the-ev-maker-161433870.html).

With Tesla’s brand suffering and sales sliding in Q1, Musk said on the company’s [latest earnings call](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-rises-after-musk-says-time-at-doge-will-drop-significantly-124551548.html) that he would be “allocating far more” of his time to Tesla.

That move by Musk to promise a curtailing of activity in Washington in order to increase time at Tesla’s Austin HQ comes as the Tesla board may have reached a breaking point.

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-musk-ceo-search-board-0ce61af9?mod=hp_lead_pos1) reported last week that Tesla’s board of directors was in the initial stages of a formal process to find the EV maker’s next CEO. The board, according to the Journal, also told Musk he needed to spend more time back at the company and needed to let Tesla investors and the public know he was returning.

Tesla chair Robyn Denholm categorized the story as “absolutely false,” but analysts believe the showdown between Musk and the board was “very tense” before Musk very publicly vowed to spend more time at Tesla.

Tesla shares are down 32% year to date.

My top choices right now would be AMD (30% of revenue comes from China sales, losing market share to Nvidia and Broadcom) and Nike (china concerns, plus people don't buy new shoes in recessions)?

Curious what other securities people are interested in shorting.

1kduusq_TSLA,TSLA,"Tesla sees steep sales drops in April across Europe: 81% in Sweden, 75% in Netherlands, 67% in Denmark, and 59% in France","Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA), [Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) is [feeling the chill in Europe](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/france-car-registrations-down-564-april-tesla-sales-drop-5945-2025-05-01/). Its April sales plummeted across key markets like France and Denmark, as political controversy and growing competition weigh on the brand.

In France, Tesla sold just 863 vehicles last month a 59.4% year-over-year drop and its fourth straight monthly decline. Sales in Denmark were even worse, falling 67.2% to only 180 vehicles.

Year-to-date, Tesla's France sales are down nearly 44%, compared to a 7.3% dip in the overall market.

It's not just about cars anymore. Tesla's limited model lineup is facing heat from new and cheaper electric vehicles especially from Chinese brands. But it's CEO Elon Musk's politics that may be burning hotter.

His outspoken support of President Trump has sparked protests across Europe, including vandalism at Tesla showrooms and charging stations. Many consumers appear to be voting with their wallets.

Tesla's European slump adds to a rough quarter. In Q1, the company's auto revenue dropped 20%, and net income plunged 71%, both missing expectations. April's data suggests the pain may continue into Q2.

More European data is expected soon, but for now, the signs point to a rocky road ahead especially if brand perception continues to slide.

What is omitted from all this is any mention of potential brand damage affecting these future ambitions of Tesla. If people aren't willing to buy their cars, why would they ride in their Robotaxis? The market for this tech is major cities. I don't need to show anyone a map to display that most cities in America are left-leaning. And everything ""Tesla"" is conspicuously Tesla. Consumers have lots of choices in getting a ride these days. Why would they pick a Cybercab over an Uber or Lyft? 

Lastly, Elon is terrible at math. I don't care if he is talking about saving ""trillions"" of dollars with government cuts or producing ""millions"" of Cybercabs. He is always off by orders of magnitude. I highly question his education. If he indeed earned a physics degree, he would at least be able to make projections based on reality within an order of magnitude. And he is nothing close to an engineer (I am one). His long running statement of making ""millions"" of Cybercabs is not based in reality. 

Elon's latest quote: ""*I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year...*""

Source: [Tesla doubles down on robotaxi timeline; investors enthused - and skeptical](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-doubles-down-robotaxi-timeline-investors-enthused-skeptical-2025-04-24/)

Uber, Lyft, and traditional taxis all combined have somewhere over 2 million active drivers in the US. To reach anything in the ""millions"", Tesla would have to capture almost the entire market share of all ride hailing services upon launch of their long delayed combined product and service. That is pure nonsense being put out into the Elon Reality Distortion Field (ERDF). Tesla would in fact lose money by making more Cybercabs than the market could possibly demand. The same concept would apply if they made a trillion cars without any buyers for them. Don't people even check the actual market potential for any of his over-inflated promises?   

Tesla's current ""testing"" for their Robotaxi service is just their employees riding around in their cars. It's a PR stunt more than anything else. Meanwhile, Google's Waymo is providing actual rides to actual customer in multiple cities. Elon has criticized the Waymo's design and cost, yet his Robotaxi is nowhere to be seen on the roads. He also levels this public criticism when he needs to replace something like \~4 million computers in preexisting Tesla's just to get them to meet previously promised FSD capabilities (there goes a few hundred million at least). He gets more traction for talking trash about his competitors when his own company is way behind and has nothing to show other than puffery and recalls.

What I see using the multi-year Gann fan extended from the highs of 2020 (before the breakout), to the highs Dec 2024 (488), we have been accumulating below the 2/1 resistance/supply zone (blue line) and tested this level three times (this level correlating with the daily 200ma). 

Using these indicators in conjunction with the multi-year Fibonacci sequence, you can see we are above the 50% retracement level (274.91 yellow line), indicating slightly bullish momentum, BUT we are below the 2/1 Gann angle AND below the daily 200ma, indicating no further bullish confirmation. 

That being said, these indications signify a major pivot level that would either result in 

A. Bull case: breakout and extension to the multi-year 61.8% golden ratio (325.18 yellow line) or yearly 50% fib level from ATH and recent lows (350.44 green line)

Or

1k8mm3o_GOOGL,GOOGL,Sold all my Tesla shares before the crash. Here’s why I still think that was the right call (even at today's price),"A couple of months ago, prior to Tesla correcting by \~40% I no longer believed in the thesis of their stock valuation so I sold my entire holdings. Despite my continued admiration for Tesla’s tech, from an investment standpoint, I remain bearish—and it has little to do with the political horizon. Here’s why:

**Robotaxi: A Limited Revenue Catalyst**

Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised robotaxi service in Austin by mid-2025. However, even Tesla has admitted these vehicles will require human remote monitoring to ensure safety and regulatory compliance—a reality that adds cost and complexity.

The U.S. rideshare and taxi market today generates \~$52 billion annually, projected to grow to \~$61 billion by 2029. Capturing a meaningful slice of that pie won’t be easy:

* Waymo already operates fully autonomous fleets across Phoenix, San Francisco, LA, and Austin, and is expanding into Atlanta, Washington, Miami, and Tokyo.
* Pricing will be critical—and Tesla is playing catch-up technologically.

Even if Tesla somehow captured 25% of the entire U.S. market—a wildly optimistic scenario—it would generate \~$12 billion in revenue and $1–1.5 billion in profit over a decade or more.

More realistically, even under bullish forecasts, Tesla could earn \~$2 billion in revenue and \~$200 million in profit from robotaxis by 2029.

Compare that to Tesla’s current \~$80 billion revenue base.

It would move the needle by only a few percentage points—and that’s assuming everything goes perfectly.

Bottom line: this isn't a market-changing opportunity.

**Optimus: Exciting, But Decades Away From Prime Time**

Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot is expected to be priced around $20,000–$30,000. Elon Musk recently suggested a \~$30,000 target.

At that price, most consumers would expect meaningful labor-saving ROI within 3–5 years. Tasks like:

* Cooking
* Laundry
* Grocery management
* Lawn care and snow removal

However, today’s reality? Tesla’s current robots can walk, lift small objects, and wave awkwardly—nowhere near complex, unpredictable home environments.

Critical technical hurdles remain:

* Navigating messy, human-dominated spaces
* Handling fragile or variable items
* Making autonomous decisions (e.g., fridge organization, unexpected obstacles)

Without breakthroughs in sensing and manipulation—well beyond current camera-only perception—it will be years before these tasks are reliably automated. To make matters worse, Tesla is leveraging a camera-only approach versus their competitors who are technologically superior (and not just by a bit, exponentially)—leveraging LiDAR, radar, advanced depth, force and torque sensors, advanced tactile sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Boston Dynamics is easily 5-8+ years ahead of Tesla in this technological space.

Factory deployment of 10,000 Optimus units for repetitive assembly line tasks by year-end? Possible.

Household robots folding your laundry? Not this decade.

Musk’s historic promises around autonomy make cautious skepticism wise:

* 2014: ""90% of miles autonomous in 3 years.""
* 2016: ""LA to NYC trip without a single touch.""
* 2020: ""Level 5 autonomy this year.""

(Reality, of course, has been less obedient.)

So, while Optimus could shine in tightly controlled environments, it's unlikely to drive meaningful consumer or enterprise revenue before 2030.

**Tesla's Financial Trajectory: The Red Flags**

Tesla’s latest earnings report (Q1 2025) showed:

* 71% drop in net income year-over-year
* 9% decline in revenue
* 20% drop in automotive revenue
* Significant market share erosion in key markets

Without $595 million in regulatory credits, Tesla would have posted a $189 million net loss this quarter. The underlying trendlines are flashing yellow, if not red.

**Dark Pool Moves: Insider Games?**

Since earnings, Tesla has seen an explosive increase in dark pool trading volume—private institutional trades designed to mask large-scale buying or selling.

Coupled with decreased short interest and bullish options activity, it suggests a manufactured sentiment shift rather than organic investor enthusiasm.

In plain English: insiders are moving stealthily, likely repositioning ahead of retail reactions.

**Final Take**

Given the operational, technical, and competitive realities outlined above, I do not believe Tesla will achieve new revenue streams significant enough to materially impact its bottom line within the next 5 to 7 years.

Despite exciting tech demos, neither Robotaxi nor Optimus are poised to materially move Tesla’s bottom line within the next 5–7 years. Meanwhile, core auto sales are under pressure, and financial trends are deteriorating. Short-term market maneuvers may cause volatility, but the fundamentals do not justify long-term bullishness at today’s valuations.

**Fact Validation**

I made the decision to fact check myself with ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google) and Grok (X / Twitter). Here's the fact check:

Robotaxi

\- Tesla has said they will unveil the robotaxi vehicle in August 2024, aiming for service launch by 2025. Confirmed.

\- Remote monitoring is confirmed (source: Tesla earnings call Q1 2025). Confirmed.

\- U.S. taxi/rideshare market revenue: \~$52B in 2024, growing to \~$61B by 2029 (Statista and IBISWorld confirm this). Confirmed.

\- Waymo is indeed operational in Phoenix, SF, LA, and Austin, expanding into Atlanta, DC, Miami, and Tokyo (Waymo official updates April 2025). Confirmed.

\- Your assumption of 25% capture is very generous — Uber has >70% share vs. Lyft after a decade — so 25% for Tesla is very ambitious, making your $2B realistic even if optimistic. Confirmed.

\- Profit margins in rideshare: Uber's net margin is 2–5% despite scale. You're right that a \~$200M profit is realistic at best. Confirmed.

Optimus Robot

\- Elon has stated $20K–$30K target price range (source: Tesla AI Day, reinforced Q1 2025 call). Confirmed.

\- Musk acknowledged significant hurdles, particularly in object recognition and manipulation. Confirmed.

\- Tesla’s robot demos still show very basic tasks (walking, lifting objects), no complex home task automation yet. Confirmed.

\- Tesla historically overpromised autonomy timelines (you accurately documented Musk's timeline slip-ups — bravo). Confirmed.

\- Humanoid robot scaling into assembly line tasks is plausible, household use is years away. Confirmed.

Tesla Financials Q1 2025

\- 71% drop in net income: Confirmed.

\- 9% revenue decline: Confirmed.

\- Auto revenue down \~20%: Confirmed.

\- $595M regulatory credits: Confirmed. Without them, Tesla would have posted a net loss.

Dark Pool Activity

\- Post-earnings surge in dark pool activity is confirmed (based on trading desk reports and CBOE data). Confirmed.

\- Dark pools = private institutional trading. It’s correct to infer that sudden surges often signal insider repositioning. Confirmed.

1k80bcf_GOOGL,GOOGL,Earnings Google vs Tesla,"I'm not sure if the stockmarket is broken, or just specifically Tesla. Absolutely disastrous earnings in every respect, no shortage of reddit threads ripping it apart. And yet up after hours. Alphabet smashed it out of the park, in almost every respect, and they were up about the same. But...

By the end of the next trading day, Tesla had ended up 5% (and then 10% the next day), and Alphabet just 1.8%.

Imagine if Alphabet had the same results as Tesla - they would have lost 30% of their market cap overnight.

Here’s my thesis:","""Smart Money"" if we can still call it ""smart money,"" it's certainly not buying Tesla stock right now. Institutions and market makers are well aware that Tesla’s numbers came in worse than expected. They know the numbers aren’t likely to improve in the coming quarters, especially with the looming threat of a recession, a growing global boycott of Tesla vehicles in Canada, Europe, and China, and the significant impact of tariffs on production costs.

Their strategy now is to offload their positions discreetly while encouraging the broader market—the masses—to buy in. Once retail investors convince themselves that the worst is over and start ""buying the dip,"" that’s when the so-called smart money will show its hand. By then, we could see TSLA drop below $200.

1k69czu_TSLA,TSLA,Where does the TSLA hopium come from?,"Yesterday, Tesla reported one of their worst earnings in recent years. Despite the negative downturn, the stock is somehow *up* 10%. I know everyone always says Tesla doesn’t trade on fundamentals—it trades on vibes, dreams of the future, and of course, the Elon effect. 

The bullish case on TSLA pre-earnings seemed to hinge on two things:

1. Elon would gracefully bow out of his political sideshow, and  
2. He’d unveil some new miracle product or project that could maybe resurrect Jesus himself and deliver him in a Cybertruck  

Neither happened.

Instead, Elon said he’s sticking around at DOGE until Trump’s presidency is over (specifically mentioning “another 4 years”). There was no shiny new product—just a warning of “bumps” in the road, increased production costs, and doubling down on the delay of their affordable car and robotaxi. Oh, and let’s not forget the continued brand damage apparently caused by “paid protestors”. 

So... where is this hopium coming from? **Cathie Wood’s dream journal?**

1k64yuj_TSLA,TSLA,Some Thoughts on $TSLA Performance,"In Q4 2023, the automaker reports diluted earnings of $2.27 per share. Q4 2024, we are at $0.66 per share. One quarter later in Q1 2025, we are at $0.12 per share on a diluted basis. Over this time, the EBITDA margin has remained around \~10-12%. What can we gather from this?

Tesla is aggressively capitalizing R&D and SG&A costs to the balance sheet rather than passing them through the P&L. Their earnings are actually much worse than their financial statements would suggest at the facial level today. The cash flows reveal the truth in this case... free cash flow margins have averaged below 4% during the last 8 quarters. The business is not generating new cash for reinvestment any better than their counterparts at Ford even though Ford, in this timespan, has been trying to stand up a brand new EV business where TSLA already has one in place.

My position is that TSLA is, at best, obfuscating the truth of their hemorrhaging operations to their investors. Their returns on the capital they employ within the business are, in several quarters, lower than the APY their investors could get on a HYSA. And that is without taking into account the effect of deflating the asset base by pushing at least half of what they are ""capitalizing"" in a very aggressive way back to earnings, which I feel is the most prudent way to analyze the true efficiency in this firm.

TSLA is an automaker, not a pure play software company. It isn't that the majority of their expenses can possibly be fit to be capitalized and amortized over ""X"" amount of years. This is a convenient way to hide the level of economic value destruction that is happening, but not all that difficult to uncover by analyzing the P&L and balance sheet across periods to see exactly what it is they are doing to maintain the appearance of profitability. This business, without dispute, has enormous fixed costs, and they no longer have enough sales to spread those across today.",2025-04-23,14,14

What we do not know is if they will address cratering sales and dare breathe a word of the potential negative impacts that tariffs will bring.

I think the only thing that sends the stock soaring is if Elon uses the call to publicly announce he's stepping down from DOGE and devoting 100% of his efforts to TSLA.

1k5deba_TSLA,TSLA,Delta Neutral Position and Options Activity on TSLA,"I believe many people expect TSLA earnings will tank when reported today after market hours. From all the reports sales are significantly dropping worldwide, which means they can't sell emissions credits, the brand image is tarnished, people are not renewing leases, and even turning in cars, plus they're taking a write down on BTC (when marked to market). There's more, but that's enough to set the stage. Yet somehow the stock is green today.

What I think I see. There is an overload of Put buying activity. Market makers have to buy the stock to stay delta neutral. I'm guessing this is what is driving the price up. If earning come out as expected after hours, and the stock drops, I'd expect the stock to tank Wednesday. When traders close their Put positions, the market makers will react by selling shares to remain delta neutral, effectively putting more sell pressure on the stock, driving the price even lower.

As we all know, their stock performance is often decoupled from results. Little movement in futures so far, but curious how it’ll move tomorrow. 

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

…

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

1k5g9yj_TSLA,TSLA,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

* Exports of NVDA H20 to China had been banned by the US government indefinitely, citing national security risks tied to potential supercomputing use. 
* H20 was basically the less powerful chip that NVDA had created to comply with Biden’s export controls in 2022. These H20 chips had been NVDA’s way to still access the Chinese market, but it seems that US is trying to plug this hole as well. 
* One off charge of 5.5B in Q1. This represents around 16% of NVDA’s gross margins, and wasn’t well factored in by sell side estimates. 
* News that China is reportedly open to talks if US shows respect, and they have named a point person. China wants to talk to the US on Taiwan and also the sanctions.
* There is disagreement amongst news outlets as to whether this person was speaking as an official Chinese statement. It appears, perhaps they were not.

* NVDA next support down is at 100, where there is quite strong support. 
* GOld rips higher as dollar plunges again on uncertainty amidst these new tariff measures. 
* Yesterday, we saw EU say that negotiations with the US stalled, which basically created the sell off intraday after early price action was supportive.

1jzhipc_TSLA,TSLA,How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.""

In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.

The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.

Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",2025-04-02,225,123
1jpo69r_TSLA,TSLA,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company’s stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla’s investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an all-hands session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the “best-selling car on Earth again this year.” 

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk’s political rhetoric and his work as part of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February’s elections. Tesla’s business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla’s market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla’s market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares sank 36% in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

Oh and then the FT article talking about 1.4bn red flag on their last earnings. 

When I bought my put the share price had already dropped 40% from ATH but it's PE was still ~120 and Reddit convinced me that everyone was feeling the same about their future - totally fcked and share price in free fall. Could barely find a tesla bull even in the teslastockholders subreddit. 

The next day it rose by 7% then another 5%, then stayed flat when tech fell another 3%. [TSLA vs QQQ](https://imgur.com/a/As8YeNJ)

When I bought my put I did joke to my mates ""a lot of people have lost a lot of money trying to short Tesla. I've always felt I've belonged to this gang"" but quietly hoped it wouldn't play out that way. 

Anyway the thing I'm confused by is who is buying the stock? I know it doesn't trade on fundamentals, but surely there's enough dire news out there for it to settle at a more normal PE. Is there enough money from Musk Fanboys out there to drive these price rises? Bitcoin bros? Do retail investors even form a big enough chunk of the stockholders to be doing this? are institutional.investors buying in still despite all the evidence that their sun run is over?

In some countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, they are down by aprox 60-70% in March 2025 compared to last year  (March 2024), even after Model Y changeover has finished.

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

There is currently no supply shortage, since you can order a new Model Y Juniper and get delivery almost the same day. The source for the numbers were taken from this website: [https://eu-evs.com/](https://eu-evs.com/)

One country had an increase in sales 25% (Spain).

Overall for the countries listed it was down est around 36%.

I have consistently been buying $TSLA puts every time it pumps and made decent money but guys, this time it's different. A 13% pump simply due to ""softer tariffs"" makes no sense. $NVDA and the SPY have not been moving like $TSLA this past week. Again, a sudden pump to +4% just before closing is very sus. They are somehow managing to trap the retail virgin. How can a stock skyrocket 13% literally after they announce that they lost 44% sales in Europe? When $INTC reported an 8b loss, it lost 30% valuation in 30 minutes. Intuitive Machine($LUNR) lost 50% valuation because they didn't land something on the moon, idk.

At 3:05PM I noticed a 12M BUY Volume on $TSLA on my Robinhood App. The same thing happened yesterday on closing, someone bought 2M stock. This is not retail investor, This is Elmo and 🥭 cooking up some massive scam which is going to completely cook the retail investor and us, WSB Put buyers. I have made good money buying $TSLA puts but today I have made the cumulative decision to stay away from them. 

Elmo is planning something big and our PUTS will be fucked. 

I felt that one of us must address this problem and warn the others about Elmo.",2025-03-25,4283,430

Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

1jjenqd_META,META,Thoughts on TSLA's and NVDA's moves yesterday.,"TSLA surged 11.93% yesterday to close at 278.39, then pushed strongly in after-hours trading to 282.35. From the pre-market session, stocks all opened higher with very strong buying pressure—especially during the first hour, when momentum flowed upward almost without resistance. Looking back, TSLA is truly a stock driven by sentiment, with both bulls and bears capable of causing dramatic swings. Once sentiment is in play, the price moves can be enormous. In my view, it’s likely to continue performing strongly today rather than simply pull back.



NVDA closed up 3.15% at 121.41 yesterday. Although it experienced some volatility in the hour before the market opened, it gradually moved higher with the overall market and reached a high of 122.22. However, NVDA’s upward momentum doesn’t seem particularly strong right now, and there’s significant resistance between 123 and 124, which might make a quick breakout challenging.



Additionally, META, GOOGL, and AAPL are all showing signs of bottoming out and bouncing, which could present good opportunities for a bullish swing trade. Next Wednesday marks tariff day, and in my opinion, the market may be keen to stage a big rally before then—with a secondary directional move likely unfolding on tariff day itself.

1jiqjct_TSLA,TSLA,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.

I want to start by saying a huge thank you for all the kind words, thoughtful comments, insightful DMs, and support following my previous post. Honestly—holy shit—I didn’t expect that post to blow up the way it did.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla\_short\_thesis\_and\_the\_us\_market\_house\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/)

As of the time I’m writing this, Part 1 has pulled in some pretty insane numbers:

* 542,000 views
* 774 upvotes
* 356 comments
* 817 shares

Those are absolutely bonkers, and I’m genuinely grateful for the encouragement and engagement. I’ve been a long-time lurker on this subreddit, learning quietly from many of you over the years. I never imagined that something I’d write would get this kind of traction. But some of the comments in that thread raised important questions and valid counterpoints—so I wanted to follow up with a deeper response.

Now, for those asking for charts, crayons, or simplified pictures—just a heads-up: this sub doesn’t support image uploads. So if you're looking for visual aids, you’ll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it’s worth your time.

Also, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you’re someone who can’t—or won’t—read through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn’t for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you’re setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let’s dive in.

This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/)

Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.

[https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024)

Now let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*—they're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn’t meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard—like Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them to other automakers who still rely on gas-powered cars. This is essentially free money for Tesla—it doesn’t cost them anything to generate these credits, but they can sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars.

As for interest income, this is money Tesla earns just for having cash in the bank or investments. Tesla holds billions in cash and short-term investments. Instead of letting it sit there, they invest it in safe, interest-earning instruments (like U.S. Treasury bonds or money market funds). This also include bitcoin. As interest rates rise, these earnings go up—so Tesla earns hundreds of millions per quarter just from letting their money sit and grow.

Remember what I said about bitcoin in the previous post? ""In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060) If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.""

If this number hold true, Tesla interest income from bitcoin will drop by 9.96%.

With that said, the saying that Tesla doesn't make money from car isn't true. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue—which includes income from vehicle sales and related services—totaled approximately $18.8 billion. This figure represents about 73% of Tesla's total revenue of $25.7 billion for the same period. For the entire year of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue amounted to $72.5 billion, accounting for approximately 74% of the total annual revenue of $97.7 billion. Remember the stuff about regulator credit above? These percentages indicate that automotive sales remain the primary contributor to Tesla's revenue, both quarterly and annually. Tesla is still a car company at heart, and this was it moat.

You might not know this about me, but I used to be a hardcore Tesla fanboy. I invested in the company back when they were just producing the original Roadster. Over the years, I’ve owned *every single product* Tesla has put out—including four of their vehicles.

Tesla’s sky-high valuation wasn’t just hype—it was because the company was doing things no one else dared to. It was more than just an automaker; it was positioned as a tech and AI company, with aspirations in robotics and full self-driving. But even beyond that, Tesla was pioneering a completely new model of vertical integration.

It wasn’t just about selling electric cars. Tesla popularized EVs, achieved massive adoption rates, and built an entire ecosystem around the vehicle. They sold their own insurance, handled their own repairs, created and *standardized* their own charging port (which others later adopted), and developed the most expansive EV charging network in the world.

Elon Musk wasn’t just building a car company—he was positioning Tesla to be the Rockefeller of the 21st-century automotive industry. Just like how Rockefeller controlled the oil pipeline from extraction to distribution, Tesla was aiming to control everything:

* Design and manufacturing of the vehicles
* Repair and servicing (only Tesla could repair a Tesla)
* Insurance and financing
* And the “gas stations” of the future—their Supercharger network

It was a brilliant playbook, and it echoed what made Sony so dominant in the 1990s: Sony owned the formats. Whether it was CDs, MiniDiscs, Blu-ray, or the Walkman headphone jack, Sony created the platforms and *collected royalties* when others used them.

Had Tesla stayed on that course—doubling down on ecosystem control and technological dominance—they truly had a shot at owning the entire EV industry. But somewhere along the way, they pivoted, and that vision started to drift.

I was a fanboy of Tesla, and I sold everything in November. I also started shorting Spy, but hopefully, I have time to talk about the economy in this post.

What truly broke the long-term vision for Tesla, in my eyes, was the company’s decision to step back from its charging station expansion—the very dream of becoming the next-generation energy empire, replacing Shell, Chevron, Mobil, and essentially every gas station in the world.

In late April 2024, Tesla made a dramatic internal shift by disbanding its entire Supercharger team, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. This wasn’t a small reorganization—it was a major strategic reversal. The move immediately sparked concern about the future of Tesla’s vast charging infrastructure, which had once been one of its most significant competitive advantages.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Supercharger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger)

In response, Elon Musk stated that Tesla would still grow its Supercharger network—but at a much slower pace. The new focus would be on maintaining 100% uptime and expanding existing sites, rather than continuing the rapid rollout of new stations across the country and around the world. This change came as part of broader company-wide layoffs and a growing strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and robotics.

[https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/)

For Tesla’s automotive partners—like Ford, GM, and Rivian, who had recently committed to adopting Tesla’s NACS charging standard—this sudden shift caused confusion and uncertainty. They had signed on with the expectation that Tesla would continue leading the way in EV infrastructure. Now, that future looked far less clear.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/)

As a Tesla owner in California, where EV adoption is highest, I’ve already started to see the consequences firsthand. Fewer new charging stations are being built, and the reliability of existing ones is noticeably declining. Increasingly, I encounter broken or malfunctioning Superchargers—something that used to be rare. In some locations, the charging speeds are significantly slower than they used to be—sometimes even half as fast.

On top of that, Tesla has introduced energy usage-based time rates, and the cost of charging has surged. What used to be a convenient and cost-effective option now feels like a premium-priced service. Three years ago, I used Superchargers without thinking twice. Today, I charge almost exclusively at home—because it’s five to eight times cheaper. Furthermore, you have to think about the high cost of housing and the majority of people renting or living in an apartment. They would have all had to use the Tesla charging stations for every EV car. Think about this implication!

**The bigger picture here is that Elon Musk had the chance to be a modern-day Rockefeller. He was on track to own the entire energy pipeline for electric vehicles: manufacturing the cars, selling the insurance, controlling the repairs, and operating the “gas stations” of the EV era through the Supercharger network.**

But that opportunity has slipped away. The dream of Tesla owning the entire EV ecosystem—end to end—has fractured. And it’s hard not to see this as a major strategic misstep.

u/Qc4281 ""I believe the Bulls are putting all of their hope in robotaxis and regardless of Q1, June will be the real test of how much support Tesla continues to have.""

It’s time to face a hard truth: Tesla is no longer on the cutting edge of robotaxi technology. As of 2025, the undisputed leader in autonomous ride-hailing is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company).

Waymo operates at SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning their vehicles can drive themselves without any human inside, in specific geofenced areas. This isn’t a prototype—it’s real, operational, and public.

Their Waymo One robotaxi service is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where anyone can hail a fully driverless car—no safety driver, no steering wheel input, no human control required. Riders are using it every day like a regular Uber or Lyft.

In contrast, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) is still classified as Level 2 autonomy. That means the system can assist with steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must be fully alert and ready to take over at all times. Tesla has no regulatory approval to operate a robotaxi fleet, and no Tesla on the road today can legally drive itself.

Waymo uses a sophisticated sensor fusion approach:

* Lidar for detailed 3D mapping
* Radar for object detection in poor visibility
* High-definition maps to understand complex city layouts

Tesla, by contrast, has removed radar and relies exclusively on cameras and neural networks, a vision-only system. While Tesla claims this mimics human driving, it’s also less reliable in poor lighting, bad weather, or unpredictable road scenarios. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles on public roads and released a detailed 2023 safety report showing zero major injuries or fatalities across millions of fully autonomous rides.

Elon Musk has been promising Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy “next year” since 2016—nearly a decade of delays. As of today, FSD Beta still requires constant supervision. Tesla has not submitted its system to any regulatory body (e.g., DMV or NHTSA) for approval as an autonomous driving platform. No Tesla vehicle qualifies as a robotaxi, and none are legally allowed to operate as such

Tesla can't jump straight to Level 4. It first needs to prove Level 3, where the car can drive itself under limited conditions without driver input—but even that milestone has not been reached. It’s based more on hope and hype than actual technical progress or regulatory reality. Tesla has a powerful brand, and Elon’s ambitious promises get attention—but when it comes to real-world robotaxi deployment, Waymo is years ahead.

Now we can talk about the robot. Boston Dynamics and Tesla’s Optimus are both developing humanoid robots. Boston Dynamic Has been developing humanoid and quadruped robots for **over a decade**. Their humanoid robot, Atlas, can run, jump, do parkour, backflips, and handle complex terrain. Their quadruped robot, Spot, is already being used in real industrial environments—construction sites, factories, even police and research teams.

Tesla first unveiled Optimus in 2021as a concept, with actual development starting in 2022. Still in early prototype stages—Tesla has shown it walking, lifting objects, and folding clothes, but it’s not yet capable of dynamic movement like Atlas. As of 2025, it’s still being tested internally and isn’t commercially deployed.

Boston Dynamics is years ahead in terms of real-world functionality.

I think I’ve looked into this deeply enough to respond to the common claim that “Tesla is more than just a car company.” The truth is, Tesla *was* more than just a car company. It had a bold vision—revolutionizing energy, transportation, and robotics all at once.

But that vision has faded.

Today, Tesla has lost much of its momentum under Elon Musk’s shifting priorities. Right now, it's essentially an overvalued car company that’s trying to break into the robotaxi and robotics space—fields where it's already years, if not a decade, behind the actual industry leaders.

The ambition is still there—but the execution no longer matches the hype.

Now, this isn't to say that Tesla will be going down in the next months or two. I noticed many of the people who are reading the previous post didn't understand what I was talking about when I was talking about LPSY. Specifically, I was referring to the Wyckoff distribution schematic phase c-d LPSY. Phase C is the test. The ‘Test’ serves the same but opposite function as the ‘Spring’ in the accumulation phase: the bull trap before the downtrend. While this level does get broken, it doesn’t change the picture of the cycle. Phase D is the effect. Phase D in this distribution phase is a mirror image of Phase D in the accumulation cycle. There is a considerable surge in volume and volatility, comprising one or more Last Point of Supply (LPSY) points. A Sign of Weakness (SOW) level happens, the final indication that the bears will soon take center stage. You have to open up tradingview or similar program to draw this, but it looks like Tesla is currently in that phase.

[https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/)

The LPSY (Last Point of Supply) is a critical stage in the Wyckoff distribution schematic where rallies begin to fail, unable to reach previous highs. During this phase, we typically expect to see a short-term rally, but it’s often weak and unsustainable. Volume behavior becomes a major red flag—buying volume dries up on the way up, while selling volume increases during pullbacks. This pattern suggests that institutions have already completed their distribution, leaving retail traders to buy the dip, unaware that the “smart money” has exited. As a result, the stock becomes highly vulnerable to a sharp decline.

In Tesla’s case, these signs are already becoming visible. We’re seeing a pattern of lower highs, indicating that each rebound is losing strength. Key support levels are eroding, and momentum is fading, even in response to what would typically be considered “good news.” At the same time, narrative fatigue is setting in—delays in the robotaxi rollout, slowing delivery growth, ongoing price cuts, and Tesla’s recent pullback from expanding its Supercharger network have all contributed to weakening sentiment. All of this points to Tesla potentially being in its LPSY phase, teetering on the edge of a deeper markdown.

One thing we often overlook when talking about Tesla is its status as a luxury brand, which brings us back to the broader conversation about the economy. Before I go any further, I want to be clear: I’m praying that I’m wrong. I don’t *want* the economy to crash. But I’ve lived through a recession before—and I remember it vividly.

Back in 2008, I watched family and friends lose their businesses, homes, jobs, savings—and in some cases, even loved ones. The pain was real. And what made it worse was knowing that much of it happened while our government and institutions downplayed the risks or outright lied to the public. That experience has shaped the way I look at economic data today.

Right now, I believe we're entering a recession—or at the very least, staring down a serious economic slowdown. I'm not writing this to tell you to sell all your stocks or panic. I’m sharing this because I hope you’ll take a step back, assess your risks, and plan accordingly.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is widespread and lasts for more than a few months. It typically shows up in multiple indicators: GDP, personal income, employment, industrial production, and retail sales. There's also a more technical (but less comprehensive) definition: two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the earliest warning signs appeared in November 2007, which the NBER later marked as the official start of the recession. At that time, major financial institutions began reporting huge losses on mortgage-backed securities, job growth slowed, consumer confidence dropped, and the stock market—which had peaked in October 2007—began to decline. Subprime lenders were collapsing, and credit was tightening across the board.

By mid-2008, the crisis accelerated: Bear Stearns collapsed in March, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Housing prices plummeted, unemployment surged, and the economy spiraled. If you had exited the market in November 2007, you would not have seen the S&P 500 return to the same level until May 2011. That’s 3.5 years of waiting—and that's assuming you had the ability to hold through it all. This matters because knowing when to cut losses can save years of financial recovery, unless you're okay with sitting on those losses for the long haul.

I still remember watching Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplay the risks in the housing market and broader economy. Despite clear signs of overheating in credit and housing, he failed to act—ignoring warnings from economists, regulators, and data. That experience is why I don’t place my faith in Jerome Powell or any official narrative. I trust only the numbers.

Looking ahead, the week of March 24–30 will give us key economic data. On Wednesday, we’ll get the Durable Goods Orders report. The forecast is -0.7%, compared to last month’s +3.1%. If it comes in even lower, that’s significant—because durable goods (like cars, appliances, aircraft, and machinery) are only purchased when businesses and consumers feel confident. A steep drop in this number is a classic early warning sign of a recession. However, durable goods alone don’t tell the full story—it needs to be paired with rising unemployment, falling retail sales, and declining industrial production to form a full recessionary picture.

On Thursday, we’ll see the GDP growth rate (QoQ). It was 3.0% in September and 3.1% in December. The projection now is 2.3%. If it misses expectations and drops even lower, we may not officially “ring the recession bell” just yet—but June’s data will become pivotal. That's when things may start to shift into ""oh-shit"" mode.

Then on Friday, we’ll get personal income and personal spending figures. These are crucial. If both decline, that’s another strong recession signal. Personal spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP, and if consumers stop spending, the economy slows—simple as that. Personal income tells us how much financial cushion people have. When both metrics go down, it shows growing financial stress among households.

For the week of March 31–April 6, we’ll get more insight with ISM Services PMI on Thursday, and then non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate on Friday. Forecasts haven’t been released yet, but if these numbers also disappoint—especially in combination with all the metrics above—we’ll be staring at a textbook recession setup. These are the early signs, and I’m laying them out not to scare you, but to prepare you.

You may think I’m being overly cautious, and I could absolutely be wrong. And honestly—I hope I am. But the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to risk losing 50% of your savings just to see if I’m wrong?

Looking back at 2008, throughout most of 2007 and early 2008, the Bush administration repeatedly said the economy was “fundamentally sound,” even as the housing and credit markets collapsed beneath them. In January 2008, President Bush acknowledged “economic challenges” but still refused to call it a recession. And by the time the government acted decisively, it was already too late for millions of families.

This isn’t about being Republican or Democrat. It’s about making sure the words our officials say line up with what the numbers are telling us. If they don’t—we need to learn from history and not fall into the same trap. We can’t afford to get scammed into losing our life savings again.

Let’s circle back to the topic of Tesla as a luxury brand—because that’s an important lens to view its current position through. Do you remember what happened during the 2008 financial crisis? Both automobile sales and luxury goods took a massive hit. Consumers cut back sharply on big-ticket purchases, and the luxury sector—cars, fashion, jewelry, travel—was no exception.

If you haven’t already, take a look at LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. Its stock has dropped significantly, reflecting weakening demand for high-end consumer goods. This is a telling sign. Now ask yourself—what about Airbnb (ABNB)? Another brand that, while not traditionally “luxury,” thrives on discretionary income and consumer confidence. It’s also seeing a decline, which suggests people are pulling back on travel and experiences—another luxury-like behavior.

Then there’s the VIX, the so-called “fear index” that tracks market volatility. If you examine the chart, you’ll notice that it’s starting to resemble the early stages of 2008—with rising spikes and volatility building quietly under the surface.

Some may argue that it also looks like 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a global economic shutdown. But the key difference is that in 2020, the whole world was impacted simultaneously—the pandemic was a shared crisis that brought coordinated government responses, massive stimulus, and a V-shaped recovery.

This time is different. What we’re seeing now is primarily an American problem—rooted in sticky inflation, rising consumer debt, eroding household savings, and waning confidence in domestic institutions and policy. Other countries aren't yet showing the same systemic stress.

So when we talk about Tesla, or any luxury-adjacent brand, we have to recognize that luxury spending is one of the first things to be cut when consumers feel insecure. And the signs—from LVMH to ABNB to the VIX—are stacking up. This isn’t fear-mongering. It’s pattern recognition.

Lastly—and I want to emphasize this—I'm not saying the sky is falling, nor am I predicting that the stock market is going to crash tomorrow. In fact, I actually believe the market may move upward in the short term due to momentum, technicals, or temporary optimism.

However, looking beyond the next few weeks, I believe the economic data over the next six months will begin to confirm what many of us already feel: that a recession is likely on the horizon. In particular, I think the next three months will be the most revealing. The trends we see in that window—whether in job growth, consumer spending, durable goods, or inflation—will be the “tell” that it's time for investors to start protecting their assets and reassessing their positions.

You don't need to sell everything. But you do need to have a plan. Because once the data becomes undeniable, the window to exit cleanly and safely may close fast.

Thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I had planned to dive into other topics, but honestly, there’s so much unfolding right now that it’s hard to keep it all focused. I genuinely feel for those who are still holding on, caught in the sunken cost fallacy, hoping things will bounce back simply because they’ve already lost so much.

Just remember: losing less is always better than losing more. Sometimes survival in the market isn’t about timing the top or the bottom—it’s about knowing when to step aside and preserve what you have.

As always, I welcome your thoughts, counterpoints, or insights. Let’s navigate this together.",2025-03-24,790,291

\- Tesla recalls virtually all [46,000 cybertrucks](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-46000-cybertrucks-nhtsa-says-2025-03-20/). Their 8th recall in the last 14 months.

\- Tesla is STILL after being down 50%, at a trailing 12 month P/E of 122x today March 24th. This is compared to 40x P/E for NVDA (probably a leading indicator of AI beneficiaries) and 52 p/e for BYD (probably closest electric car comparison). 

  
This is ignoring subjective truths like [Tesla being years behind Waymo](https://www.ainvest.com/news/tesla-overvalued-as-waymo-s-quiet-ride-gains-momentum-in-autonomous-race-24101010e8fcc0b6dde52a76/) in the autonomous driving division, the fact that even consumers who aren't anti Musk are worried about the stigma and damage to their cars ([it's hard to even offload a used tesla](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/20/business/even-used-teslas-are-falling-out-of-favor/index.html)), the fairly [credible accusations of fraud ](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/hundreds-of-tesla-evs-pile-up-in-canadian-parking-lots-after-suspicious-sales-rush/)in a mysterious and massive purchase of Teslas in Canada ahead EV tax rebate expiring. And ignoring the simple truth that after years of expounding the virtue of gas cars, Trump and Hannity aren't going to get conservative to pick up the slack in sales as liberals ditch EVs over musk digust. 

  
In what world does Tesla beat out superior, cheaper cars in China, overcome huge political boycotts in America, Europe and Canada, overtake Waymo in autonomous driving, all while covering their losses from a massively underperforming cybertruck and Elon doing everything in his power to both be distracted and burn tesla's reputation to the ground? The amount of growth for a company of this size would have to achieve to justify a 120x P/E is simply not feasible unless there was zero competition in a huge growing market, but even companies like Nvidia are 1/3 the P/E of tesla. 

Please poke holes in this theory. I'm biased in the sense that I am considering building a massive short position on tesla in light of these facts and would like to know what risks I'm missing, but not biased in the sense that I have a vested interested in wanting to see tesla fail.

1ji8oox_TSLA,TSLA,That 1.5% “Recovery” in TSLA is a Classic Bull Trap,"Let’s talk about what’s really going on with Tesla stock right now.

After weeks of declines, TSLA has shed 45% of its value — a selloff that should raise major red flags for any investor with a pulse. And yet, this week we saw a tiny 1.5% bump, and suddenly people are talking about “recovery” and “momentum shift”?

Let’s be real: this is a textbook bull trap, set up by institutional sellers who are looking to unload millions of shares at a better price before the next leg down.

Here’s how it works:

1. Price drops hard for weeks → retail panic.
2. Price bounces slightly → retail gets hopeful again, thinking they’re catching the bottom.
3. Institutions quietly distribute their remaining shares into that hope-fueled rally.
4. Price collapses again, retail bags are left holding the dip — again.

We’ve seen this before, and this looks eerily familiar.

Add to that the macroeconomic fundamentals that look worse by the day:

•	Sales are collapsing in Europe — year-over-year declines of 50% to 90%, depending on the country.

•	Even Fox News, not exactly a Tesla-hostile outlet, reports that sales in traditionally red areas like San Diego are down 35% YoY.

•	The supposed “EV revolution” is hitting a wall — and it’s not just the economy. Consumers are turning away, inventories are building, and Tesla is starting to look less like a tech growth company and more like a car manufacturer with margin problems.

So yes, this tiny 1.5% bounce is a trap, nothing more. It’s not accumulation, it’s distribution. The smart money is exiting, and retail is being lured in again just before the next drop.

If you think this was the bottom — think again.

Be careful out there.

1jheaxd_GOOGL,GOOGL,Tesla short thesis and the U.S. market (House of Cards) pending crash,"Hello Fellow Apes (I use this term affectionately—don’t take it too seriously),

I’ve been seeing a flood of posts about Tesla lately, and I’ll admit—I’m feeling the FOMO. But instead of just jumping in impulsively, I wanted to take a step back and explore the broader implications of what’s happening with Tesla and the U.S. market as a whole.

Now, I’m not claiming to have all the answers. In fact, I know that no one person can fully grasp the entire landscape—there are just too many moving parts. That’s exactly why we’re here: to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and grow smarter together. If you think I’ve got something wrong, by all means, correct me—I welcome it.

With that said, I’ll get straight to the point: like many of you, I believe Tesla’s current stock price is inflated beyond what makes sense for a car company. That’s not up for debate in my view. The real question is when it’s going to come back down to earth.

I think some of the hardcore short sellers may have shown up too early to the party. Yes, they’re making noise and causing some damage, but it’s still early days. The key reason? Elon and Trump still have enough firepower—both financial and cultural—to prop this thing up, at least for the short term. Between their loyal fanbases and their connections to wealthy, influential backers, they’re capable of swinging retail sentiment when needed.

From a technical perspective, we also appear to be entering the Last Point of Supply (LPSY) phase in Wyckoff distribution. That’s the stage where the stock experiences one final upward thrust before demand dries up and the markdown phase begins. We won’t be able to confirm this until after the fact, but this setup suggests there may still be one last upswing before reality sets in.

And let’s not forget how easily Elon and Trump can manufacture short-term narratives to keep the hype train rolling. For example:

1. Elon announces a new, cheaper model with an overly optimistic delivery timeline.

2. Trump announces plans to transition the federal vehicle fleet to Teslas.

3. A surprise decision is made to standardize all federal charging stations to Tesla’s NAC.

4. Suddenly, a new mandate appears—every automaker must adopt the NAC standard “by tomorrow.”

5, Tesla remains the only EV maker eligible for tax credits, while competitors lose out.

All hypothetical, of course—but not far-fetched. These kinds of announcements, even if temporary or empty promises, are more than enough to juice the stock price and keep hope alive a little longer.

But here’s the thing: this won’t work in the long run. The brand itself is becoming radioactive. Tesla is quickly approaching the kind of cultural toxicity we associate with names like “Adolf” or the toothbrush mustache. No matter how much mental gymnastics some bagholders perform, you can’t deny the rot underneath. The company has shown no real innovation, has no competitive moat, and has been delivering nothing but negative headlines for months.

9. In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter.

Going back to the whole CEO encourage people to not sell their stock, we have many examples in history that tell us this is an ""Oh Shit"" moment.

In September 2001, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay urged employees to buy more Enron shares, reassuring them that the company's upcoming quarterly financial report was ""looking great."" He stated, ""The company is fundamentally sound. At current stock prices... this seems to be an incredibly cheap stock."" Shortly after Lay's assurances, Enron disclosed massive financial losses and accounting irregularities, leading to a rapid decline in stock value. The company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, marking one of the most infamous corporate collapses in history.

In the months leading up to Lehman Brothers' collapse, CEO Richard Fuld and other top executives publicly expressed confidence in the firm's financial stability. Despite these assurances, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, marking one of the largest failures in financial history and a pivotal event in the global financial crisis.

In March 2008, Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz publicly stated that the firm was not facing a liquidity crisis, aiming to reassure investors and employees about the company's stability. Days after these statements, Bear Stearns faced a severe liquidity crunch, leading to its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase at a significantly reduced stock price, highlighting the rapid deterioration of its financial position. We're not there yet, but JPMorgan pt is $120.

Angelo Mozilo, CEO of Countrywide Financial, consistently expressed optimism about the company's prospects amid rising concerns about the subprime mortgage market. Despite Mozilo's positive outlook, Countrywide suffered massive losses due to its exposure to subprime mortgages, leading to its acquisition by Bank of America in 2008 as the financial crisis unfolded.

I’ve lived through enough so-called “once-in-a-lifetime” financial events to know when the market is out of whack—and we are definitely in one of those moments.

Before we zoom out to talk about the broader economy, I want to challenge you to look around your own community. Talk to small business owners. Ask how their foot traffic and revenue are doing. Most will tell you business is down. People simply have less money and are spending less.

You can even see the signs in the everyday stuff:

\- Less traffic on the roads.

\- Empty parking lots where there used to be crowds.

\- Local shops offering more discounts, desperate to get people through the door.

These are the subtle, everyday indicators that the economy is softening—not just in isolated pockets, but everywhere from California to Maine.

And it’s not just consumers—farmers are on the brink. Operating costs are soaring, demand is shrinking, and programs that used to keep them afloat—like USAID—are being cut. Add to that tariffs on our allies, and we’re creating a ripple effect that could drag the entire global economy down with us.

The signs on the macro level are many at the moment. For example, Consumers make up about 70% of U.S. GDP, so when people stop spending, the economy slows down. Lower retail sales, slower restaurant traffic, fewer car purchases, and decreased discretionary spending are all down. Next week. we have durable goods orders, GDP growth rate QoQ, core PCE price index, personal income, and personal spending. 

By definition, a recession is often (though not officially) defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. We won't see this for a while, but by the time we see this, there is no point in me writing this post because I will just be captain obvious. However, the thing we should look for, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and Industrial Production reports often show early weakness. A reading below 50 in the PMI signals contraction in the manufacturing sector — a major red flag. As of February 2025, the U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.3, indicating a slight expansion in the manufacturing sector. This reflects a marginal decrease from January's PMI of 50.9.

Looking at unemployment rate, when companies expect slower growth, they lay off workers. If we see an increase in unemployment rate and initial jobless claims, it would fit our thesis that our economy is getting ready to eat shit, and no amount of bullshit will save luxury goods like Tesla from the crash. As of February 2025, the U.S. unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, a slight increase from 4.0% in January.

Another key indicator to watch is the yield curve, particularly when it becomes inverted — a condition that has contributed to the strange and unpredictable market behavior we've seen over the past couple of weeks. A yield curve inversion occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, most commonly measured by comparing the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Under normal conditions, long-term bonds yield more than short-term ones because of the risks associated with time. But when investors grow pessimistic about the economic outlook, they start buying more long-term bonds (driving those yields down), while short-term rates remain elevated — often due to central bank policy. This reversal in the yield curve is widely interpreted as the bond market signaling a potential economic downturn. Historically, the 2-year/10-year inversion has been one of the most reliable predictors of recessions in the U.S., accurately signaling nearly every major economic downturn since World War II. While I’m not an expert in the mechanics behind this, I’ve been noticing that the recent yield curve dynamics are likely playing a role in the market volatility and erratic swings we've been witnessing. These sharp ups and downs aren’t happening in a vacuum — they're part of a broader pattern of uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment rooted in concerns about future economic health.

Then we have the earnings. When companies begin missing revenue and earnings targets, it can reflect a slowdown in sales and consumer demand. The next few months will be the make-it-or-break-it for the economy. So far, many larger company has been missing their revenue and earning targets--looking at you walmart and target. 

Anyway, that’s just my two cents. A lot of people have been saying that the market is acting irrationally — that the recent swings and volatility don't make sense. But from where I stand, especially when considering the actions of market manipulators and the broader economic indicators, the market actually appears very rational — just not in the way most people expect.

What we’re seeing isn’t chaos without cause; it’s a market reacting to carefully orchestrated narratives, short-term hype, and policy signals. Of course, I also believe that the government and major institutions are doing what they can to project confidence and calm public sentiment, likely to prevent panic selling and maintain a sense of stability. That doesn’t necessarily mean things are fine — it just means they're trying to delay the consequences.

For those of us paying attention, now is the time to really reflect. This moment calls for managing our risks, thinking critically, and planning how we want to move forward in an economy that feels increasingly uncertain. Whether that means reallocating investments, building cash reserves, or reassessing personal and business goals, it’s important we stay proactive rather than reactive.",2025-03-22,927,367
1jgz81h_GOOGL,GOOGL,Red Flag for Tesla that's not being discussed enough - Tesla’s Flood of End-of-Lease Returns + Falling Used Prices = Possibly big financial impact every qtr over next 5-6 qtrs,"**Long tl;dr -** Tesla possibly owns hundreds of thousands of leases of its vehicles. In Jan 2023, 8-10% of all Teslas on roads were leased. Lease assumes a certain residual value of the car at end of lease which is counted as asset. As the used Tesla prices have fallen drastically in recent months due to price cuts of new cars and reduced brand value, **IMO Tesla will take a hit of $5-10K on each car that is returned at lease end**. For example the residual price for a Model Y leased in 2023 was around $35K. Nowdays a 3 yr old Model Y is selling for around $27-30k. Across all vehicle types, assuming average hit of $7k per returned vehicle and 100k leases ending in US this year(50k of 3 yr leases from 2022 and 50k of 2 year leases from 2023), it's a write off of almost $700M



I think this could become a serious drag on Tesla’s financials. Let’s break it down:

### 1. High Volume of Leased Teslas Nearing End of Term

* These leases often span 2-3 years, meaning a large batch of Model 3s, Model Ys, and potentially other models are coming off lease around the same time. Number of leased Teslas on roads went from 8% in early 2023 to around 30% in mid 2024 - source - [kbb](https://www.kbb.com/car-news/tesla-pushes-leasing-as-sales-decline/)

### 2. Sharp Decline in Used Tesla Values

* Recent data (from sites like KBB) shows that used Tesla prices have been dropping at a faster rate than the overall used car market.
* The Cybertruck (though still relatively new on the used market) is said to have the steepest price drop, but even the Model 3 and Model Y resale values are noticeably lower than they were just a year ago.

### 3. Potential Impact on Tesla’s Financials

* IMO Tesla will take a hit of $5-10K on each car that is returned at lease end. For example the residual price for a Model Y leased in 2023 was around $35K. Nowadays a 3 yr old Model Y is selling for around $27-30k. 
* Across all vehicle types, assuming average hit of $7k per returned vehicle and 100k leases ending in US this year(50k of 3 yr leases from 2022 and 50k of 2 year leases from 2023), it's a write off of almost $700M

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

1jg4o6x_TSLA,TSLA,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

1jgdf5z_TSLA,TSLA,Conflict of interest of Asset Managers reg TSLA,"10% of TSLA or more is held by large Asset managers like Vanguard and Blackrock

What is your opinion?
What is the risk?

Here is what chatgpt AI thinks:

Is there a conflict of interest for large asset managers that operate both passive index ETFs and actively managed ETFs regarding Tesla?

Answer:

Yes, there are potential conflicts of interest for major asset managers like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, which manage both passive index ETFs and actively managed ETFs and funds. These conflicts are particularly relevant for a stock like Tesla, which is included in many passive indices but is also attractive for active strategies.

Potential Conflicts of Interest:
	1.	Passive Holding vs. Active Trading
	•	Index ETFs must hold Tesla as long as it remains in the index, regardless of valuation or fundamentals.
	•	Actively managed funds, on the other hand, can freely buy or sell Tesla based on their investment strategy.
	•	Conflict: A firm could reduce Tesla in an active fund or short-sell it while still holding large amounts in passive ETFs.
	2.	Impact of Index Changes on Stock Price
	•	If Tesla is removed from a major index (e.g., S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100), passive ETFs must sell their Tesla shares, which could put downward pressure on the stock.
	•	At the same time, actively managed funds from the same firm could capitalize on this decline by shorting the stock or buying at lower prices.
	•	Conflict: Large asset managers could potentially exploit these market flows for their active strategies.
	3.	Voting Rights and Corporate Policy
	•	Large index funds like those managed by Vanguard or BlackRock own millions of Tesla shares and thus hold significant voting power at shareholder meetings.
	•	Meanwhile, active funds from the same firms may advocate for different corporate strategies.
	•	Conflict: The same firm could support Elon Musk’s leadership through its passive ETFs while opposing it via its active funds.
	4.	Internal Arbitrage Opportunities
	•	Large asset managers have insight into both passive and active fund flows.
	•	They could anticipate when passive ETFs need to sell Tesla shares and use this knowledge for active strategies, such as short selling or buying at a discount.
	•	Conflict: If such strategies are deliberately used, they could create an unfair market advantage.

Conclusion:

Yes, there are potential conflicts of interest between passive and active funds within major asset management firms, especially for heavily weighted stocks like Tesla. The concern is that these firms could leverage market dynamics for their own benefit—whether through trading strategies, voting power, or timing of index adjustments. Regulators like the SEC monitor such practices, but there are currently few strict restrictions in place.",2025-03-21,0,6

1jfv8i1_TSLA,TSLA,Yet Another Financial Reporting Mystery at Tesla... (1.4 billion disappeared),"So, there is what the media says about this (pointing fingers and freaking out) and then there is what really happened.

So, looking at TSLA financial statements from 2024, we see they report $6.3 billion in fixed asset purchases (this is a very capital-intensive business of making cars, nothing in that alone is shocking). However, while $6.3 billion in cash went out the door, only 4.9 billion in fixed assets came back in. This, to me, is alarming for the misstatement but not for the impact. In reality, they should most likely have noted they are employing a highly aggressive expensing strategy (that's probably questionable but not illegal) or that they have losses due to exchange rates. They didn't note that, and that's a problem with the leadership and their knowledge of financial accounting which should bother TSLA investors (are the books reliable in other areas?), but it isn't really the headline it's been made out to be. This company has a history of producing financial reports which raise questions, but it has continued to be a going concern with a strong cash balance across that time...

Currently, Tesla is trading at 102 P/E and P/B at 9.9, which means that from a pricing standpoint compared to the competitors the company could fall 10x which would be dramatic.

[https://www.stocktradeiq.com/detailedData/TSLA?tab=overview](https://www.stocktradeiq.com/detailedData/TSLA?tab=overview)

**Potential**  
There are new factors that may drive sales growth like creating Optimus robots for personal or manufacturing use.

The question is how far the company might fall considering huge overpricing from current earnings and book value standpoint + the engagement of Musk in politics.",2025-03-19,0,98

1jc36c5_TSLA,TSLA,Tesla stock declines could cost Elon Musk something important,"Snippet from this article:”After a slight rebound earlier this week, Tesla's TSLA stock is back to falling, keeping with its recent performance. Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

# Markets Rocked By Economic Fear Across Wall Street

Markets had a meltdown Monday as Wall Street woke up to the reality that President Trump’s economic overhaul might not be as smooth as advertised. The Nasdaq 100 nosedived nearly 4%—its worst day since 2022—as tech stocks were pummeled. Treasury yields fell sharply as investors ran for safety, and Bitcoin slid to a four-month low. The market’s fear gauge, the VIX, spiked as recession anxiety took hold.

**Tariffs, spending cuts, and chaos**

The selloff followed Trump’s weekend comments that a “period of transition” was inevitable as his administration pushes new tariffs and spending cuts. Translation: The recession chatter might be legit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had already floated the idea of a “detox period,” suggesting that short-term economic pain might be necessary to stabilize the long-term outlook. Investors, however, didn’t seem to appreciate the tough-love approach.

**Tech stocks take a beating:** Big Tech was hit the hardest. Tesla plunged 15%, while the other Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, and Meta—fell between 2% and 5%. Investors have been unloading growth stocks since Trump’s economic policies started to materialize, fearing that higher tariffs and geopolitical instability could dent earnings. The Nasdaq’s steep drop pushed it deeper into correction territory.

**Flight to safety**  
  
Investors scrambled to defensive positions, piling into Treasuries, consumer staples, and utilities—sectors that tend to weather economic storms better. Yields on 2-year Treasury notes dropped 11 basis points as traders braced for the Fed to cut rates to cushion the blow. Energy stocks held up relatively well, with Exxon and Chevron edging higher despite the market carnage.

**Short-term pain, long-term gamble:** Trump’s economic team argues that the shakeup is necessary to “fix” the economy and reduce the federal deficit. The theory is that short-term pain—like higher tariffs and tighter government spending—could eventually force down inflation, trigger rate cuts, and even boost the real estate market by lowering mortgage rates. But that’s assuming the market holds up long enough to see the benefits. Whether this is just a market correction or the beginning of a deeper downturn remains to be seen. For now, Wall Street isn’t waiting around to find out—it’s moving to the exits.

# Market Movements

* 📱 **Apple plans major software overhaul:** Apple is preparing a dramatic update to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS this year, aiming to make the interfaces more consistent across devices. The changes, expected with iOS 19 and macOS 16, will reflect design elements from the Vision Pro and improve user experience. ($AAPL)
* 📉 **US stocks lag as international markets outperform:** The S&P 500 is up just 1% over the past six months, trailing Germany’s DAX (+20%), France’s CAC (+10%), the UK’s FTSE 100 (+5%), and the STOXX 600 (+8.5%). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index leads with a 23% gain, fueled by Alibaba’s new AI model and BYD’s EV success. Investors are shifting focus to global markets amid concerns about tariffs, layoffs, and rising prices.
* **🏠 Rocket to acquire Redfin in $1.75B deal:** Rocket Companies will acquire Redfin in a $1.75B all-stock deal, valuing Redfin shares at $12.50. Redfin shares surged 80% to $10.50, while Rocket fell 9.3% to $14.30. ($RKT, $RDFN) 
* 🚙 **Volkswagen and Stellantis avoid tariffs, BMW not so lucky:** Volkswagen and Stellantis confirmed that their North American vehicles will be exempt from Trump’s new 25% tariffs under the USMCA trade deal.

* 🚀 **Oracle forecasts strong growth fueled by AI cloud deals:** Oracle projected a 15% revenue increase for the next fiscal year, driven by a $130 billion sales backlog and new cloud agreements with OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia, and AMD.

# Tesla Shares Plunge 15%, Suffering Steepest Drop In 5 Years

Tesla’s bad year just got worse. Shares plunged 15% on Monday—the worst drop since 2020—bringing the stock’s 2025 decline to 45% and wiping out over $800 billion in market cap since December. That’s seven straight weeks of losses, the longest losing streak since Tesla’s public debut in 2010. Once the golden child of Wall Street, Tesla is now looking more like a tech stock past its prime.  
  
**Sales in Reverse:** February’s delivery numbers were ugly. Tesla’s sales in China fell 49%, slumped 76% in Germany, and tumbled 72% in Australia. UBS analyst Joseph Spak slashed his first-quarter delivery forecast from 437,000 to 367,000 and lowered his full-year outlook, expecting a 5% drop in sales for 2025. That’s a far cry from the 10% growth many analysts were predicting.

**Musk’s Split Focus Isn’t Helping:** Musk’s personal brand was once Tesla’s biggest asset—but now it’s starting to feel like a liability. As Musk splits his attention between Tesla, SpaceX, and Trump’s White House, investors are growing uneasy. His focus on DOGE and recent political antics haven’t helped Tesla’s perception either, with Google searches for ""DOGE"" recently surpassing those for ""Tesla.”

**First-Mover Advantage? Not Anymore.**  
  
Tesla’s dominance was built on being the first and best in the EV market, but those days are over. Chinese automakers like BYD are offering more affordable models with better tech, and Tesla’s price-cutting strategy seems to have reached its limit. “Tesla fired its magic bullet last year by cutting prices, but that strategy isn’t repeatable,” said Futurum Research’s Olivier Blanchard.

**Can Tesla Bounce Back?** Wedbush’s Dan Ives thinks this is a “reset year” for Tesla, but it won’t be easy. Musk’s recent attempts to talk up the stock—including his claim that Tesla profits could soar 1,000% over the next five years—have failed to inspire confidence. With falling sales, rising competition, and a distracted CEO, Tesla’s future isn’t looking nearly as shiny as it once did.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Things start off quiet this week, but the action picks up on Tuesday with the job openings report (JOLTS) and the NFIB small business sentiment index. JOLTS will give investors a fresh read on whether cracks are forming in the labor market, while the NFIB index could offer a reality check on how small businesses are holding up under the weight of tariff uncertainty.

# Before Market Open:

* **Kohl’s** has been on a losing streak, down over 54% in the last year, and it’s not hard to see why. Same-store sales keep sliding, a new CEO hasn’t sparked a turnaround, and a major debt bill looms this summer. While holiday numbers may look decent, the real concern is whether Kohl’s can avoid getting benched in the quarters ahead. ($KSS)
* **Dick’s Sporting Goods** has been putting up solid numbers, thanks to a clean balance sheet, strong cash flow, and a 2% dividend keeping shareholders in the game. This report reflects the holiday shopping season, so expectations are high—but slowing consumer spending could put a dent in future results if customers decide to hold off on splurging for new cleats.

1j7l0bv_TSLA,TSLA,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

# Tesla Sets Sights on Waymo & Uber in California Ride-Hailing

Tesla is making a serious push into the ride-hailing business, filing for a transportation permit in California—a move that could see the EV maker take on Uber, Lyft, and Waymo in a market it’s been eyeing for years.

**Not Just Robotaxis… Yet**

The permit, filed with the California Public Utilities Commission, suggests Tesla plans to operate its own fleet of vehicles rather than allowing private owners to offer rides like Uber and Lyft. But the biggest surprise? Tesla’s application mentions driver’s license and drug testing coordination, signaling human drivers—at least for now.

Elon Musk has been hyping up driverless ride-hailing for years, with plans to launch a robotaxi fleet in Texas by Juneand California by year-end. But Tesla still lacks approval to operate fully autonomous vehicles in the state, making this move a stepping stone toward that long-promised future.

**A Desperate Play for Growth?**

Tesla’s EV sales are slipping, marking its first annual decline in over a decade. With growing competition and softening demand, Musk needs new revenue streams. Enter ride-hailing—an industry Uber and Lyft have dominated for years while Waymo steadily expands its robotaxi footprint in San Francisco.

Musk has said Tesla’s fleet will eventually go driverless, but until regulators approve that, expect Model 3s and Model Ys operating much like a traditional ride-share service.

**The Road Ahead:** Tesla’s path to autonomy looks clearer in Texas, where self-driving rules are less restrictive than in California. But for now, Tesla is starting small—testing the waters before jumping in with full autonomy.

Uber and Waymo aren’t standing still either—Waymo plans to launch autonomous rides on Uber’s platform in Austin and Atlanta later this year.

Tesla’s ambitions are clear, but its path is murky. The real question: Will Tesla’s ride-hailing push be a game-changer or just another Musk promise that takes years to materialize?

# Amazon Unveils Its First Quantum Computing Chip

Amazon just threw its hat into the quantum computing arms race, unveiling Ocelot, its first-ever quantum chip. The move puts AWS in direct competition with Google and Microsoft, both of whom have recently hyped their own quantum breakthroughs.

**Quantum: The Next Tech Battleground**

Quantum computing is the holy grail of computing—offering mind-blowing speed for tasks like drug discovery, encryption, and AI development. But there’s a catch: quantum computers are notoriously unstable. Even the tiniest heat fluctuation can throw calculations off.

Enter Ocelot. Amazon claims its ""cat qubit"" tech (yes, as in Schrödinger’s cat) could slash error-correction costs by up to 90%, making quantum systems way more reliable. If true, it’s a big deal—because right now, keeping a quantum system from collapsing is about as easy as carrying a house of cards through a wind tunnel.

**Hype vs. Reality**

Of course, no one’s running Fortnite on a quantum computer anytime soon. Even Amazon’s quantum hardware lead admits we’re a decade away (at best) from real-world use cases. Google, Microsoft, and now Amazon are all racing toward quantum supremacy, but for now, this is more about bragging rights than practical applications.

**Amazon’s Endgame**

Ocelot isn’t a commercial product—yet. But Amazon’s playbook is obvious: build the tech, perfect it, then roll it out as a premium AWS service. With Braket, its cloud-based quantum computing platform, already live, Amazon is positioning itself as the go-to provider when quantum computing finally hits the mainstream.

Bottom line? Quantum computing is still a moonshot, but Amazon just signaled it plans to be one of the first to plant a flag.

# Amazon Unveils Its First Quantum Computing Chip

Amazon just threw its hat into the quantum computing arms race, unveiling Ocelot, its first-ever quantum chip. The move puts AWS in direct competition with Google and Microsoft, both of whom have recently hyped their own quantum breakthroughs.

**Quantum: The Next Tech Battleground**

Quantum computing is the holy grail of computing—offering mind-blowing speed for tasks like drug discovery, encryption, and AI development. But there’s a catch: quantum computers are notoriously unstable. Even the tiniest heat fluctuation can throw calculations off.

Enter Ocelot. Amazon claims its ""cat qubit"" tech (yes, as in Schrödinger’s cat) could slash error-correction costs by up to 90%, making quantum systems way more reliable. If true, it’s a big deal—because right now, keeping a quantum system from collapsing is about as easy as carrying a house of cards through a wind tunnel.

**Hype vs. Reality**

Of course, no one’s running Fortnite on a quantum computer anytime soon. Even Amazon’s quantum hardware lead admits we’re a decade away (at best) from real-world use cases. Google, Microsoft, and now Amazon are all racing toward quantum supremacy, but for now, this is more about bragging rights than practical applications.

**Amazon’s Endgame**

Ocelot isn’t a commercial product—yet. But Amazon’s playbook is obvious: build the tech, perfect it, then roll it out as a premium AWS service. With Braket, its cloud-based quantum computing platform, already live, Amazon is positioning itself as the go-to provider when quantum computing finally hits the mainstream.

Bottom line? Quantum computing is still a moonshot, but Amazon just signaled it plans to be one of the first to plant a flag.

# Tomorrow

All eyes are on tomorrow’s inflation data, with the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report set to drop. The core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Fed’s go-to inflation gauge and will play a big role in shaping its next policy decision.

The report also arrives at a critical moment for economic policy, as the White House weighs new tariffs. A hotter-than-expected inflation print could make the administration think twice about aggressive trade measures, while a softer number might encourage a tougher stance.

1izkzc2_TSLA,TSLA,"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?  I mean, when most companies spin off another entity, there's usually some sort of compensation, right?  Stock, payments, etc.",2025-02-27,0,1

In the past, Musk has shown that his attention can shift quickly when his companies face challenges. With Tesla losing value and Musk becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the market’s reaction, there are signs that he might be redirecting his focus toward SpaceX.

If this happens, it could be a major signal for opportunities in the space sector. SpaceX already dominates the launch market and is rapidly expanding with projects like Starship and Starlink. While SpaceX itself isn’t publicly traded, its success could boost other companies in the industry, such as Rocket Lab ($RKLB) and other firms providing technology and infrastructure for the new space race.

Musk has proven that when he focuses on something, he accelerates innovation and disrupts entire industries. Are we about to see a new boom in space stocks?

# Tesla’s Market Cap Sinks Below $1 Trillion 

Tesla’s high-flying market cap just hit a speed bump. The EV giant’s stock plunged 8.4% on Tuesday, knocking its valuation back below $1 trillion for the first time in three months. The latest drop extends a brutal 16% skid over four straight losing sessions, erasing $186 billion in market value—a hit bigger than the GDP of some countries.

**Europe Is Driving Off Without Tesla**

Tesla’s European sales crashed 45% in January, even as the broader EV market surged 37%. That’s a nightmare scenario for a company that once owned the electric car conversation. Meanwhile, competitors like Volkswagen, Renault, and SAIC Motor are taking full advantage, grabbing market share in Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands—three of Tesla’s most important regions.

It’s not just competition slowing Tesla down. The Model Y is undergoing a refresh, meaning some buyers are hitting pause on purchases. And then there’s Elon Musk’s political baggage—his rumored backing of Germany’s far-right AfD party hasn’t exactly helped Tesla’s brand in Europe.

**Musk’s Political Distractions Are Spilling Into Tesla’s Stock**  
  
Beyond sales troubles, investors are increasingly worried about Musk’s extracurricular activities. His role in Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is causing a stir, with protesters swarming Tesla stores and charging stations over Musk’s influence on government job cuts. Critics argue he’s spending too much time in Washington and not enough time fixing Tesla’s growing list of problems.

**China’s Not Bailing Tesla Out Either:** Over in China, Tesla’s big upgrade to its self-driving system landed with a thud. Disappointed users say the company overpromised and underdelivered, while competitors like BYD and Xiaomi are offering better driver-assist tech at a fraction of the cost. That’s not the kind of differentiation Tesla needs in its second-largest market.

What’s Next for Tesla?With the stock down 25% in 2025, Tesla has now claimed the title of the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” stock—not exactly the trophy Wall Street expected. Between slumping sales, aggressive competition, and Musk’s political distractions, Tesla’s future isn’t as autopilot-friendly as investors once thought. The question now: Can Musk shift his focus back to the road before Tesla’s stock takes another wrong turn?

**Lucid’s CEO Steps Down as EV Maker Tries to Recharge**

Lucid just swapped drivers. CEO Peter Rawlinson is stepping down, with COO Marc Winterhoff sliding into the interim role as the company hunts for a permanent replacement. The shake-up comes as Lucid looks to double production in 2025, hoping the new Gravity SUV can supercharge demand. The EV maker still isn’t profitable, but investors didn’t seem to mind—shares jumped 8.8% in after-hours trading. ($LCID)  
  
EPS: -$0.22, a smaller loss than the expected -$0.25  
Revenue: $234.5 million, cruising past estimates of $214 million

**Cava’s Growth Outlook Fails to Sizzle**

Cava just got served a reality check. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain’s 2025 sales forecast fell short of expectations, sending shares up 2.71% after hours. Same-store sales are expected to rise between 6% and 8%, but analysts were hoping for something juicier. Even a strong Q4, featuring a 21% same-store sales pop, wasn’t enough to ease concerns. With no more price hikes planned, Cava’s hoping new locations and menu additions can keep customers coming back. ($CAVA) 

EPS: In line with estimates  
Revenue: Matched forecasts

**Home Depot’s Sales Turn Positive, Stock Gets a Lift**

The home improvement giant credited shoppers spending more per trip, but big-ticket renovations are still gathering dust. Full-year guidance came in light, with management bracing for a slow housing market recovery. Still, investors saw enough to believe Home Depot is stabilizing after a rough couple of years. ($HD)

EPS: $3.02, a hair above the expected $3.01  
Revenue: $39.70 billion, edging past forecasts of $39.16 billion

**Workday Jumps as AI Hype Powers Earnings Beat**

AI is paying off for Workday, which saw its stock surge over 10% after crushing earnings expectations. Revenue climbed 15% year over year, with AI tools now a key part of nearly a third of customer expansions. The company also boosted its full-year margin outlook, giving investors confidence in its long-term profitability. As AI adoption ramps up in enterprise software, Workday is proving it has a seat at the table. ($WDAY)

EPS: $1.92, easily topping estimates of $1.78

1iq409q_TSLA,TSLA,Holding TSLA and PLTR.. am I an idiot?,"Hey everyone, torn between what to do here. 

I’m 29 and have about 800K in net worth (about 770K invested across brokerage/retirement accounts. 

The majority is in VOO (about 500K) - but I have about 150K in TSLA (100%+ gains) and 100K in PLTR (400% gains). 

One side of me is thinking to sell about half of each and move it into VOO and chill. The other side, has so much belief in TSLA and PLTR for the next 5-10 years, I want to hold and see where it goes. Deciding whether to play it safer, or really go for it. I just want me and my wife to retire early 😭 

Curious to what ya’ll would do in my case. Thanks!

1iq3s4q_TSLA,TSLA,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won’t crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don’t want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won’t let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won’t be cheap.

Disclosure: I don’t have any positions on TSLA at this point.

# Tesla Drops After BYD Partners With DeepSeek

Tesla just can’t catch a break. Shares tumbled 6% on Tuesday, extending a five-day losing streak that’s erased over $200 billion in market value. The latest blow came from Chinese EV giant BYD, which announced a partnership with DeepSeek to roll out advanced driver-assistance tech across nearly all of its new models—at no extra cost. While Tesla is still charging $99/month for its Full Self-Driving software (which requires constant supervision), BYD is handing out self-driving capabilities like Oprah giving away cars. The move underscores just how much Tesla’s dominance in AI-powered driving is slipping.

**Musk’s Side Quest: OpenAI**

If that wasn’t enough, Musk is back in the spotlight for yet another outside venture—this time leading a $97.4 billion bid to take over OpenAI. While Tesla has rebranded itself as a “physical AI” company, analysts are questioning whether Musk’s latest distraction is helping or hurting. Oppenheimer analysts weren’t shy about their concerns, calling the move a “distraction from Tesla’s challenges” at a time when competition in the EV space is heating up. Meanwhile, Waymo is quietly expanding its robotaxi service, securing a key edge in autonomous driving while Tesla remains stuck in regulatory limbo.

**The Market’s Verdict**

Morgan Stanley is still bullish on Tesla, setting a $430 price target, but the broader sentiment is shifting. Oppenheimer warns that rising competition from BYD and other AI-driven automakers could squeeze Tesla’s future profits. Even Tesla’s longtime advantage—brand power—is showing cracks, with vehicle registrations dropping sharply in key markets like California and Europe.

**Bottom Line**

Tesla is facing a two-front war: competition from Chinese automakers slashing prices and rolling out superior tech, and Musk’s ever-growing list of side projects pulling his attention away from the company that made him a household name. Investors aren’t panicking just yet, but as Tesla’s once-dominant AI edge erodes, the clock is ticking on how long it can hold its lead.

# Elliott Turns Up the Heat on Phillips 66

Activist investor Elliott Investment Management is back at it, this time taking aim at oil refiner Phillips 66. After increasing its stake to over $2.5 billion, Elliott is demanding the company sell or spin off its pipeline business, arguing that the move could fetch a valuation north of $40 billion. The firm, known for its aggressive shakeups, also wants new independent board members and a tighter focus on refining.

**The Case for a Split**

Phillips 66 has been under pressure since Elliott first got involved in 2023, when it revealed a $1 billion stake and pushed for operational improvements. While the company has made some concessions—like selling $2.7 billion in assets and adding one Elliott-backed board member—the activist firm argues that progress has been too slow. Phillips 66’s stock is down roughly 11% over the past year, lagging behind broader market gains of 21%, making Elliott’s call for change more urgent.

**Elliott’s Track Record**

Elliott isn’t new to the energy sector. The firm has successfully pressured companies like Suncor and Hess to streamline operations and boost shareholder returns. And Phillips 66 isn’t the only oil giant in its crosshairs—reports suggest Elliott has also built a stake in BP, urging it to double down on oil and gas instead of its broader green energy push.

So far, Phillips 66 is playing it cool. The company insists it’s “on the right path” and points to strong 2024 results as proof. But with Elliott now one of its top five shareholders and the activist’s influence growing across the industry, the pressure to make big changes isn’t going away.

**Bottom Line:** Elliott’s push for Phillips 66 to offload its pipeline business isn’t just about unlocking value—it’s about forcing the company to rethink its entire strategy. But Elliott isn’t known for making empty threats—if Phillips 66 drags its feet, expect the activist to escalate its campaign, potentially pushing for boardroom changes or a leadership shake-up. Either management moves or Elliott forces their hand.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s main event: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.

This inflation gauge tracks price changes across everything from groceries to gas, but all eyes are on car prices, which have stayed stubbornly high. Economists expect inflation to hold steady, with a 0.3% monthly bump in January, keeping the annual rate at 2.9%. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) is also forecasted to rise 0.3% month-over-month, landing at 3.1% for the year.

While CPI will dominate headlines, earnings season isn’t taking a backseat. Heavy hitters like CVS Health ($CVS), Vertiv Holdings ($VRT), Kraft Heinz ($KHC), Barrick Gold ($GOLD), Dominion Energy ($D), CME Group ($CME), and Dutch Bros ($BROS) are all set to report.

# After Market Close:

Analysts expect a strong quarter, with consensus calling for $0.53 EPS on $930.22 million in revenue. ($HOOD) 
* **Reddit** is Wall Street’s new social media darling, with shares skyrocketing 395% since its March 2024 IPO. A lucrative AI deal with Alphabet and its dominance in real search results (just add “Reddit” to a Google query) have fueled massive revenue growth. The valuation looks stretched, but after consistently crushing expectations, shorting this one might not be the smartest move. Consensus: $0.23 EPS, $403.15 million in revenue.

Tesla’s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I’m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here’s a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk’s PR Nightmare** – It’s hard to ignore how much Musk’s public image has deteriorated. Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.

As a novice investor, I bought Palantir (PLTR) during its initial public offering and made a profit. After each earnings report, Morningstar kept increasing the company's fair value estimate up to $32. Then suddenly, the value dropped to $7-8. This coincided with a change in analyst coverage, and they initiated new coverage with a fair value around $9. 

Now that the stock has skyrocketed due to market enthusiasm, I checked their analysis again. I notice they've changed analysts once more, and the fair value has been dramatically revised to $90. I find this difficult to comprehend. While I highly respect Morningstar, I struggle to understand how they can justify such a valuation.

A similar situation occurred with Tesla. Morningstar advised avoiding Tesla in 2019-2020, but now they've set its fair value at $250. These dramatic shifts in valuation estimates make me question their consistency.",2025-02-08,24,36

1ik5337_TSLA,TSLA,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"China Is Moving On from Tesla  
  
Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

1ig6a7k_TSLA,TSLA,TSLA Earnings and How It May Be Bullish for CLSK,"NEWS: TSLA earnings were SAVED by the FASB reporting change which allowed reporting BTC price at market value of 12/31/2024 ($93.3k per BTC) on Q1 2025 reports. Unlike MSTR which may be subject to tax issues, ChatGPT says this same FASB rule change will help BTC miners like CLSK improve accounting presentation for their own BTC holdings.

I will be HOLDING CLSK throughout this week's riffraff. Current EPS projections likely do not account for $93.3k per BTC mined so a lot of bears are in for a rude awakening when earnings come out. Shorters may likely begin selling their hedged BTC to buy and hold CLSK. The sooner retail realizes this, the sooner shorts will cover.

BTC price this week has NO effect on CLSK Q1 2025 earnings. Ignore FUD and DO RESEARCH. You have the world's info at your fingertips. CLSK beat growth targets and hit 39 EH/s by EOY. CLSK is growing with liquid cooled S21 XP's which stay cooler and thus require less maintenance/fixing (less payroll per EH/s).

EPS may be likely to beat projections. The market is fickle but NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. Look, it's been tough holding CLSK this year but the one thing I know is to never trust emotions. The fact that mining is so cutthroat is partly why only the most efficient like CLSK will be able to make it.

You could Throw in Cisco which has a monopoly over and controls about 66% of the cell phone networking hardware industry in American and it will still be roughly the same.

Tesla is not outpacing other companies, other companies are actually catching up to them in the ways they have been growing.

Also, keep in mind that Musk just pissed off about 50 million democrats who were Tesla's existing core customer base. Multiple people at my work who own Tesla's have said they are now embarrassed to own a Tesla.

The speculation is partly based on Tesla's currently nonexistent and delayed automated taxi company. Let's put how weak Tesla's position in perspective.

Tesla plans to open an automated taxi company in Austin Texas this summer. 1 city.  Waymo (owned by Google) started in it's first city 8 years ago and is planning on expanding from 3 cities (San Fransisco, LA, and Pheonix) to 12 over the next year. Tesla is almost a decade behind in this industry and are not in a good position to dominate it or reach fully non city dependent fully automated driving in any way. There is also absolutely no indication that their business model is in a better position than their competitors in this industry currently.

For this current Market cap to be realized, Tesla would essentially need to come to control the majority of 3 major industries while Musk is sitting around playing video games for 12 hours a day (according to him) and playing politician in the Trump administration.",2025-01-31,861,286

# Tesla Fourth-Quarter Results Miss Estimates As Automotive Revenue Drops 8%

Tesla’s Q4 results weren’t exactly electric—profits missed estimates, automotive revenue fell 8%, and margins shrank to 6.2%. But none of that mattered once Elon Musk started talking about Tesla’s glorious future. The stock initially dipped, then flipped positive after Musk reassured investors that 2025 will be the year Tesla returns to growth. With plans for a cheaper EV, self-driving tech, and even humanoid robots, Musk essentially told Wall Street: “Ignore the numbers, focus on the dream.”

**Self-Driving Hype and a White House Connection**  
  
Musk is doubling down on AI, telling investors that fully autonomous Teslas will hit the streets this year and that the Cybercab—a driverless taxi—will arrive in 2026. Meanwhile, his growing influence in Washington could shape Tesla’s trajectory. As one of Trump’s key advisors, Musk has a front-row seat to potential regulatory shifts that could benefit his AI and self-driving ambitions. However, Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports could dent Tesla’s bottom line, given its supply chain reliance on both countries.

**Investors Are Betting on the Vision, Not the Numbers**  
  
Despite rising competition and an aging product lineup, Tesla’s market value has soared post-election, driven by optimism around Musk’s political clout. But reality looms: margins are shrinking, demand is softening, and price wars—especially in China—aren’t letting up. Tesla still holds a dominant position in the EV market, but it needs more than hype to maintain its $1.5 trillion valuation.

**2025, Make or Break for Tesla:** Musk insists Tesla will be “ridiculously good” by 2027, but investors won’t wait that long. The next 12 months will be critical, with cheaper EVs expected to revive demand, and self-driving tech facing regulatory and technological hurdles. For now, Tesla remains a high-stakes bet on Musk’s ability to turn grand visions into reality—and avoid getting lost in his own hype.

# Big Tech’s AI Binge: Meta Bets Big, Microsoft Hits a Wall

**Zuckerberg’s AI Ambitions Hype Up Investors**  
  
Mark Zuckerberg is on a mission to make Meta the AI kingpin. During Meta’s Q4 earnings call, he predicted that 2025 would be the year Meta AI reaches a billion people and that its AI engineering agents would rival mid-level software engineers. Despite a weaker-than-expected Q1 revenue forecast, the stock climbed 4.5% after hours as investors rallied behind Zuck’s AI-fueled optimism. Meta’s ad business remains strong, with Q4 revenue beating expectations at $48.4 billion, even as the company prepares to slash 5% of its workforce to “make space for new hires.”

**Microsoft’s AI Boom Faces a Data Center Bottleneck**  
  
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s AI-powered growth is hitting a roadblock—there simply aren’t enough data centers to keep up with demand. While Azure AI services surged 157%, the company warned that cloud growth would remain sluggish until it expands capacity. That cautious outlook sent Microsoft’s stock down 5% in extended trading, despite Q4 revenue of $69.6 billion, slightly ahead of estimates. CFO Amy Hood reassured investors that the bottleneck should ease by the end of the fiscal year, but Wall Street remains skeptical of its $80 billion AI infrastructure investment.

**The DeepSeek Disruption**  
  
Both Meta and Microsoft are plowing billions into AI, but a Chinese startup just threw a wrench into their plans. DeepSeek’s latest AI model claims to rival the best of U.S. tech at a fraction of the cost, sparking a $1 trillion market wipeout earlier this week. While Meta was spared from the carnage, analysts are questioning whether its $65 billion AI spending spree is visionary or just bloated. Microsoft, already struggling to monetize its AI push, now faces growing pressure to prove that its massive capital outlays will pay off.

**AI Dreams vs. Investor Reality:** Both tech giants are betting their futures on AI, but execution is everything. Meta is using AI to supercharge its ad business and roll out new consumer-facing tools, while Microsoft’s AI dominance hinges on fixing its cloud supply crunch. With investors growing impatient for returns, the real question is whether these AI moonshots will turn into sustainable profits—or just expensive hype.

# Fed Hits the Pause Button

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: interest rates aren’t going anywhere—for now. While traders were itching for a March rate cut, Powell’s message was more “let’s wait and see” than “get ready for liftoff.” The Fed wants proof inflation is truly under control before it starts easing, with Powell repeating (more than once) that policymakers need to see “serial readings” of cooling prices. Translation? The Fed isn’t convinced yet, and rate cuts might not come until June or later.

**Trump vs. Powell: Round Two?**  
  
If you thought Trump and the Fed’s rocky relationship ended in 2020, think again. The former—and now current—president wasted no time slamming Powell on Truth Social, blaming him for past inflation woes and making it clear he wants rates slashed ASAP. Powell, unfazed, reiterated that the Fed’s decisions are driven by data, not presidential tweets.

**Markets Take a Step Back**  
  
Investors weren’t thrilled. Stocks dipped, Treasury yields popped, and futures traders quickly adjusted expectations, pushing back bets on the first rate cut to June instead of March. While Powell didn’t slam the door on cuts this year, he also didn’t give the markets the green light they were hoping for. With inflation still hovering above the Fed’s 2% target and the economy chugging along, Powell isn’t in a rush to make moves.

**Looking Ahead:** The next big test? Inflation data in the coming months. If price pressures keep cooling, the Fed might start cutting sooner. But if Trump’s policies stir up inflationary headaches, Powell could be forced to keep rates higher for longer. Either way, expect more market drama as the Fed and the White House navigate what’s shaping up to be a bumpy economic ride.

# Tesla Fourth-Quarter Results Miss Estimates As Automotive Revenue Drops 8%

Tesla’s Q4 results weren’t exactly electric—profits missed estimates, automotive revenue fell 8%, and margins shrank to 6.2%. But none of that mattered once Elon Musk started talking about Tesla’s glorious future. The stock initially dipped, then flipped positive after Musk reassured investors that 2025 will be the year Tesla returns to growth. With plans for a cheaper EV, self-driving tech, and even humanoid robots, Musk essentially told Wall Street: “Ignore the numbers, focus on the dream.”

**Self-Driving Hype and a White House Connection**  
  
Musk is doubling down on AI, telling investors that fully autonomous Teslas will hit the streets this year and that the Cybercab—a driverless taxi—will arrive in 2026. Meanwhile, his growing influence in Washington could shape Tesla’s trajectory. As one of Trump’s key advisors, Musk has a front-row seat to potential regulatory shifts that could benefit his AI and self-driving ambitions. However, Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports could dent Tesla’s bottom line, given its supply chain reliance on both countries.

**Investors Are Betting on the Vision, Not the Numbers**  
  
Despite rising competition and an aging product lineup, Tesla’s market value has soared post-election, driven by optimism around Musk’s political clout. But reality looms: margins are shrinking, demand is softening, and price wars—especially in China—aren’t letting up. Tesla still holds a dominant position in the EV market, but it needs more than hype to maintain its $1.5 trillion valuation.

**2025, Make or Break for Tesla:** Musk insists Tesla will be “ridiculously good” by 2027, but investors won’t wait that long. The next 12 months will be critical, with cheaper EVs expected to revive demand, and self-driving tech facing regulatory and technological hurdles. For now, Tesla remains a high-stakes bet on Musk’s ability to turn grand visions into reality—and avoid getting lost in his own hype.

# Big Tech’s AI Binge: Meta Bets Big, Microsoft Hits a Wall

**Zuckerberg’s AI Ambitions Hype Up Investors**  
  
Mark Zuckerberg is on a mission to make Meta the AI kingpin. During Meta’s Q4 earnings call, he predicted that 2025 would be the year Meta AI reaches a billion people and that its AI engineering agents would rival mid-level software engineers. Despite a weaker-than-expected Q1 revenue forecast, the stock climbed 4.5% after hours as investors rallied behind Zuck’s AI-fueled optimism. Meta’s ad business remains strong, with Q4 revenue beating expectations at $48.4 billion, even as the company prepares to slash 5% of its workforce to “make space for new hires.”

**Microsoft’s AI Boom Faces a Data Center Bottleneck**  
  
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s AI-powered growth is hitting a roadblock—there simply aren’t enough data centers to keep up with demand. While Azure AI services surged 157%, the company warned that cloud growth would remain sluggish until it expands capacity. That cautious outlook sent Microsoft’s stock down 5% in extended trading, despite Q4 revenue of $69.6 billion, slightly ahead of estimates. CFO Amy Hood reassured investors that the bottleneck should ease by the end of the fiscal year, but Wall Street remains skeptical of its $80 billion AI infrastructure investment.

**The DeepSeek Disruption**  
  
Both Meta and Microsoft are plowing billions into AI, but a Chinese startup just threw a wrench into their plans. DeepSeek’s latest AI model claims to rival the best of U.S. tech at a fraction of the cost, sparking a $1 trillion market wipeout earlier this week. While Meta was spared from the carnage, analysts are questioning whether its $65 billion AI spending spree is visionary or just bloated. Microsoft, already struggling to monetize its AI push, now faces growing pressure to prove that its massive capital outlays will pay off.

**AI Dreams vs. Investor Reality:** Both tech giants are betting their futures on AI, but execution is everything. Meta is using AI to supercharge its ad business and roll out new consumer-facing tools, while Microsoft’s AI dominance hinges on fixing its cloud supply crunch. With investors growing impatient for returns, the real question is whether these AI moonshots will turn into sustainable profits—or just expensive hype.

# 

# Fed Hits the Pause Button

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: interest rates aren’t going anywhere—for now. While traders were itching for a March rate cut, Powell’s message was more “let’s wait and see” than “get ready for liftoff.” The Fed wants proof inflation is truly under control before it starts easing, with Powell repeating (more than once) that policymakers need to see “serial readings” of cooling prices. Translation? The Fed isn’t convinced yet, and rate cuts might not come until June or later.

**Trump vs. Powell: Round Two?**  
  
If you thought Trump and the Fed’s rocky relationship ended in 2020, think again. The former—and now current—president wasted no time slamming Powell on Truth Social, blaming him for past inflation woes and making it clear he wants rates slashed ASAP. Powell, unfazed, reiterated that the Fed’s decisions are driven by data, not presidential tweets.

**Markets Take a Step Back**  
  
Investors weren’t thrilled. Stocks dipped, Treasury yields popped, and futures traders quickly adjusted expectations, pushing back bets on the first rate cut to June instead of March. While Powell didn’t slam the door on cuts this year, he also didn’t give the markets the green light they were hoping for. With inflation still hovering above the Fed’s 2% target and the economy chugging along, Powell isn’t in a rush to make moves.

**Looking Ahead:** The next big test? Inflation data in the coming months. If price pressures keep cooling, the Fed might start cutting sooner. But if Trump’s policies stir up inflationary headaches, Powell could be forced to keep rates higher for longer. Either way, expect more market drama as the Fed and the White House navigate what’s shaping up to be a bumpy economic ride.

# Tesla Debuts New Model Y in US, Europe in Bid to Revive Sales

Tesla is hitting the reset button on its best-selling Model Y, debuting a revamped version in the U.S. and Europe with hopes of reversing its first annual sales drop in over a decade. The refresh brings updates like Cybertruck-inspired light bars, soundproofed interiors, and a range of 320 miles. But at $59,990, it's a premium gamble—one that Elon Musk seems confident will pay off, even in a turbulent EV market.

**What’s New Under the Hood?**  
  
The ""Juniper"" Model Y comes with fresh aesthetics, tech upgrades like rear-seat touchscreens, and faster Wi-Fi, but it’s not just a facelift. The refreshed SUV now touts a zippier 0-60 mph time of 4.1 seconds, giving it a slight edge in performance. While the base model remains, the “Launch Series” version—packed with features like Full Self-Driving—is Tesla’s bold bet to woo customers willing to shell out extra for cutting-edge convenience.

**A Pricey Predicament**  
  
The updated price tag, roughly $4,000 more than its predecessor, might be a tough sell. With EV demand cooling and higher interest rates pinching consumer wallets, Tesla’s bet on premium features will test whether its loyal fanbase will dig deeper into their pockets. Add in the looming repeal of federal EV tax credits under Trump’s new administration, and the stakes for the Model Y refresh couldn’t be higher.  
  
Tesla’s upcoming earnings report will reveal whether this redesign can jumpstart sales. Investors will also be on the lookout for updates on the long-rumored “Model 2,” Tesla’s anticipated budget-friendly EV. With Musk targeting sales growth of 20–30% in 2025, all roads seem to lead to more affordable options for expanding the EV giant's reach.

**The Bigger Picture:** Tesla’s refresh is as much about optics as it is about specs. The EV pioneer faces mounting competition from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers leaning into the EV space. Whether the new Model Y can fend off rivals and keep Tesla’s dominance alive will hinge on its ability to balance innovation with affordability—a feat easier said than done.

For now, the Model Y refresh signals that Tesla isn’t just coasting; it’s steering into the future, albeit at a premium price.

# Meta's $65 Billion AI Bet: Zuckerberg Goes All-In

Mark Zuckerberg is putting Meta’s chips—actually, 1.3 million GPUs worth—on artificial intelligence, with plans to invest up to $65 billion in 2025. This spending spree includes a Manhattan-sized data center, a hiring boost for AI teams, and enough computing power to make the sci-fi nerds blush. The tech giant isn’t just flexing; it’s making a play to dominate the next era of innovation.

**A Data Center the Size of Ambition**  
  
Meta’s new Louisiana data center is so massive it could ""cover a significant part of Manhattan,"" according to Zuckerberg. With a gigawatt of computing power set to come online next year, Meta is preparing to turbocharge its AI capabilities. The timing aligns with a broader arms race among tech titans, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet also throwing billions at AI infrastructure.

**Can AI Investments Keep Investors Happy?**  
  
While Wall Street had expected Meta to spend around $51 billion on capex in 2025, the additional $14 billion caught some off guard. Yet, analysts see the move as bold but potentially brilliant, arguing it positions Meta to lead in AI innovation. Shares initially dipped but recovered, with the stock closing at an all-time high of $647.49 on Friday.

**The Bigger Picture**  
  
Zuckerberg isn’t shy about the risks. He’s acknowledged the possibility of overbuilding but believes missing out on AI would be a bigger blunder. ""The downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for the next 10–15 years,"" he said. With a track record of making high-stakes bets that pay off (hello, Instagram acquisition), the gamble could redefine how Meta operates—and how we interact with technology.

**What’s Next?** As Meta gears up for its Q4 earnings on Jan. 29, investors will be looking for more details on these grandiose AI plans. If Zuckerberg’s bets pay off, Meta might not just own the metaverse—it could be the backbone of tomorrow’s AI-driven economy.

The updated price tag, roughly $4,000 more than its predecessor, might be a tough sell. With EV demand cooling and higher interest rates pinching consumer wallets, Tesla’s bet on premium features will test whether its loyal fanbase will dig deeper into their pockets. Add in the looming repeal of federal EV tax credits under Trump’s new administration, and the stakes for the Model Y refresh couldn’t be higher.  
  
Tesla’s upcoming earnings report will reveal whether this redesign can jumpstart sales. Investors will also be on the lookout for updates on the long-rumored “Model 2,” Tesla’s anticipated budget-friendly EV. With Musk targeting sales growth of 20–30% in 2025, all roads seem to lead to more affordable options for expanding the EV giant's reach.

**The Bigger Picture:** Tesla’s refresh is as much about optics as it is about specs. The EV pioneer faces mounting competition from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers leaning into the EV space. Whether the new Model Y can fend off rivals and keep Tesla’s dominance alive will hinge on its ability to balance innovation with affordability—a feat easier said than done.

For now, the Model Y refresh signals that Tesla isn’t just coasting; it’s steering into the future, albeit at a premium price.

# Meta's $65 Billion AI Bet: Zuckerberg Goes All-In

Mark Zuckerberg is putting Meta’s chips—actually, 1.3 million GPUs worth—on artificial intelligence, with plans to invest up to $65 billion in 2025. This spending spree includes a Manhattan-sized data center, a hiring boost for AI teams, and enough computing power to make the sci-fi nerds blush. The tech giant isn’t just flexing; it’s making a play to dominate the next era of innovation.

**A Data Center the Size of Ambition**  
  
Meta’s new Louisiana data center is so massive it could ""cover a significant part of Manhattan,"" according to Zuckerberg. With a gigawatt of computing power set to come online next year, Meta is preparing to turbocharge its AI capabilities. The timing aligns with a broader arms race among tech titans, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet also throwing billions at AI infrastructure.

**Can AI Investments Keep Investors Happy?**  
  
While Wall Street had expected Meta to spend around $51 billion on capex in 2025, the additional $14 billion caught some off guard. Yet, analysts see the move as bold but potentially brilliant, arguing it positions Meta to lead in AI innovation. Shares initially dipped but recovered, with the stock closing at an all-time high of $647.49 on Friday.

**The Bigger Picture**  
  
Zuckerberg isn’t shy about the risks. He’s acknowledged the possibility of overbuilding but believes missing out on AI would be a bigger blunder. ""The downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for the next 10–15 years,"" he said. With a track record of making high-stakes bets that pay off (hello, Instagram acquisition), the gamble could redefine how Meta operates—and how we interact with technology.

**What’s Next?** As Meta gears up for its Q4 earnings on Jan. 29, investors will be looking for more details on these grandiose AI plans. If Zuckerberg’s bets pay off, Meta might not just own the metaverse—it could be the backbone of tomorrow’s AI-driven economy.

Today's dip aside I can sell my shares and still make a bit of profit off them.

My question is what are people's general thoughts/opinions on Tesla? 

No one can read the future I know, but do you think the price could keep rising and is worth holding or is it getting a bit too risky to hold with Elon getting more involved in politics and Trump pushing the oil motive. Elon dropping questionable salutes during his speeches probably doesn't help confidence levels either 😅 ",2025-01-21,136,463
1i4e0ep_TSLA,TSLA,Is Tesla overvalued? The numbers don't lie,"I've taken a close look at Tesla's valuation, and honestly, I'm surprised by how much higher the price is than what several different valuation methods suggest. Take an average DCF analysis, for example - it came out to just $48.8 per share, which is miles below where Tesla is trading right now.

**The Price Seems Off:** Using a variety of approaches—including DCF analysis, Peter Lynch's method, and Ben Graham's method—I consistently find a huge gap between the current market price and what Tesla's actually worth. Some methods even suggest a negative value, indicating significant overvaluation. One more conservative calculation gave me an intrinsic value of $371 per share, which still indicates Tesla is way overvalued at current levels.

**Those Crazy Ratios:** Key ratios like the P/E (103.8x) and P/FCF (365.4x) are incredibly high, showing investors are paying a huge premium for Tesla's earnings and free cash flow. The incredibly low free cash flow yield (0.3%) further highlights this overvaluation. And a negative PEG ratio (-2.1x)? That's a serious warning sign. Even the EV/EBIT ratio of 171.8x is exceptionally high.

**Tesla's Strengths and Weaknesses:** To be fair, Tesla does have its strengths: strong growth, solid profitability, and financial health. But its capital allocation strategy could be better, and yeah it’s a great company, but its current valuation just doesn’t seem to match the reality of its fundamentals.

**Compared to the Competition:** Here’s another red flag: Tesla’s P/E ratio is 103.8x, the median is just 6.0x. Yes, Tesla’s revenue growth (18.8%), EPS growth (17.7%), and net income margin (15.5%) are impressive, but do those numbers justify such a massive valuation premium over its peers? I don’t think so.

**The Big Picture: High Stakes on Future Growth:** A significant portion of Tesla's current market cap is based on expectations of future growth. That's a big bet, and it makes me wonder if the market's expectations might be overly optimistic. The massive difference between its Enterprise Value ($814.7B) and Earnings Power Value ($109.2B) underscores this reliance on future growth.

Someone posted making money selling 7 day verticals on TSLA with delta .35 and 0.05. It looked like that had a $4,500 potential risk to make 800 and if TSLA pulled back it would be very painful.  
Here is a better way with much less risk but still fairly good profit and it is a credit to your account. If TSLA does pull back it works in your favor. As long as TSLA stays in the blue area you make money. The little Tan mark is TSLA current price when you buy it. It gives TSLA room to move down but keep u profitable.

To create it just duplicate / count down from current price as you see in the image and Buy 1 Sell 2 and Buy 1 Puts for price going up or call side for price going down.

This is a 1 week play.  
This has a profit of 215 in the flat blue area and profit of 450 if TSLA pulls back to peak area.  
The credit is 215 and the risk is 285 if TSLA Pulls way back out of the blue area. If TSLA pulls back to red line then loss is 80.00 and you can just get out if tanking. Ideally TSLA goes up or just stays where it is and then you good.

  
As each day passes and you get closer to DTE you lose less on any pullback.

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

But, I think there's actually a lot of hidden value in TSLA if someone could figure out how to quantify it that'd be good too, but here is - *The Simple Case for TSLA*.

TSLA can:  
Sell people cars that can link to their social media or favorite podcast on X-twitter through Starlink launched into orbit by SpaceX while the car drives itself because of proprietary Ai driven by one of the largest Ai-accelerated data centers on the planet owned by ... Tesla.

TSLA is the centerpiece to all of this. It's the ""store"" that sells everything else. And that's what Elon Musk has been building toward.

In other words, it's the Microsoft Windows of the PC. It's the Apple computer or iPhone. It's the center-of-gravity for all the technology that Musk is assembling. That is the simple case that NO one looks at.

Good luck getting ALL that ""smart tech"" integrated into your Ford, or your GM/Dodge/Toyota/whatever.

Musk owns it all, controls it all, and is integrating it all. And that has an extreme amount of value to it with an extremely wide moat. No one else can launch their own satellite-internet-network that can reach anywhere in the world piping the latest news from their own media platform into the one place people spend more time than work and their own beds...into their cars...while simultaneously harvesting data 24/7 to resell as a big-data tech company.

It's Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, all stuffed into a tiny box that you're presumably forced to spend half your life in while you drive to pick up your kids, take your dog to the park, get groceries, go to the bar, drive to work.

And you people sit here and think it's ""overvalued"".

I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

1galrgu_TSLA,TSLA,Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental credits,"Tesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla’s growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla’s bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

1gad8um_TSLA,TSLA,TSLA Earnings After Hours: Exploring Butterfly Spreads with a 500% R/R Setup,"
As we approach TSLA's earnings report after today's market close, the options market is pricing in a +/- 16-point move based on implied volatility. While calendar spreads typically offer an opportunity to exploit volatility discrepancies, I've found the current setups less attractive due to suboptimal reward-to-risk (R/R) ratios, despite the 30-40 point IV skew.

Instead, I've turned my focus to butterfly spreads, which seem to present better opportunities in this high-volatility environment. Here's what I’ve been screening for:

Expiration: This Friday's options
Breakeven Range: Minimum 10% between the breakeven points
Reward-to-Risk Ratio: At least 500% (5:1)
Front Leg Delta: 20-50 delta
Structure: 1/-2/1 butterfly (though variations like 1/-3/2 or Broken Wing Butterflies (BWB) could be explored, but that’s beyond the scope of this post)
Given TSLA's expected post-earnings movement, these butterfly setups can capture significant gains if the stock moves within the anticipated range. This strategy allows for tight risk control, and the favorable R/R ratio provides an interesting opportunity compared to other approaches like calendars, which, despite the IV skew, just don’t measure up this time around.

1gak7c4_TSLA,TSLA,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",2024-10-23,338,474

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",2024-10-11,1702,563

Tesla’s stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla’s growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.

In the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla’s lead remains substantial.

Tesla’s 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company’s upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.

1fuftc7_TSLA,TSLA,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

1fqk8k6_AMZN,AMZN,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

1fnzywr_TSLA,TSLA,Who thinks TSLA is going to miss earnings because cars are stored everywhere. ,"TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. 

The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. 

I think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the “AI” hype. 

Power-walls don’t sell, Solar does not pencil out, and they are not building a robot anytime soon.

But they still can’t make my dam Roadster, been on order for 4 years plus. 

Me thinking of taking out a nice Put position for the 16th. Short term Puts will be cheap and stock has rallied back over $250. Perfect timing to knock $50 bucks off the stock. 

That’s what happened last time.

* Wall Street played a game of tug-of-war on Monday, as stocks wavered but managed to cling to the momentum from last week’s rally. The S&P 500 ended the day virtually unchanged, inching up just 0.23 points, while the Nasdaq eked out a 0.21% gain, thanks in part to Nvidia’s 4% surge. Meanwhile, the Dow dropped 140 points, or 0.36%, as investors grew jittery ahead of crucial inflation data set to drop this week.
* With the Consumer Price Index report on Wednesday and retail sales data following on Thursday, all eyes are on the economic gauges that could either steady or spook the markets. After a week of whiplash, traders are hoping for clarity, but the volatility might not be over just yet.

# Tesla Cybertruck Now Starts at $100K After Dropping Cheapest Model

Tesla ($TSLA) just gave the Cybertruck's price tag a serious jolt—if you were holding out for the ""affordable"" $60,990 model, you're out of luck. Tesla quietly pulled that version from its lineup, leaving the cheapest Cybertruck at a jaw-dropping $99,990. That’s a $39,000 leap from where the price floor used to be.

# The Price of Progress?

But wait, there’s more. The tri-motor Cyberbeast, the souped-up version that puts your foot to the floor with more torque and speed, now costs $119,990. That’s a $20K hike from just a week ago. Remember when Elon Musk promised a $39,990 Cybertruck back in 2019? Ah, simpler times. With the base model gone, it looks like Tesla is banking on buyers with deeper pockets and a taste for luxury—because clearly, the entry-level market isn’t a priority anymore.

# Fast Deliveries or Slowing Demand?

Tesla claims it’s speeding up delivery times, with AWD models potentially arriving as early as this month. But don’t let the expedited shipping fool you—these price hikes might just be a sign that demand is cooling off faster than Musk anticipated. After all, how many folks are really ready to shell out six figures for a truck that looks like it drove straight out of a sci-fi flick?

Meanwhile, Cybertruck's bumpy road continues with recalls, sinking profits in Tesla's latest quarter, and a flurry of federal investigations. The dream of an affordable, mass-market EV truck seems further away than ever. Plus, faster deliveries could signal that Tesla's inventory is growing—a red flag that maybe, just maybe, those million pre-orders aren’t translating into actual sales. So, while Tesla might be speeding up production, it could also be facing the reality that a $100K truck isn’t exactly a hot commodity. But hey, if you’ve got $100K burning a hole in your pocket, Tesla’s got just the truck for you.

Trump’s return to X is a big deal—after all, this is the platform that played a huge role in his political rise. But there’s a twist. Trump previously vowed to stick to his own platform, Truth Social, after being banned from major social media sites. His comeback to X might signal a shift in strategy, especially with the 2024 election looming. And let’s not forget, this move comes after Musk’s recent endorsement of Trump, despite their very public beef just a couple of years ago.

# Stocks Stumble as the Spotlight Shifts

Trump’s return to X isn’t just about tweets—it’s affecting his wallet, too. Shares of Trump Media took a hit, dropping 5% on Monday. Investors seem to be questioning whether Trump’s renewed presence on X could spell trouble for Truth Social. After all, why would Trump’s followers stick around on his platform if he’s back to tweeting up a storm on X?

The timing couldn’t be more critical. Trump Media has been struggling financially, reporting a net loss of $16.4 million in the second quarter. With stocks already down nearly 50% since its public debut, the pressure is on. 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Investors are bracing for a pivotal week of inflation data, with the Producer Price Index (PPI) report dropping on Tuesday, followed by the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday. Economists are forecasting a slight slowdown in July’s PPI, expecting a 0.1% monthly increase compared to June’s 0.2%. This could be an early indicator that inflation pressures on producers are easing, which might bring some optimism to the markets ahead of the CPI release.

As it stands, there’s a nearly even split among investors on whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with current odds at 48%, down from 52% just a short time ago. All eyes are on these reports as they could heavily influence the Fed's next steps and the market's direction.

# Before Market Open:

* **Home Depot** ($HD) is one to watch as it gears up to report earnings. The home improvement giant saw a major boost during the pandemic, with folks stuck at home taking on DIY projects. But with the stock flatlining this year, investors are nervous that the renovation boom may be fading. This earnings report could set the tone for Home Depot’s performance for the rest of 2024. Analysts are expecting $4.50 earnings per share (EPS) on $43.38 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile, **Tencent Music Entertainment** ($TME), a subsidiary of Chinese tech titan Tencent Holdings, is also in the spotlight. As a powerhouse in China’s music industry, TME has been eyeing global expansion, bolstered by its 8.6% stake in Spotify and a recent partnership with Universal Music Group. Investors will be eager to hear more about the company’s growth strategy. The consensus forecast is $0.16 EPS on $996.68 million in revenue.",2024-08-12,1,0

1dtlvh3_META,META,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”

what does this measure?

this report looks at the initial balance (IB), which is the high and low formed during the first hour of trading. it checks the order in which the IB is formed and tracks which side breaks first: the high or the low. this helps identify the direction of the initial breakout after the IB is established.

**example** if the IB high is formed first, then the low forms, and it's more likely for the low to break after the IB is formed, then you can take positions targeting a break of the IB low.

how can I use this?

understanding the initial balance rejection can help you anticipate market direction after the first hour of trading. if the low is made first and the high breaks out more often, you can plan for a bullish move. conversely, if the high is made first and the low breaks out more often, you can prepare for a bearish move.

based on which side of the IB forms first, you want to target the side of the IB that breaks most often.

how can I use this?

you can use this report to set their trading strategies based on the initial balance rejection patterns. by knowing the likelihood of the initial breakout direction, you can better position your trades, set stop losses, and take profits effectively.",2024-06-28,1,0

1dkhutc_TSLA,TSLA,Elon's plan to get Tesla to $30T,"At the 2024 Tesla Shareholder meeting, Elon covered TSLA's growth strategy pretty extensively. He called it not a new chapter, but a ""new book"".

The growth strategy revolves around two key facets:

* Robotaxis, which he believes could be worth $5T
* Optimus, which he believes could be worth $25T.
   * He gives the math during his talk too, basically saying that the world could sell a billion of these a year (!), at 10% TSLA market capture, with $10K in profit per unit, TSLA would yield $1T in profit per year. With a 25x p/e, he believes this could get them to $25T. 
   * The 1B units/yr seems wildly insane to me, but he does make the point that the car industry manufactures 100M cars/yr, and we would need more of these things than cars.
      * Yes, I am a value investor lol (I actually think Buffett-style is a better fit, because we're not doing Graham cigar butts), and I realize how insane this claim is. 

  
Things hurting the growth in my opinion:

* Elon's pay package is 10% of the current mkt cap. While I believe it was the right thing to do, I think him threatening to flip the board if he didn't get it was immature and untoward. Makes me question that we have an ""honest and skillful"" CEO at the helm, which is a key component to Buffett-style investing.
* The current revenue breakdown TSLA is almost entirely EV manufacturing, despite their attempts to push into other verticals (solar, insurance, charging network, etc). In ARKK's analysis, they believe 90% of the value of Tesla by 2029 will be entirely due to robotaxis

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

1dcxlru_TSLA,TSLA,$TSLA Trade Plan,"TSLA has consistently respected the 172 level over the past several days, and finally we may be at a breaking point heading into tomorrow. Today confirmed the bears were in control (at least for now) with many failed push attempts. The most notable failed push was the 179.5 this morning. 179.5 was (and still is) the inflection line. A large reject of this level = bears in control; TSLA's behavior after this confirmed the bears were in control with its inability to maintain strength today.

Additionally, SPY flows did not heavily affect TSLA today. This has been par for the course except for the end of last week. There is a chance TSLA gaps down past 172 tomorrow morning, so if this is the case, I will modify my trade plan on a confirmed reject of 172.

TSLA has (and always) likes to play the trapping game, so I will only be trading this on confirmation rather than anticipation.

**Trade Plan:**

* Long a 162.5 Put on a confirmed Breakdown with my Risk as a reclaim of 172.

**Profit Target:**

* 160 OR valid intraday exit signal (i.e., buying flows on the tape)

**Risks:**

* As mentioned above and before, TSLA does not usually feed off of SPY flows, but if the market remains strong, this does not mean the strong flows will 100% not affect TSLA's behavior. We are in a strong market cycle and we cannot discount that
* Bulls regain control; In other words, if the failed pushes begin reclaiming on volume, that would be one sign of a shift of control

1d7wmef_META,META,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.

The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.

X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.

Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services.

While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla’s stock price is down 29% this year.

Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.

“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.”

To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.

‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’

Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.

Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?”

In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.

Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.

At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million “Dojo” supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.

At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.

The memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.

The Information previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions.

On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.

Conflicts of interest

While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.

“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post.

Tesla’s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.

If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI.

Musk’s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.”

Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.

“When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.”

Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.

“That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said.

Musk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.

For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.

At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.

A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.

However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia’s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.

I’m kind of stuck in a dilemma of whether I should hold Tesla stock and hope that it will return to my purchase price, or sell all and reinvest into ETFs. I don’t really have any goals in the long term or short term so I don’t really mind individual stocks or ETFs. I just hate seeing a downward trend for the past year and not sure if my money would be better in the SP500. I also don’t want to preemptively sell and have it skyrocket past my purchase price. All opinions would be appreciated!

For context:

Shares: 53
Initial purchase price: $279.41
Current price: $177.50

Would probably invest into VOO, VTI, VXUS if I were to reinvest into ETFs.

1d4w5ni_TSLA,TSLA,Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package ,"Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker’s board.

Tesla’s shareholder meeting is on June 13.

The report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk’s pay package. Tesla’s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk’s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.

ISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.

The proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla’s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.

“At a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,” ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.

Pay package push

Tesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla’s Gigafactory facility in Austin.

Tesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk’s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk’s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.

“Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,” Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.

Tesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon’s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.

Proxy advisor pull

ISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.

They’ve also been the direct target of Musk’s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they “effectively control the stock market” on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called “passive” or institutional shareholders.

Institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.

ISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it “remains excessive,” noting that “the board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‘all or nothing’ option in this vote.”

The proxy advisor alluded to Musk’s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.

“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS said.

1cxyk9t_TSLA,TSLA,"I'm a full time trader and this is my total pre market cheat sheet, including positioning analysis on US markets, NVDA, TSLA and FX. ","ANALYSIS:

Overall US Market:

* SPX Skew is elevated, traders remain bullish. Skew points slightly down, but this is hedging ahead of FOMC. Traders selling some calls but its v low volume. 
* Note: positioning and trader sentiment around NVDA remains bullish. 
* Because of this positive expectation around NVDA, traders are buying calls on QQQ. Traders expect Nasdaq rot continue to go higher. 
* So we do see some disparity there in what traders are doing. They are more bullish on tech right now ahead of NVDA. 
* Momentum continues to show stronger buyers, we are at ATH on both QQQ and SPX. 
* MSFT and NFLX both hit new highs yesterday. 
* VIX liquidity continues to be very low, whilst liquidity in equities is increasing. The fact that VIX liquidity is very low is a sign that traders have no real fear in the market. Bulls v comfortable right now.

On FX & metals:

* As mentioned in other post, GBPUSD positioning bullish, particularly after CPI came hotter than expected. Short term and long term we see skew point up. 1.28 target. on EURUSD, skew points higher but price is stuck below 1.085 for now. 1.08 is clear support, traders target 1.09, even calls on 1.10.
* On Gold and Silver, we can see a slight pullback or flattening whilst traders wait to see more volume. V low volume but mostly traders selling their calls now and buying puts. Still low volumes though so not expecting big moves. But also not seeing big move higher yet.

Key stocks for focus:

* **NVDA: skew is flattish this week but pointing higher. Traders will be looking for 1000 if earnings come in in line. More if stock split. A lot of calls around there. As a result of NVDA earnings looking higher, SMCI higher too. Other semis in general quite bullish on hopeful expectations for NVDA.**
* **TSLA: Got bit of a jump yday as skew pointed higher and we got good news to support. Gamma is mostly between 180-190. Can see move to 190 if NVDA supports, but beyond that not much OTM call gamma. Positioning iTM is strong but not seeing move higher. More likely possible rejection from 100D MA.**



DATA LEDE:

* UK CPI: Headline came out 2.3% vs 2.1% expected. Still down a lot on the 3.2% last month. Hot, but not that bad. 
* But if we look under the hood, we see that there are areas of the UK inflation that are heating up. 
* Core CPI came 3.9% vs 3.6% expected. Only down slightly from 4.2%
* And if we look at Services in particular, we see Services inflation at 5.9%, much hotter than the 5.4% expected and more or less sticky to last month.
* BOE have been more dovish/neutral recently
* This increases risk of moving more hawkish again. 
* Now traders see just 38bps of rate cuts in 2024 after the data, much less than before. 
* RBNZ hawkish pause. 
* FOMC minutes later. 



MARKETS:

* SPX: Flat at 5317. Bounced off high of 5325 again, same as last couple of days.  Market will likely remain flat ahead of NVDA earnings and FOMC. WAS A RECORD CLOSE YDAY
* NDX: At record highs. 18,730. 1.5% away from 19k, so can be in view if nVDA earnings come good
* Dow: Flat just under 40k
* GER40: Slightly lower this morning, all just normal profit taking and hedging at these highs, positioning remains bullish. 
* HKG50: Flat at 19,202 today, absolutely flat
* OIL: slightly lwoer again. Mostly flat around 78. Was rejected at 80 WTI
* Gold slightly lower today, at 2413. Support still 2400. 



FX:

* USD moving slightly higher again, paring some of the post CPI losses.  With this, USDJPY continues higher, as yen remains weak after failed intervention. Failed to break 152, hence moving higher. 
* EURUSD stuck just under 1.285, bullish positioning.  
* GBPUSD at 1.272. Target looks like 1.28 especially given CPI hot.

* If it happens, par for the course
* More importantly, I don't stare at the stock all night/morning and can save my emotional capacity for outside of trading. 

$TSLA opened with a large gap down a little past my 172 target, and I exited with an average price of about $2.45 for about a $4,000 gain.

1cfxfu0_TSLA,TSLA,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket including analysis of USDJPY after intervention and TSLA positioning,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Let’s look at and analyse the main things happening in premarket first of all. 
* Firstly, the Yen intervention, which Japan’s Kanda hasn’t confirmed but reports are out from DJ that thats what happened this morning. 
* We saw yen weaken to 160 vs the USD. This was touted by JPM as the intervention point that BOJ were looking at, although their commentary last week was all very much vague. 
* When we saw 160 hit, we saw a big drop in USDJPY, as yen squeezed higher. 
* The price action was more extreme because Japan has a national holiday today, hence trading volumes were thin. 
* WE saw it drop from 160 to 154.5
* It found support from the technicals at the 20 day Moving average, as we see below:
* We saw recovery above the 155 level. 155 is one of the key gamma levels, where there is a lot of put support there. The bigger key gamma level, below this is 152. There is a hell of a lot of put support at 152. If the BOJ wants the yen to meaningfully improve vs the USD, it needs to get USDJPY below 152. Thats when we can go meaningfully lower. Above there, and we expect it to find support from these gamma levels and move higher, as we saw it do from 155. 
* Skew actually points higher in USDJPY now. This tells us that traders are not really expecting much more meaningful intervention right now. We can see USDJPY move higher again soon. Probably won’t be as effective as BOJ hoped. 
* Now the other key news from premarket, is TESLA, who have now received the regulatory approval for FULL self driving in China, rather than the limited product they had on offer already. 
* Tesla is pumping in premarket. 
* If we look at the gamma levels, we see 200 as having a lot of open interest. As such, we can see it as a magnet for price action moving forward. 
* FTSE pushed higher to 8200, but we see skew lowering. This tells us traders are hedging for price action to mveo lower now. The move is likely close to done for now, except if the Fed support move higher. We expect that because OTM delta isnt really showing much call delta so traders aren’t betting FTSE goes much higher. 
* HKG50 breakout from downtrend since 2023 continues, hitting 18k level today. 18k is v big gamma level, hence why we saw price action reverse from here. 
* In SPX, we see traders unwind some of their hedges as they bet that geopolitical pressures are mostly behind us. We see that too, as oil skew points lower which suggests traders expect oil to move down soon. 
* Finally, busy week ahead. 
* This week ahead, we have FOMC decision on Wednesday, as well as jobs numbers throughout the week, which will give us some insight into the labour market. 
* Put on top of that all the following earnings reports, and we are set for a volatile week of trading. 

DATA LEDE:

* Spain inflation rate:
* 3.3% YOY vs 3.4% expected, previous reading was 3.2%
* SO ticked up from last month, but not as much as expected. 
* GERMAN inflation rate:

MARKETS:

* SPX set to open above 5100 this morning, pulled up by Tesla and Aapl. Currently trading at 5112. This is just above the highs of Friday. 
* Nasdaq: up 0.3% in premarket, trading at 17,780. 17,850 is a resistance, then The next big resistance will be the 18k level. 
* Dow Jones: Flat in premarket, trading at 38,300. 
* HKG50 up 1% again in premarket. Now at 17,750. Touched 18k then came down from there. 18k is now the strong resistance. 
* UK100 higher to 8200, pared slightly to 8180. Still up 0.4% today. 
* GER40: flat around 18,140.
* Oil: Flat at 83.65. Maintaining the uptrend drawn since December 2023. 
* GOld: Flat above 2300. 
* VIX: Vix flat at 15.22. last week closed perfectly at the put support of 15. Was a big VIX crush last week. Opened today at 15.22. 

FX:

* USDJPY closed Friday at 158.3.
* In early Monday trading, it moved up to 160. This was a key level where traders were hedging for intervention.
* It seemed as though we did get that fX intervention hence the big decline.
* This decline was right down to 154.5
* This is where the 20 day Moving average was and so it found support there.
* Also a key gamma level at 155. 
* It moved below this level, before recovering above again. 
* Note: its a national holiday in Japan, hence why more exaggerated trading on thin volumes. 
* Despite this no official comment from BOJ that they have intervened, although that is the clear assumption. 
* So Yen squeezed higher after hitting 160 vs USD
* All other currencies quite flat compared.
* GBPUSD up 0.3% to 1.253EURUSD same trend, up 0.2% after selling off on Friday. Now at 1.071. On Friday, it retested 1.07 before pushing higher.

1cc3dtf_TSLA,TSLA,INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.,"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  
  
INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",2024-04-24,92,100

Tesla also urged its investors to approve moving the company's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas in a regulatory filing.

1bvc05n_TSLA,TSLA,"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'","
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

1bpy94c_AMZN,AMZN,Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr’s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Accessories

The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.

Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.

The SU7 supports Apple’s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.

Tesla’s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company’s “Full Self Driving” for city streets has yet to be released in the country.

Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the “Max” version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche’s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.

Ecosystem of devices

The SU7 is part of Xiaomi’s recently launched “Human x Car x Home” strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company’s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.

Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.

Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.

The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle’s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

Did i rush it and bought too soon? Or was the biggest mistake not listening to myself when i saw a down trend and buying anyways? Because even if i shorted when it broke downward i would have been stopped anyways right? Because the wick of the third candle when up quite a bit.

If i missed something that would have told me it was a bad idea to go with TSLA please tell me because i'm not sure if it's the strategy that failed or me (Guessing it was me).

17j4q1u_TSLA,TSLA,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"\*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*

Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen

Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.

Tesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla’s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla’s competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla’s competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla’s current offerings as well as Tesla’s future capabilities.

The Cybertruck further highlights Tesla’s habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla’s consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla’s Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.” EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck’s preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla’s Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that “We dug our own grave” when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.",2023-10-29,354,543

17bgo1o_TSLA,TSLA,These 3 EV start-ups that rode the Tesla wave are now penny stocks.,"**As investors sought the next Tesla (TSLA), a slew of EV stocks popped up at the start of this decade. Following exciting debuts, three electric vehicle start-ups are now trading as penny stocks.**

**1. Nikola ($NKLA),** In recent trading, the stock price of Nikola, an electric vehicle (EV) start-ups that was once promising, fell by more than 8% to $1.03. The company's stock price fell sharply by 33% in October, and it has already lost over half of its worth for the year. At first, Nikola was valued at more than $3 billion when it went public in June 2020 through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal, with great expectations to become the ""Tesla of trucking."" But soon after making its debut, the stock peaked at more than $90 per share, and it has been steadily declining ever since. 

**2. Fisker ($FSR)**, an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, had its stock fall 3.5% to $5.92 in recent trading. Although it briefly traded below $5 per share over the summer, it has subsequently recovered some of its value. Fisker went public in October 2020 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction valued at $2.9 billion at the time. However, a few months later, its stock reached a peak of over $32 and has been steadily declining since then. The stock is down 8% this month and has lost roughly 20% of its value year to date, illustrating the company's struggles in a competitive EV market.

**3. Lucid ($LCID),** an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, had its stock fall by more than 9% to $4.53, setting a new 52-week low. The stock has dropped 18% this month and has lost one-third of its value year to date. Lucid went public in July 2021 via a large $24 billion SPAC offering, and its shares quickly rose beyond $64 per share. However, it has been steadily declining since then, with only sporadic short-term rises. Lucid's recent problems include a nearly 30% decline in EV manufacturing in the third quarter and dismal Q3 EV deliveries, despite efforts to attract buyers with discounts and lower-cost models.",2023-10-19,11,19

16mzk9f_TSLA,TSLA,What would need to happen for TSLA to *not* be overvalued today?,"Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.

It's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.

$880B \* 1.10\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share

So how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The ""for"" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:

$1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings

So how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the ""TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold"" in the comments

Tesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about

$57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually

Conclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&P. This isn't even including profits from the energy storage sector of the business, or the wildcards of robotaxis and bots.",2023-09-19,92,275

I'm currently in the journey to learn how to be a profitable scalper. After close to a year into my journey, I've decided to purely focus on a basketball of stocks (e.g., AAPL,TSLA, NVDA).  I've heard about traders being profitable by just trading one ticker and I'd like to find out if this is possible. 

As practice, I've been eyeballing them for everyday for awhile now and just getting used to how they move. 

I'd like to (if at all possible) focus on these stocks and be very familiar with their price action , idiosyncrasies and characteristics. My focus is to only focus on the first hour.

Problem is, I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for and it's probably too soon for me understand the nuances of each of these stocks.

Do these stocks react at certain levels? Do they act a certain way during a time of the day? Are they sensitive to movements of the SPY or QQQ?

  
Any pros out there care to provide some guidance on this? Or is this a futile endeavour?  


Cheers

12qiq5n_TSLA,TSLA,Time to buy Tesla ($TSLA) stock before Q1 earnings?," 

Tesla ($TSLA) will be a highlight of this week’s earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.

With shares of $TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.

Let’s see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.

**Q1 Preview**

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.

The dip in Tesla’s YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d91a2d5fcfc7ad728237fb839d2e98f65d8a143)

Image Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

While Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company’s earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla’s profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.

Tesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.

With that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share. 

**Deliveries & Demand**  

The ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla’s quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla’s willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022.  

This would still fall short of Wall Street’s estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla’s ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock. 

**Growth & Outlook**

Tesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla’s growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.

According to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter.  

On the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/wjxy3fvzdmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=af3049e7976c81d7b4fddd720f49b219f194bcd6)

**Performance & Valuation**

Tesla stock is up an impressive +52% year to date to largely outperform the S&P 500’s +8% and the Auto Manufacturers-Domestic Markets +22%. As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors’ +4% and Ford’s +9% YTD performance.

Even better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors’ +41%, Ford’s +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry’s +88%. 

Shares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.

**Bottom Line**

Going into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Tesla’s annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.

Although the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be  rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease. ",2023-04-18,76,112

10kh5rn_MSFT,MSFT,1-24-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis (and MSFT earnings),"Well we started the day off with a ton of NYSE stocks being halted… granted there were some memers halted… a lot of these stocks were boomer stocks which should not be limiting up or down like they did… Apparently it was a “technical” issue… the most interesting thing is some of these tapes will be revised which I am curious how that will effect the markets tomorrow and overnight. 

&#x200B;

MSFT as I suspected “beat” again for me a beat means stock goes green not necessarily all the details… I am now two for two with Netflix and MSFT correctly predicted… next is TSLA tomorrow night. I honestly feel TSLA will see a miss but perhaps give good guidance. 

&#x200B;

This was my thesis prior to earnings… and this also remains my thesis currently. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lho80ttq92ea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f51fdd95d0ea8908a337b27a59bb61af5a6b35c

I talked about it in premarket today that there was a very real scenario that we would see an inside day/ tight range day today as we were very over due for one of those. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cbooemgr92ea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b54f114c57376a68f02be1a09e80ae1a78275ce

Looking at the daily chart here that is exactly what we got today. Now most of the time an inside day is considered a continuation pattern therefore the pattern of bullish should continue. With the help of MSFT I do believe that we are finally going to start our push to 405.2. If bulls can conquer 405.2 we are well on our way to touch 410 before we get to FOMC next Wednesday. 

The bulls also back tested support at the daily 200ema today and managed to hold it closed back to back candles over the daily 200ema. The bulls really struggled to break through and hold over 400.6 today. That will be the biggest resistance to watch tomorrow, however, with this green after hours if that holds we could see a gap up over it and not have to worry about it. 

The last remaining bear market resistance line comes in at 402.4 tomorrow. 

SPY Key Support- 398.9 -> 396.7 -> 395.9 -> 393.6

SPY Key Resistance- 400.6 -> 401.6 -> 405.2

Taking a look at futures prior to the MSFT earnings release we were actually seeing a worrisome double top at 4035 for the bulls. However now that we have a nice push here we have broken that double top and presumably will see continuation tomorrow. Futures also closed a full candle over the daily 200ema for the first time since December 1st. 

One thing to keep in mind on SPY and Futures is that the daily 50ema is getting ready to crossover the 100ema for the first time since February. 

Futures Key Support- 4035 -> 4020 -> 4007 -> 3985

Futures Key Resistance- 4055 -> 4080 -> 4095

&#x200B;

Taking a look at Tesla here I was actually very tempted into a 30dte short position on TESLA. However, almost all of the previous earning days on tesla besides one were very flat. 

Tesla reports tomorrow after the bell and I do expected a miss on it. IF we get a rogue beat or amazing guidance we could end up seeing a very large green day on Thursday for tesla. 

We are looking at a possible evening star doji pattern forming here on Tesla with a double top rejection at 143.9. 

Still riding this blue bull channel here Tesla has officially crossed its 8ema over the 20ema. 

Tesla Key Support- 139.4 -> 136 -> 133.3

Tesla Key Resistance- 143.9 -> 146.2 -> 150 -> 154

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yoln4w1t92ea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=62c8153900434e55c3a357a7414789297724ab33

The VIX had a potential bull flag formed, however, with this rejection of the daily 8ema and closure back under 19.7 that is now negated and we should look for further downside which would align with the thought that SPY will continue its climb to 405 to 410.

Overall today was a really tough day to trade. Very low volume and very low ranges do not make for great trading. 

I was able to keep my streak of my first two plays of the day being green for the 6th day in a row now alive which is great! 

I did close my 14dte calls after hours on that huge spike. However, I am back in some 402C 14dte now with an expectation of a move to 405.2 

I still remain bullish until otherwise proven. It definitely seems I am one of the few bulls right now. I don’t think earnings season is going to bring the massive dump many are calling for. I also don’t know if FOMC gives the reaction many are hoping for… though I will be cash until after the FOMC meeting is done.",2023-01-24,12,5

zuaium_TSLA,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review 12/24/22","As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.

§ They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.

§ Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)

§ Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%

§ ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%

§ FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets

§ Low-Cost Provider:

· Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins.

· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.

§ Intangibles

· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.

· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.

· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.

· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.

· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.

§ It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.

§ When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Ha! Difficult, very difficult!

§ 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion

§ 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)

§ 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28)

§ Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449

§ Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0%

§ Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4%

§ Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.

§ This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.

§ Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.

§ To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25.

§ At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.

§ With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.

§ When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05

§ With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

zpuycg_TSLA,TSLA,"Elizabeth Warren has said: Elon Musk took over Twitter, but he's still the CEO of Tesla (TSLA). That raises legal concerns — is he creating conflicts of interest? Is he misappropriating company resources?","In a letter to Tesla’s board, the Democratic senator asks whether investors have been harmed by the billionaire tech mogul’s time running the social network.

Elon Musk’s chaotic tenure running Twitter has already drawn scrutiny from an array of international government officials, who have professed concern about his changes to content moderation, including the suspension of several journalists, and new restrictions on promoting rival social networks. (The Musk management style was again on display after his followers voted to give him the boot as the Twitter C.E.O. in a poll he ran overnight; more on the latest head-snapping developments later.)

Now, DealBook is first to report, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is taking aim at an issue with more serious potential legal consequences: whether Mr. Musk has created a series of conflicts of interest with and misappropriation of resources from Tesla, the electric carmaker he also runs.

*“As you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla’s board to ensure that its C.E.O. is meeting all his legal responsibilities and serving as an effective leader,” Ms. Warren wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chairwoman, on Sunday night. (Ms. Denholm did not respond to a request for comment.) While the chaos at Twitter isn’t Tesla’s concern, Ms. Warren raised the possibility that many of Mr. Musk’s actions may be shortchanging Tesla.*

Ms. Warren asked whether Mr. Musk’s diverting of resources from Tesla — including software engineers and senior executives — is harming the carmaker. In her letter, the senator also questioned whether Mr. Musk’s assertion that their being seconded to Twitter was purely voluntary, citing an anonymous employee who told CNBC, “most would also feel it was impossible to turn down a direct request from Mr. Musk without later facing poor performance reviews or other consequences.”

Ms. Warren also suggested the possibility of Mr. Musk **intentionally shortchanging either Twitter or Tesla to benefit the other**, including Twitter potentially overcharging Tesla for ads or tweaking the social network’s algorithms to benefit the carmaker. She also asked the board whether content appearing on Twitter under Mr. Musk’s new content moderation, including a rise in misinformation and what the senator said was hate speech, could end up hurting Tesla’s reputation.

How much further do you think BTC will fall due to this sell-off?,"Early last year, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin, banking on what the electric car maker called the digital currency’s “long-term potential.” The company has already sold three-quarters of its holdings.

“As of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency,” Tesla said in its second-quarter earnings statement on Wednesday. The company said those sales added $936 million in cash to its balance sheet.

It’s a rapid retreat for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, who was a heavy crypto booster during last year’s runup, frequently tweeting about various digital currencies. The price of bitcoin has lost half its value in the past four months during what’s been dubbed a “crypto winter.”

The Long Play

\- We break out and hold the prior resistance we created on Friday (384.85), and sell into the 388.42 level/gap.  At the end of Friday we tried for the break but the market closed, closing us over the resistance. Which is why I wont be surprised if we see a gap up on Monday as well.

The Short Play

\- We fail the breakout and break through support (383.35) with room to tank till 378.36, which is also a gap close to the downside.

vxi1zm_TSLA,TSLA,Was the TWTR bid by Elon just a way to hide a massive sale of TSLA Stock?,"Everywhere is reporting that Musk now has a ""massive windfall that dwarfs any bitcoin losses"" due to the sale of the TSLA stock to fund the TWTR deal, and as that deal is no longer going ahead, he's pockets the cash.

I'm then reminded that some shrewd analysts suggested that the divorces of Bezos and Gates to their wives were actually cover to sell massive amounts of stocks without causing a run on their companies (Founders selling huge chunks of stock usually causes investors to shit it but can be explained away for personal reasons).

I'm starting to think that Elon knows he's got a tough road ahead, the golden days of Tesla stock price are behind him and he's just liquidated massive amounts of stock at what will seem like a really high price in 10 years from now as all the big car manufacturers finally catch up and dilute Tesla's only real advantage (being first).

I have only focused on investing with size into TSLA and then some passive index investing with Vanguard.

Note: In the past, I avoided dividend investing because I'm in a high tax bracket and didn't want to pay extra taxes on dividends while I was still working (I figured I would focus on investing in a growth stock company I spent a lot of time studying where I knew that I wouldn't have to think about dividend income anytime soon).

&#x200B;

**Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)**

&#x200B;

Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:

&#x200B;

* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)

&#x200B;

* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?

&#x200B;

* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).

&#x200B;

* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)

&#x200B;

* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.

&#x200B;

Let's start with an automotive sales part:

&#x200B;

* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9)

&#x200B;

* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.

&#x200B;

* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**.

&#x200B;

* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)?

&#x200B;

* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\^9 = **1.4T\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?

&#x200B;

* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.

&#x200B;

But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 2. Automotive market.**

&#x200B;

Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). 

&#x200B;

No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:

&#x200B;

* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)). Citation: ""... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ..."". From this we can assume **EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.**

&#x200B;

* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called ""New Energy vehicles"" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)). So **EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.**

&#x200B;

* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)), i.e. **50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030**

&#x200B;

* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles)). Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn't locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of **20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.**

&#x200B;

2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e)): China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = **0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.**

&#x200B;

The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005505/en/Global-Automotive-Market-COVID-19-Growth-Forecast-2020-2030---ResearchAndMarkets.com)) global automotive sales should reach **122.8M units by 2030.** Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain **62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030.** It is important to understand that this is a **bullish estimate rather than the base.** First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)).

&#x200B;

**Chapter 3. Tesla's market share.**

&#x200B;

From [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com), we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph:

* 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%**
* 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%**
* 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%**
* 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**

&#x200B;

Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.

&#x200B;

For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.

&#x200B;

Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y's original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).

&#x200B;

We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.

&#x200B;

So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.

&#x200B;

Despite all that, let's consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain **8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030.** This is whopping **56.5% lower** than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a **TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030.** An **annual return of 2.5% (below inflation)** if you invest at current prices.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 4. ASP**

&#x200B;

Perhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.

&#x200B;

8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)). It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).

&#x200B;

According to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf) (Q1-Q3 combined) **ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD**, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it's a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, **Tesla's 2030 ASP is $49.5K** (38K x 1.03\^9) or **25% lower** than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.

&#x200B;

Deducting these extra 25% results in **TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B**, or **-0.7%** **annual return if you invest today**. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.

&#x200B;

**Margins.**

&#x200B;

One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter polls**

&#x200B;

When we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/shares-outstanding)), and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).

&#x200B;

Due to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.

&#x200B;

A good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding)). Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings **total share dilution to 10.3%** (1.011\^9).

&#x200B;

On top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn't play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).

&#x200B;

**The results:**

&#x200B;

If I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:

* our estimated target for market cap of **840B USD**, 
* and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, 

Tesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\^9 / (1.103) **= 323B USD today**

&#x200B;

Or with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = **287 USD per share today**

&#x200B;

For Tesla bulls: before you say it's outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, **expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn't even account for.**

&#x200B;

**Chapter other product lines of Tesla:**

&#x200B;

As for the other product lines, it's difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/05/03/tesla-energy-storage-deployments-way-up-solar-slows-further/)). Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.

&#x200B;

How a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.

&#x200B;

The TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla's valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.

&#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving**

&#x200B;

This one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*

&#x200B;

Since Tesla doesn't share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.

&#x200B;

After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon's statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa's challenges and even before.

&#x200B;

But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). For the sake of the argument, let's say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\*\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.

&#x200B;

If Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That's where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that's where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.

&#x200B;

Fast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it's one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.

&#x200B;

And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.

&#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: To be continued...**

&#x200B;

I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla's ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.

&#x200B;

**Chapter History.**

&#x200B;

A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was **the** ***stonk*** **in 2000**. Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars.

&#x200B;

And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?

&#x200B;

By looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.

&#x200B;

It doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

&#x200B;

My conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.

&#x200B;

P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz ""announced"" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....

Your error bars are too large to create a valid result.

You also have to hope that the expected competition coming to the company's current sectors won't cause existing growth to slow. And that's not going to happen. Every car maker on Earth is coming for the EV market, because manufacturing most kinds of ICE cars is going to be banned in the future, and they want to remain in business, and will not find it hard to do so.

Bottom line: if Tesla doesn't start to access new business lines (robotics is a good example) it will start to get its ass kicked in EV, and it will collapse and be remembered as a fad.

That's all the certainty there is. It may go up, but it will certainly go down if it doesn't start reinventing. Getting any number of significant digits on its future value is magical thinking.",2022-01-28,377,663

I plan to cash out after a -30% drop, maybe ill aim for a 50% drop which means Tesla would be either at $949.44 for a -30%. Or, $677.45 for the -50%. This leaves Tesla with room to run from its current position of $1,100 a 23% gain to the final breakeven point or, 54% to the final optional step.   


**Worst Case:**   
Tesla runs up from my even price of $1,354.91 to $2,100 a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap. I'll take a half a million dollar loss which I can afford all day, any day. Won't kill me. (-50%).  


✍️**Note:**  
If Tesla doubles from its current price, it will be worth more than Apple and Microsoft by $1 Trillion Dollars.  I strongly believe the ROI for new buyers is dramatically decreasing. In other words, the Greater Fool is running low/near the end. There is too much risk, too many emotions, and greed flowing around. Be fearful when others are greedy. In this case, ill profit from their beyond delusional greed. Or, Tesla is currently at peak levels and I don't even get to the next steps. Still a win.

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

>Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

>Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more

>However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

>""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

>Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

>Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

>""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.

>Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.

>Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.

>The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.

>""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.

>""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

>Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

>Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

>With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

>Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.

>Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

What's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I’m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I’m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I’m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we’ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don’t over leverage yourself, and don’t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we’re not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you’d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I’m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there’s some nuances to trading oil that I’m not aware of.  I’m sure there’s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don’t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I’d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone’s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend.

Is this the new inflationary hedge option?","# Small-Cap Crypto Execs Talk Bitcoin On Corporate Balance Sheets: 'It Makes A Lot Of Sense' 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/r7jits995wz61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca2d6276045d85d6c4f0062eb352ae91dd861f6)

At the Benzinga Global Small Cap  Conference Friday,  Benzinga cryptocurrency editor Catherine Ross hosted  a panel discussion  on how digital currencies are disrupting finance  and providing  opportunities for innovation in payments, privacy and  efficiency.

The panel discussion included Geoff Morphy, president of **Bitfarms Ltd** (OTC:BFARF), Charles Allen, CEO of **BTCS Inc** (OTCQB:[BTCS](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BTCS#OTCQB)), Richard Byworth, CEO of **Diginex Ltd** (NASDAQ:EQOS) and Sheldon Bennett, CEO of **Dmg Blockchain Solutions Inc** (OTCQB:DMGGF).

**Adding Crypto To The Balance Sheet:** Allen said more companies are beginning to add cryptocurrencies to the balance sheet, including high-profile names like **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA), **Square Inc** (NYSE:SQ) and **MicroStrategy Incorporated** (NASDAQ:MSTR).

“It  makes a lot of sense for larger companies to start putting crypto  on  their balance sheets. It’s a nice inflationary hedge,” Allen said.

Accepting crypto as a payment method is more difficult for companies to do, he said. 

Byworth said Diginex helps a lot of international companies add **Bitcoin** (CRYPTO: BTC) to their balance sheets. 

“From  the perspective of 'does it make sense?' yeah, we are big  believers of  the inflationary hedge with the very disproportionate  reaction we’ve  seen to the pandemic by central banks, which was in  fairness pretty  much their only option given all the printing that  they’ve done since  2008,” Byworth said.

Up until  2021, Morphy said Bitfarms was in a position in which it had  to sell  almost every Bitcoin it mined just to pay the bills and invest  in  growth.

“In January of this year,  we actually started a Bitcoin retention  program, and we have well over  500 Bitcoin on the balance sheet now,” he  said.

“We’re  big bulls, and when you can mine a Bitcoin for under $10,000  and it’s  currently in the market at between $50,000 and $60,000, what we  enjoy  doing is putting it on the balance sheet and then because that’s   effectively our adjusted EBITDA, we get the compounding feature of not   just having the Bitcoin on our balance sheet from a low cost, but we   basically embed our profit in there as well to compound it.”

**Responding To Elon Musk:** Cryptocurrencies have come under fire this week after **Tesla, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will no longer be accepting  Bitcoin as payment due to its negative impact on the environment.

Bennett said DMG Blockchain uses the cheapest energy available for its mining, which is often renewable.

“Solar  is the cheapest energy, wind is the cheapest energy,  geothermal is the  cheapest. Iceland is a great example of that,” Bennett  said.

“All Bitcoin mining companies are looking for the lowest-cost energy. Any company is.”

When  asked about which cryptos their companies hold and which they  hold in  their personal accounts, the consensus among the executives is  that  they are bullish on Bitcoin and **Ethereum** (CRYPTO: ETH).

None of the panel members said their companies hold shares of **Dogecoin** (CRYPTO: DOGE) or other meme-inspired cryptos.

The TA Gods have spoken to me in sleep, and after that I handcrafted this masterpiece TA: applying the anatomy of two most famous historical squeezy examples VW and TSLA to current GME","&#x200B;

[The GME thesis, which I aim to explain via the comparison with VW and TSLA \(daily chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/e96lpakez1z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=862612bd4206afdb06123d26047d374f8a07e176)

&#x200B;

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

mqgj77_TSLA,TSLA,TSLA 04/16 700 Puts. Destroyed.,"Greetings everyone,

Can’t sleep even after a couple of sleeping pills. Today I got caught up in TSLA action and averaged my position until there were no more money left for me to do so. 

I made a decision to hold this position overnight. Although, I doubt there is any chance for me to get out of this without being wounded. 

Am completely devastated by the price action and by being such a fool. My life savings are being destroyed right in front of my eyes in a matter of hours.

Please be very cautious and don’t break your own rules. You don’t want to experience such unnecessary soul crushing event irl.

Edit:
Guys, I can't express how heart-warming it is to read all those uplifting comments from you. I'm beyond grateful for this. You really put a seed of hope in my soul that I can and will recover from this and it might not take as many years as I fear.

Update:
As of now I'm going to hold my position till lunch time and see how everything goes, because my puts already almost worthless and I don't care that much about leftovers... At least I can hold it till the end of the day.
If there is any solution you would like to give it would be much appreciated. I could buy long-term calls for example with leftovers or do something else. Please feel free to brainstorm and share your ideas.

For those of you who cares for the images... I can share my loss after my position is closed.

P.S.
My broker (IB) triggered PDT rule. If I'm not mistaken the only action I can take right now is to close my position. If so, think I won't be able to buy calls. If someone knows something about this, please share. Thanks!

Update2:
Since I couldn’t sleep previous night I passed out today.
My position was closed at 12:05pm (5 min candle). Unfortunately this Put went down rather much from it’s previous high (11:25am). It’s high was 3.8 at that time. But when price of the stock went down again Put price didn’t grow much and I’ve been able to close my position only for 2.23 and 2.28. My average price was 5.47.",2021-04-14,1149,637

The S&P 500 closed the shortened holiday week at new highs, up about 1.1%, about in line with the 1.1% the options market was pricing. With that, the VIX closed at 17.30, its lowest level in a year. 

**SPY** options are again pricing in about a **1.1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $396.50 to the downside and $405.50 on the upside. 

The expected move from **QQQ** options is about 1.7% for the week and **IWM** about 2.2%.

**In the News**

**Tesla (TSLA)** reported first quarter vehicle production numbers on Friday while equity markets were closed. Options are pricing in a roughly 6% move for the upcoming week, and about a 12% move for the month of April. The company is due to report earnings the last week of April. 

With the stock near $660, this week's expected move corresponds to about $620 for a bearish consensus and near $700 for bullish. That is much smaller expected moves being priced in TSLA options than what the stock has seen in recent week, both in its options and in its actual moves:

According to their valuation Tesla will hit 3T market cap and the price per share will be around 3000$ by 2025.

I have done another analysis for Tesla and I am totally with Cathie Woods, I might disagree about the time will take to Tesla to reach this capitalisation.

The thing is, I have never operated with options and I would like some advice about what strategy will be the best in this case.
And how much money do I need to earn a considerable amount of money if I this analysis is correct?

I know that if I buy some shares I could still earning some money, but it is moment to take some risk and try to get out of the mediocrity.

Lessons learned: I was patient, and got lucky. 
I was also too greedy with the last option and missed out on at least a grand. 
I was proud of my decision to pay for the trade and eliminate risk by selling my first 550 put in the 560 range, instead of getting too greedy and waiting for a drop that maybe doesn't come. It let me sit back and be a little more patient with the other contracts (too patient with 1).
All in all, I liked my put, it profited,though not perfect execution.  So many times I miss that golden window to sell and not get too greedy.

Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. 
- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it’s my biggest holding. It’s the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world’s most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I’m buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

With the exception of autonomous driving, EV manufacturing appears to have a low technology barrier to entry, that's why we have so many EV car companies pops up all over the world. Everybody used the same Total Addressable Market to justify their future value. I don't think autonomous driving is a must have in buying an EV, so the competition will be intense once all ICV companies start to produce their lineup of EVs in the near future.

Since Auto industry is a cyclical business, historically, the market value of the auto companies were somewhat depressed as compared to other high growth industries. Since there is a limit on how many cars will be sold in a year based on historical trends, I don't know how we can justify doubling or tripling the total market value of the whole auto industry unless all the non-Tesla companies lost significant amount of their market value, which is not likely (you are talking about fierce competitors like Toyota, Daimler, Honda, GM, etc)

The first movers (Tesla, BYDDY, Nio, Xpev) are catching all the investment dollars, driving their stock to current nose bleeding price.  Once all major car makers start to deliver EVs, supply and demand will determine their profit margin, future cash flow and true present value.

What do you think? How long will this EV mania last?",2021-01-07,1786,871

Would appreciate specific examples if you have any, thanks!",2020-12-31,957,1028
knz82h_TSLA,TSLA,Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,"A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

As information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. For example, Tesla believers (bloggers/Youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for Tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. While CEOs and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to SEC rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. The most prominent of this has perhaps been Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. She laid out the case for Tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as Tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of Tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. In a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. FOMO kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. Now, most Tesla bulls believe in the $7000 PT (pre-split) that Cathie Wood has put on this stock, and I doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. In 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. There has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with Tesla. Other examples of this include Rob Baron or Chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known Tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. This is no longer the case today. 

In a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. What a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. So even if Tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, I believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. ""Buy the dip"" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as Tesla. 

The bottom line is: As long as the story stays, the bubble of Tesla will not pop. Even if Tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, I very much think this will stand true. The only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. That can either be from investors such as ARK saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of Elon Musk. Otherwise, Tesla will very much continue to stand strong.",2020-12-31,14,281

What Happened: Wood, CEO of New York-based Ark Invest, said in a tweet Saturday night that Uber and Lyft missed out on a data opportunity that ties in to AI — and which companies will most benefit from it.

Wood said the ride-sharing companies ""stayed private too long and lost the plot. They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.""

The tweet was in response to a question about Ark Invest's portfolio.

And here's another article about it:
https://electrek.co/2020/12/01/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-merging-with-other-automakers-after-valuation-surge/

On the surface it seem to make a lot of sense. Tesla's market cap is at an all-time high and is now 3 times as large as the second largest automaker(Toyota) and close to 10 times as large as GM. Why not use this valuation to their advantage and greatly accelerate their manufacturing capabilities? Not only would they have physical access to more manufacturing, they'd also get a wealth of intellectual knowledge in terms of engineers and processes. Their supply chain would also see a boost from the other automakers existing agreements and relationships with vendors.

That is, the engineering capabilities they demonstrated on stage were explained somewhat not terribly, but still made sense to me. With that said, what did you guys think?

Also, some questions for the electrical engineers/others who have experience in this field - how viable and how possible does this innovation seem to you? Is this revolutionary as Elon is saying?

For everyone else, does this make anyone else feel like they are undervaluing TSLA? I mean, it definitely put some doubt in me as to my current valuation. This morning, if you had asked me, I would’ve definitely said yes. After watching this, I am not so sure. I might even increase the value of the company.  Now, I am an Elon fan but I also know his tendency to not follow through with deadlines, yet still succeeding massively due to his ability to build things from ground up (his first-principles .

iulj89_TSLA,TSLA,"$TSLA - Morgan Stanley previews Battery Day with ""7 Mind Blowing Things"" they're expecting","Morgan Stanley:

""Ahead of Tesla's Battery Day on Sep 22nd, we publish some expectation 'benchmarks' for scale, efficiency, cost and technology that we believe may come to light. Based on our work with our Asia Tech team, we expect the event to be potentially narrative changing for Tesla and the battery market.""

""Elon Musk has promised 'mind blowing' battery tech to be unveiled during the highly anticipated September 22nd Battery Day. Our key expectation benchmarks to look out for:

1. **Capacity. We are prepared for Tesla to target Terawatt scale battery capacity plans.** Currently, we forecast Tesla to produce 439 GwH of batteries for their in-house production and 3rd party supply (combined) by 2030, accounting for just over a 26% share of the global EV battery market. Will Tesla target 1TwH by 2035? Or more/sooner?
2. **Battery manufacturing/production efficiency… 16-fold improvement?** With Maxwell, there would be theoretically a 16x production capacity increase by skipping the wet toxic chemicals to create the cathode, which then has to be dried and baked-off and needs a lot of floor space and ovens to meet that process.
3. **A doubling of energy density?** Battery density using the DBE system shows greater than 300 Wh/kg with a path to over 500 Wh/kg. By comparison, Tesla's most advanced (2170) battery today is around 247 Wh/kg. This implies potential to add 20% to its current highest density and could double it in the future. This could lead to vehicles with significantly more range – and could potentially push Tesla Model 3 to about 400 miles per charge with upside from there.
4. **Longevity… 1 million mile battery.** Battery life also shows improved durability with almost 2x improvement as Elon Musk recently stated ‘…the car battery pack is around 3-to-5,000 miles, but the newly designed pack that will go into production for next year is design\[ed\] explicitly for a million miles of operation with minimum maintenance...’. Extension of battery life has implications for cost of ownership, warranty, 2nd/3rd life battery use and buying time to allow the battery recycling infrastructure to catch up.
5. **Goodbye Cobalt?** Tesla has been spending a great deal of effort on researching new chemistries themselves to reduce and remove cobalt from the mix. Tesla’s battery research group led by Jeff Dahn in Halifax applied for a patent in November 2017 that describes a new battery cell chemistry that would result in faster charging and discharging, better longevity, and even lower cost. This has important ESG considerations as well.
6. **Battery $/KwH Targets:** The prevailing view is that battery cell cost can decline at a compound rate of 6 to 7% from just over a $100/KwH level today. Could Tesla communicate plans to potentially double this rate of deflation or to target $50/KwH or less by mid or latter this decade due to the additive/compounding effects of their process efficiencies, scale and energy density improvements? Additionally, we are looking out for an evolution in battery format that could be cylindrical with bigger diameter than the 2170\[0\]’s. Tesla is building a pilot production line to test mass production.
7. **An expectation that Tesla could emerge as a full-stack battery competitor...** Overall, the market appears to be leaning towards Tesla being a faster moving partner with scale that expands the market for all and investors are likely looking to reengage on existing battery makers post the battery day. Investors will likely also be looking closely at the state of collaboration with CATL. The million mile battery or cobalt-free battery is also a pipeline of CATL’s new technology. Tesla and CATL could potentially own the patents of those new technologies together and CATL would potentially be able to help industrialize new battery production.""",2020-09-17,84,116

It doesn't matter what you think TSLA's valuation is because as long as Musk is running it it will continue to succeed IMO. Why? because of things like this:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-taps-market-rally-keg-145407552.html

Tesla did the same thing back in February, almost immediately after the stock hit $1000/share, and then priced the offering at $767 to raise $2 billion. A few months before that people were afraid they were going to have to file bankruptcy, but with that offering they rescued themselves and gleaned the cash they needed to keep going. Now, after a 5:1 split and another MASSIVE run to pre-split prices of almost $2.5k, ol musky boy files a $5 billion shelf which basically means they can now sell up to 5 billion in shares whenever they want. You better believe that a big chunk of this will be sold in the near future, and they will raise billions in cash at these ridiculous valuations. 

Musk is the definition of a capitalist and if you think TSLA is going down any time soon well ... you're gonna have a bad time. Offerings can push it down in the short term, but long term a TSLA with $5 billion more in cash is WAY stronger than the current TSLA.",2020-09-01,474,102

Builders at work.   
Tesla has released major announcements over 2019, with each leading to a major price action. Interestingly, some led to price plummets. 

Seemingly, it wasn't even the viral announcement of the Cybertruck that pushed the stock up. The rally began with Model X receiving the record scores in Europe. This is rationalized by the fact that European countries are adopting electric cars at a faster pace than even the US.

I posed two different models in the last 6 years that I'm continually revisiting and updating based on new data that's available to me.

Here's the first one below from 6 years ago where I attached a $450 price target by end of 2018
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&sh=78a9694b

Here's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&sh=43f78d64

It appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.

In no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.

See below model:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing

My broad assumptions:

* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028
* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric
* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year
* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model
* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025
* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin
* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY
* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network
* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto
* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028
* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028

That covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.

The price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.

Let me know your thoughts.

""From: Elon Musk

Date: Wed 5/22/2019 10:45 PM

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

If we rally hard, we can do it!

961270_TSLA,TSLA,Is Musk getting the Shorts to pay for TSLA going private?,"I think we may be about to witness the greatest financial judo move in recorded history: **Musk will make Tesla private and bury the Shorts, using their own money**. It will not cost him a dime. Detailed explanation below:

Why is this even conceivable? Because Tesla is the most shorted stock ever. There are more shorts to cover than shareholders who would prefer to cash-out at $420.

[Some TSLA data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/key-statistics/):

* Shares outstanding: 171M 
* Float: 127M shares, of which:
 * Musk: [34M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/insiders/musk-elon-831665)
 * Institutionals: 81M shares.

     Almost all of them (above 70M shares) are not prohibited from holding shares in a private company.
 * Other (incl retail investors): 12M shares.


      Note there aren't enough of those to significantly change the picture.

* Short interest: [35M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest)

Now let's *assume*: 

* This is real. Elon actually has someone willing to buy out any shareholder who doesn't want to, or cannot, go private, at $420.
* Most institutional investors will chose to remain with the privatized Tesla and not exit at $420.
* The board approves, and it goes to a shareholder vote, with a guaranteed 2/3rd majority of Musk and almost all the top institutionals.

What will happen? 

* You have 35M shorts to cover. Less than 35M shares to do that. Nobody will sell for less than the 420 they know they'll get anyway. Result: [Volkswagen-style short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen/short-sellers-make-vw-the-worlds-priciest-firm-idUSTRE49R3I920081028).
* Anybody who wants out can sell during the short squeeze. 
* If the squeeze goes high enough, some shareholders may change their mind and sell anyway. Probably all the shorts will be covered, but significantly north of 420.
* The only shareholders remaining after the squeeze are those who want to take their stocks into the private stage.

Result: There are no shareholders left that need to be bought out at $420. The short squeeze took care of those. Tesla goes private. Cost to Musk: ZERO.

A classic judo move - use your opponent's momentum against them.

I realize the above scenario sounds insane. But the logic is sound. Even if more institutionals want out, the short squeeze will take care of most of them, and the actual cost of privatization will be a small fraction of TSLA's valuation.

If you think this is BS, please explain why. ",2018-08-09,229,312

53hl5z_TSLA,TSLA,The SolarCity (SCTY) - Tesla (TSLA) merger might not actually go through...,"That's according to Wall Street itself, which is pricing SCTY stock at a huge discount to its takeout price. Under the terms of the buyout agreement, SCTY shareholders will receive 0.11 shares of TSLA for each SolarCity share they own. 

The math on that:
TSLA price (9/16 close): $205.40
Implied SCTY takeout price: $22.59 ($205.40 * 0.11)

SCTY price (9/16 close): $17.50.

So, SCTY is trading 23 percent below its takeout price, implying significant uncertainty. There are a few reasons for this, I leave it to you to decide how valid they are, but I just thought this was really interesting and a sort of under-covered topic. 

If you think the deal's gonna close in Q4, now might be a ripe time to load up on SolarCity. On the other hand, it's still dependent on Tesla's stock price, so you need to be somewhat confident that Tesla will remain stable for the next few months. 

Thoughts?

It’s as the great trader and “market wizard” Linda Bradford Raschke once said: “If you always take the buy signal sometimes you just get lucky.”

Get lucky? A dominant stock all last year, TSLA’s  stock success not only continues so far today but explodes to the upside. It is on a buy signal in three of my time frames — up 58 percent on the daily from 12/18/13, up 16.4 on the hourly signal from 2/20/14 (just three days ago), and up 9 percent from today’s open for a day trade.

1p1mj4_TSLA,TSLA,Why I wouldn't buy TSLA,"First of all, I would like to say that I support TSLA's ideas fully, I believe that we should start using electric cars. But these facts don't change the fact that I wouldn't buy TSLA for this simple reason: its overvalued. 

Currently TSLA has a market capitalization of $20B which isn't a huge number when you compare it to big players in the market such as GM, Honda or Ford which have $50B, $72B, $70B in respect but it is still a very huge number for a company who didn't made profit yet. And this number is an especially big number for a company that made $385M revenue in 2012 since this company also lost $396M.

I know making loses is part of the R&D process and tsla might start the reap the fruits of the money spent on R&D with its new products. Lets be over optimistic and say that they will be making 100x more money than they used to by next year this time and will generate a revenue of $40B. $110B shy from GM's revenue in year 2012. And also in order to generate this revenue they would have to sell 363,000 cars(based on model s85p price of 110). Which is highly unlikely considering tesla was planning to create 800 model s's by late 2014. 

This is why I wouldn't buy tsla at its current price point. I think they have a great idea, a great business plan and they might have great products, but they're too expensive to be a sound investment. 

**Fun fact:** Ellon Musk has 5 million something stock options in his company. Although I don't know their price points I would say they are pretty low considering they were isssued in 2012
