1khs1p5_GOOGL,GOOGL,TTWO and 1TTWO and a generalized question regarding ticker info,"Hi all,

I was looking at tickets for the company take two interactive and found two tickers in one specific broker I use:
TTWO and 1TTWO.
My questions are: why is 1TTWO there, why is it suffixed with a 1 and what is the reason that it’s listed on an Italian stock exchange, whereas TTWO is listed on Nasdaq?

The generalized question that arose for me is, where do you find stock listing information? obviously googling tickets themselves leads to massive amounts of stock sites with general stock information, but not information regarding the listing itself.
I keep running into questions regarding listings and then find it hard to figure out what/why/when.

Thanks!",2025-05-08,0,0

1k2llcw_TTWO,TTWO,TTWO so strong even through tariffs,"Honestly, this is not a spam post. TTWO reconfirmed on their last earnings call that GTA6 is still on track to release in fall of 25. I feel strongly that the market hasn't priced in the games release, far from it! This will be the largest video game release in history. I don't people realize how massive this game is going to be, how much hype is behind it, and how much gaming has grown since the release of GTA5, in 2013. Covid and the new generation has sent gaming and technology to new levels. Not to mention micro transactions in game. I'm in pretty big on 2027 leaps, around the 200 strike and intend to get more along the way. Keeping cash available for any market dumps caused by global trade turmoil but I think the stock can easily hit $300 a share. Relatively small float as well. Any thoughts are welcome.

1fjfdc4_TTWO,TTWO,"Report on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO)","**Report on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO)**

**Company Overview**  
Take-Two Interactive is one of the leading global developers and publishers of video games, known for popular franchises such as *Grand Theft Auto* and *NBA 2K*. Its business is divided into the creation of interactive content for consoles, PC, and mobile devices. The company operates through key subsidiaries like Rockstar Games, 2K, Zynga, and Private Division. It has a strong presence in digital distribution, which accounts for over 96% of its revenues​​.

**Recent Financial Performance**  
In the second fiscal quarter of 2024, Take-Two reported revenues of $1,338.2 million, representing a 4.2% increase compared to the previous year. However, the company registered a net loss of $262 million, an increase from the $206 million loss reported the previous year. This was largely due to rising marketing and development costs, partly driven by the launch of new titles, including Zynga's *Match Factory!*​.

**Revenue and Margin Analysis**  
Recurring consumer spending (virtual content and microtransactions) represents 82% of total revenue, highlighting the importance of in-game transactions as a key driver. By platform, mobile devices generate 54% of revenues, with consoles and PCs capturing 38% and 8%, respectively.  
In terms of margins, the gross margin improved to 57.6% in Q2 2024 due to lower royalty costs and reduced amortization of intangible assets. However, the operating margin remains negative at -13.7%, reflecting continued pressure on profitability from high operating and development costs.

**Growth Prospects**  
The company has a strong pipeline of future releases, including high-profile titles like *Grand Theft Auto VI*, expected in 2025, which is projected to significantly boost revenues. Additionally, Zynga’s integration strengthens its position in the lucrative mobile gaming market. Despite current losses, Take-Two is expected to achieve annual revenue growth between 5% and 7% over the next few years​​.

**Risks and Challenges**  
Key risks include high industry competition, fluctuations in consumer demand, and potential regulatory changes affecting game monetization. Moreover, high player acquisition costs and the development of AAA titles may further pressure future margins​​.

**Stock Valuation**  
The current stock price of $152.71 appears slightly overvalued, with an estimated intrinsic value close to $145 based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Despite current losses, the company has a solid product base and a strategic cost-reduction plan that could improve long-term profitability​.

**Recommendation**  
Given the current context, the recommendation is to **wait before investing**. While future growth appears promising, short-term risks like continued losses and stock overvaluation suggest that a price correction could offer a better entry opportunity​.

**Conclusion**  
Take-Two Interactive boasts a robust portfolio and a strong position in the gaming market, but it faces short-term operational and profitability challenges. In the long term, the release of *Grand Theft Auto VI* and its focus on recurring digital content could provide sustained growth​.

1alz60l_TTWO,TTWO,Calls on $TTWO earnings tonight - brief DD inside,"This might be kind of a risky play since shares in Take Two have run up a lot since their last earnings, but I’m going to buy a few calls for their earnings tonight.

On their last earnings calls, they predicted that full-year bookings for GTA Online for the fiscal year 2024 (which runs from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024) would be flat year-over-year compared to fiscal year 2023 (which runs from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023). In reality, after a game update released in December 2023, they saw a pretty big increase in both average and Peak Players on PC, according to Steamcharts. Although the effect is decreasing now (as would be expected) it has continued to perform better in February 2024 than February 2023, with 201,200 peak players so far compared to 174,026 last year.


Anecdotally, the same is happening on Playstation, although that’s based on Ps-timetracker.com, which only contains a small sample size of roughly 7k players who opt in voluntarily to have their playtime tracked. Nevertheless, the trend matches that seen on PC.
 

As the release of GTA 6 has been all but confirmed for January – March 2025 (based on TTWO’s own financial projections), I expect GTA 5 to continue picking up steam as 2024 goes on.

On the mobile side, the recent Zynga release Match Factory (released on November 1, 2023, right around the time they held their last earnings call) seems to be performing extremely well and has overtaken Empires & Puzzles (red line on the chart), which was previously the highest grossing iPhone game in their portfolio. Since Zynga makes up roughly 50% of the company’s net bookings, this could make a pretty significant difference to earnings.",2024-02-08,10,30
18u8kwc_TTWO,TTWO,Take-Two Interactive(TTWO) DCF Analysis: GTA VI,"***Note All Personal Opinion, not Financial Advice.***

# Introduction:

Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has recently announced the release of GTA VI almost a decade after the initial release of GTA V. On top of that, their acquisition of Zynga has created a new frontier in the mobile gaming space for them to conquer. TTWO is a company that creates a few strong IPs that they will monetize for decades to come in the form of Downloadable Content (DLC), where DLC is not a necessity rather it is simply a way to enhance the experience. However, given their usual model going forward, there is a lot of uncertainty as we're unsure of how GTA VI will be positioned in their ecosystem of IPs, how the advertising revenue from Zynga will look like, and how much cost savings/efficiencies can be realized from their merger with Zynga.

# Revenue:

TTWO has 2 revenue streams, “Recurrent Consumer Spending” and “Full Games and Others”.

Recurrent Consumer Spending refers to DLCs

Full Games and Others refers to Full Game sales and Advertising.

I split Full Games and Others further into Full Game Sales and Advertising.

When forecasting Full Game sales, I took TTWO’s most popular title GTA V as a proxy for games sold across all platforms ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1247955/gta-v-unit-sales-worldwide-total/)) and how profitable games will be for video game sales. The rationale lies in the difficulty in estimating the total copies of video games sold across all of TTWO’s subsidiaries.  Management has stated ""12 titles in fiscal '24, 36 in the following two years.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference."" TTWO expects to release a higher-than-average amount of titles from 2025 to 2026(36 in the following two years), so I’d assume that copies sold tend higher than average in these 2 years and remain elevated for 3 years for the novelty of the games to die down.

When forecasting Revenue/Copies, I assumed that management keeps prices more or less at the same prices. So, I only accounted for half of the perpetual inflation in the sales price of games sold to reflect the lack of pricing power game studios have when selling their games. “The industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power"" - 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference.

When forecasting Recurrent Consumer Spending, I used GTA V as a benchmark again, taking the running count of GTA V copies sold. As TTWO switches gear to be more focused on DLC, especially with their Zynga acquisition. With the elevated release of new games, I’d assume that DLC spend remains in line with inflation for the duration of high growth for copies sold. DLC begins to increase towards the end of my forecast period as gamers become more well-acquainted with certain flagship titles e.g. GTA VI and are more willing to spend on DLC.

When forecasting Advertising, given that this is a new arm of the business for TTWO as it came from the Zynga acquisition. Not much information was given so to avoid being overly optimistic I forecasted it in line with inflation.

# Cost:

Overall, When forecasting any cost item I took into account the fact that costs are elevated for TTWO due to their merger with Zynga. The costs will not tend back to FY22’s level as they now have to support the operations from Zynga. However, I believe that the merger may have led to some cost savings in the later parts of my forecast.

When forecasting COGS, I took into account “jobs can be made a whole lot easier and more efficient by developments in AI, and we're certainly looking forward to that. And as I said, we're already putting it in practice every day.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. TTWO has large faith & investment in AI which could lower production costs. So going forward I assumed that COGS tended downwards slightly.

When forecasting Marketing, I assumed that marketing remains elevated for FY24 - FY27 where TTWO will have the largest growth in copies sold due to their large amounts of new games released. Afterward, I assume that marketing tapers down but remains slightly elevated to continuously raise awareness for their IPs.

When forecasting R&D, opting for less granularity I assumed that R&D expenditure slightly tapers downwards before remaining constant throughout my forecast.

When forecasting G&A, I took into account “operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year over year, driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost-savings initiatives.” 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference. To avoid being overly granular I assumed G&A will not taper downwards too much and it takes 4 years for TTWO to be rid of any inefficiencies.

When forecasting Others,  opting for less granularity I assumed that Others remain constant throughout my forecast.

&#x200B;

# CapEX and D&A:

When forecasting CapEX and D&A, I took into account historical ROIC and %Earnings Reinvested. I'd assume that the D&A is elevated due to the amortization of intangible assets from the Zynga merger. So, in perpetuity, this elevated number from FY2023 will smoothen out.Sanity Check: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/qDVtn0k)\]

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value TTWO at $133.14/share. However, in my best case, I value TTWO at $213.03/share  I believe the discrepancy between the forecasted price and the actual stock price lies in the uncertainty of how TTWO will move forward. There are a few questions such as how well will their new IPs e.g. GTA VI in FY24 and FY25 perform, how will the cost savings from the Zynga merger materialize, and what advertising revenue from Zynga will look like. Due to the recency of the merger as well, there isn't a large number of well-established historical data to base numbers on so that could also lead to over-optimism. However, I believe in the strength of TTWO's expected IPs and the mobile gaming space is rapidly expanding especially given the rising prevalence of smartphones in developing markets, these smartphones serve as their first introduction to online gaming. But, due to the extreme volatility and uncertainty, I did not want to be overly optimistic.

17qrtyt_TTWO,TTWO,Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has tremendous risks. And why GTA 6 is an even bigger deal than you think,"TTWO jumped on news of GTA 6 release, and it may seem obvious, but let's figure out why this matters to analysts so much.

Founded in 1993, Take-Two consists of three wholly owned labels, Rockstar Games, 2K, and Zynga. The firm is one of the world's largest independent video game publishers on consoles, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. Take-Two's franchise portfolio is headlined by ""Grand Theft Auto"" (345 million units sold) and contains other well-known titles such as ""NBA 2K,"" ""Civilization,"" ""Borderlands,"" ""Bioshock,"" and ""Xcom."" Zynga mobile titles include ""Farmville,"" ""Empires & Puzzles,"" and ""CSR Racing.""

They have had a checkered EPS history, with low and wildly varying EPS from year to year.

Year         EPS

2023 (TTM)	-$7.29

2022	-$2.25

2021	$4.56

2020	$4.31

2019	$2.98

2018	$3.24

2017	$1.73

2016	$0.17

2015	-$3.68

2014	-$0.90

2013	$4.01 (GTA V Release)

**Sony Acquisition**

Let's make one thing clear - an acquisition by Sony is clearly their only way to return capital to their shareholders.  They have been courted by Sony in the past, and more recently under dubious circumstances it was ""leaked"" that they were going to be acquired by Sony for an estimated $20 billion. This has proven to be false, per Sony. However, Sony is the ONLY possible acquirer of a company like TTWO, and so let's figure out how a sale to Sony could occur.

The most recent sale of Activision to Microsoft gives us the most recent multiple for a potential sale to Sony. Activision sold with a sale price of $68.7 billion, with a TTM revenue of $7.528 billion. This gives us a revenue multiple of \~9.12x.

Bungie was acquired by Sony in 2022 for $3.6 billion, with revenue of only $200 million, implying a multiple of 18x. This comes with a heavy asterisk of analysts saying that they vastly overpaid, which is true by our other examples below.

Zynga was also bought by TTWO for $9.5 billion on $2.8 billion of revenue, giving us a multiple of 3.4x.

Epic Games' June 2020 financing valued it at $17 billion based on an estimated $5 billion in revenue, which is also a 3.4x revenue multiple.

Electronic Arts trades at approx a 4.5x revenue.

Playdemic was acquired by EA for $1.4 billion, with revenue of $211 million in revenue, giving us a multiple of 6.6x.

If we were to assume that TTWO sells to Sony based on their TTM revenue of $5.35 billion with a floor multiple of 3.40x and a high multiple of 9.12x, this gives us potential sales prices of between $18.2 billion and $48.8 billion, quite a range but plenty of more room on the upside. Compare this with their current $22.8 billion market cap.

However, there are a few things wrong with this assumption, namely GTA 6 and Sony itself.

Firstly, the multiples we established were based on TTWO's TTM revenue, which doesn't take into account a massive title release like GTA6 that would not be captured in their revenue. In fairness, neither does any of the other mulitples we used. However, I would ask you about Epic Games, Zynga, EA, Bungie, and even Activision... did they have any titles coming out (before their sale) that are as hotly anticipated as GTA6? The answer is no, and so I think it is fair to not give as much weight to the floor as we should to our ceiling price.

Secondly, and most importantly, a potential sale can only occur if Sony has the resources to fund it. And my fat conclusion is **no. They cannot buy it.** Firstly, while the MSFT acquisition of Activision has opened up the acquisition from the regulatory side, Sony simply does not have the funds or the ability to acquire it. They only have a cash balance $14 billion.

And if you don't believe me, their CFO stated their company has only around $5 billion left to spend for acquisitions, which means they are most likely in the hunt focusing on smaller studios. They don't have the warchest of MSFT.

What this means for TTWO is that they have no possible exit unless Sony's cash pile swells to a significant degree, because there are simply no other possible acquirers. And importantly, TTWO **simply does not generate significant free cash flow to their shareholders.**

TTWO has to rely on cash flow generated from operations because they will not have a reasonable exit in the next 5-10 years. This means GTA6 and their other upcoming titles have to do a lot of work to bide them time for a Sony acquisition. No one thinks GTA6 is going to flop, but this industry has been mired in flops the last few years from major studios.

Don't take it from me, take it from their 10-K:

""Grand Theft Auto and certain of our other titles, such as Red Dead Redemption or NBA 2K, are ""hit"" products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. Grand Theft Auto products contributed 14.6% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and the five best-selling franchises (including Grand Theft Auto), which may change year over year, in the aggregate accounted for 52.9% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful ""hit"" titles or sequels to such ""hit"" titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our ""hit"" titles or their sequels, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially, and we may incur losses.""

**Conclusion:**

GTA 6 is even a bigger deal than you think. If this flops, they don't make money. TTWO right now is a bet on GTA 6, full stop because they have no alternative but to continue independently, with no prospect of any suitors. They have to continue to deliver on big titles every single year.

Their historical EPS doesn't suggest a market cap of anywhere near $24 billion, even taking into account post GTA 5 years. There is tremendous risk at these prices in this company, it assumes they will never produce a flop.

12zs8jq_TTWO,TTWO,Is TTWO undervalued? How to profit off of GTA 6's impending announcement & release...,"By all accounts, it is incredibly likely that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be getting announced within the next year, potentially much sooner than that, and getting released within the next few years.

Take Two Interactive (TTWO) is the parent company of Rockstar Games, the developer of Grand Theft Auto games. TTWO also owns the developer of the worlds most popular Basketball series NBA2K. However, my thesis for the stock is based on the upcoming announcement and eventual release of Grand Theft Auto 6.

The company TTWO is currently valued at a market cap of 20 billion. For comparisons sake, this is less than one third of Activision Blizzard - the company that owns the developers of games such as Call of Duty and Diablo. Whilst these games are huge, no single entry in any of these games has ever come close in sales to the latest Grand Theft Auto release, Grand Theft Auto 5. In fact, Grand Theft Auto 5 is currently the second highest sold video game of all time, a close second to Minecraft.

For all of Grand Theft Auto 5's success, I believe the next entry in the game is likely to break its records. Despite the developers silence, the future release is very widely discussed, and I think it is fair to say that it is one of the most anticipated games, if not THE most anticipated game, in history. Everyone and their mother has heard of the Grand Theft Auto series, and after the success of GTA 5, there is no doubt that everyone will be rushing to buy GTA 6 when it is finally released. Both Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive will also know exactly how to cash in on the eventual success of the next entry, as they have with GTA 5 - they will milk every penny out of the player base in the form of paid DLC & online add-ons.

For the argument that GTA 6 is already ""priced in"" to TTWO stock, I find this argument unconvincing. Currently, TTWO is trading at around the same levels it was almost 6 years ago. In addition, one could have made the same argument about GTA 5 being priced in 10 years ago, yet upon the release of the game the share price had a steady climb and ended up almost doubling a year after its release. Unlike games such as Call of Duty which come out every year, I do not believe that the release of future GTA iterations is priced in to the stock at all times. These games come out very infrequently (see how its already been 10 years since the last entry in the series), and what is more, it is much less clear what to expect from each iteration.

qlzhtq_TTWO,TTWO,[DD inside] Short $TTWO - MAKE BANK 🚀🚀🚀,"EDIT: apparently I was wrong + I'm retarded.  Stock went up AH.  Doesnt matter if revenue declines + MAU is declining + revenues decreasing YoY + games delayed +guidance is lower. It was priced in. 5% CAGR growth on a 30 PE stock.

&#x200B;

I might be retarded, but yesterday, $ATVI, who owns a bunch of steady franchises, from the very popular CoD Warzone and somehow, Candy Crush and other candy based shit, met earnings, steady user base, guided slightly lower, and got destroyed after hours. like massacred after it announced some release delays that might be pushed to 2023. Sure, some games got delayed, blah blah, who cares.

$ATVI has a PE of 19\~ now after earnings.

Lets compare to $TTWOs overall picture. It's got one side of things, basketball, civ6, bioshock, some mobile games. Basically games people played a year ago and stopped playing recently.

It's main revenue stream is users playing GTAV.

[https://steamcharts.com/app/271590#1y](https://steamcharts.com/app/271590#1y)

They've been milking the GTA5 community for a long time, years. Then Covid hit, everyone plays more GTA5, management are geniuses! Now that COVID is over, the milks gone bad, people are leaving their house again, they're stuck with their pants down with declining user growth.

It's nearly half of what it was last year, yet its only 8% down from February highs. In peak November, we're at like 120k users instead of last years 258k users. that's a loss of like 60% YoY for the same time.

So what could make the stock go up after hours? maybe some GTA6 news? Seems unlikely, reports are out that suggest 2024/2025 release date. Wait 4-5 years for a new GTA6? Investors can't even fathom waiting until 2023 on a 19 PE $ATVI.

[https://www.techradar.com/news/gta-6-release-date-of-2025-seems-more-likely-after-new-reports](https://www.techradar.com/news/gta-6-release-date-of-2025-seems-more-likely-after-new-reports)

My expectations are lower guidance, lower monthly active users, and not enough shit in the near term pipeline to justify a valuation +50% higher than $ATVI. I love rockstar games, but it has to come down to the valuation of its peers when its got both declining MAU, declining revenue and small pipeline.

&#x200B;

Disclosure: My position is a FD, 1 put at 185$ strike, expiring in 2 days. I'm expecting a fall down to the $160-175 range, hopefully more after tonight.  I half expect to lose it because I've been frequently wrong recently, but also every earnings seems to punish stocks in the last 2 weeks, so why not $TTWO?

# My Conclusion

 

>**Activision** has many good qualities investors look for in an investment. It has very **popular franchises** that sell all across the world. It has a large player base of over **400 million monthly active users,** Over the last year, the company generated a healthy **free cash flow margin of 33%.**  
beyond their current operation ATVI is looking to getting themselves into **mobile gaming business.**  
>  
>even though ATVI seems like the natural choice the **bad sentiment** that follows the company might effect sales as more gamers **ban their products.**

&#x200B;

>On the other side **Take-Two** is much smaller and is more dependent on a few franchises like **Rockstar and 2K** , Since *Grand Theft Auto V* launched in 2013, Take-Two's **free cash flow has increased by 347% to $843 million.**   
>  
>Take-Two's **EPS is expected to decline** this year due to the investments in marketing, personnel, IT, and developers, which in a matter of growth, i**nvesting in recruiting is very important**, more over we can see that even in the R&D expanses growth in the last year TTWO surpassed ATVI,  
>  
>**To sum in all up**, in my opinion, **TTWO has the upper hand in this battel.**

# My Conclusion

>**Activision** has many good qualities investors look for in an investment. It has very **popular franchises** that sell all across the world. It has a large player base of over **400 million monthly active users,** Over the last year, the company generated a healthy \*\*free cash flow margin of 33%.\*\*beyond their current operation ATVI is looking to getting themselves into **mobile gaming business.**  
>  
>even though ATVI seems like the natural choice the **bad sentiment** that follows the company might effect sales as more gamers **ban their products.**

&#x200B;

>On the other side **Take-Two** is much smaller and is more dependent on a few franchises like **Rockstar and 2K** , Since *Grand Theft Auto V* launched in 2013, Take-Two's **free cash flow has increased by 347% to $843 million.**  
>  
>Take-Two's **EPS is expected to decline** this year due to the investments in marketing, personnel, IT, and developers, which in a matter of growth, i**nvesting in recruiting is very important**, more over we can see that even in the R&D expanses growth in the last year TTWO surpassed ATVI,  
>  
>**To sum in all up**, in my opinion, **TTWO has the upper hand in this battel.**

oyn6oa_TTWO,TTWO,Take two interactive Software ($TTWO) recent price movements.,"So basically: I impulsively bought into TTWO, when it was at $183. Now it has gone down significantly despite a solid earnings report. I still have some faith in the company and expect some big upcoming game announcements in the coming 1-2years so I'm holding on. However I do not fully understand the recent price-movements of the stock. Can anyone explain why the price suddenly dipped so heavily after the earnings-report? The earnings report was exactly as I expected it to be and nothing seemed wrong with it. 

Also is this a bad investment? I plan to hold this position for 1-2years until I can get an opportunity to sell. I am pretty new to investing in the market. Have been investing in funds/etf's for years though.",2021-08-05,3,5

**When Do I Close The Trade?**

The market is in a peculiar place. If you lean towards playing growth names in tech you'll probably notice many of the tickers on your list are still down about 30-40% from their highs in February. What's the market done since then? Most indices are at all-time-highs. How does that make sense?

Over the last several months there's been a significant rotation into financial services, energy stocks, and industrial materials. Recently, those sectors have pulled back while the overall market continues to rip higher.

I do see some risk when I look at charts such as SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc. A broad (and healthy) market pull-back might affect many stocks on my watchlist, unfortunately this also includes the ones that are still down 40% from recent highs.

None-the-less, timing the market is something I am not very good at, but one of my particular skills is buying the @\*#&ing dip, a la Buffet style. I've got a few stocks on my radar for this week.

Before I get into them, people often ask me when do I decide to sell my position. This is something that can't be easily answered. Speaking from my own perspective, I generally give myself a minimum timeframe of how long I expect to hold a stock versus holding until a short-term price target. This time-frame is at least 6 months because I want to be able to say “This company is trading at X, but in 1 year I believe it will be Y”.

For example, SOFI is a ticker that in my opinion is in the early stages of growth. I would be comfortable holding this name for 2-3 years or until something fundamentally changes with the business that has me doubting it's future. It’s at $16 now. Do I think it has potential to be $35-40 by this time next year? Yes. Does that mean if it short-squeezes to $25 next week I might also sell it? Yes.

BlackBerry on the other hand, could be a mixture of both price targets and durational hold. Everyone is betting on BB’s turnaround story, which might happen depending on how strong their integration of their IVY platform is with new vehicles and EVs. This is something that could play out 1-2 years from now, but it might also participate in a squeeze next week that could drive the price way above fair value.

When a stock price becomes detached from reality and what I believe to be ""fair value"" is when I like to take some off the table or exit my position. Every investor manages and reacts to risk differently, so it’s also about finding what works for you.

&#x200B;

Before we get into the tickers for this week here's a breakdown of some of my charting rules and terminology.

&#x200B;

**Chart Guidelines & Terms**

I use the term ""meme stock"" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.

&#x200B;

Moving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.

""Red Zones"" are high-risk lotto plays.

""Orange Zones"" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.

""Green Zone"" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.

&#x200B;

As always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.

# The Meme List

**Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)**

Industry: Steel

Steel has had a huge role in the ""rebuild better"" idea as well as being an inflation play. Steel prices have soared and producers have not been able to keep up with demand. In my opinion this demand is more than cyclical (short-term rotation) and could be a continued trend in the future.

CLF has already seen some huge gains YTD where it doubled in price. After hitting $24 a share it's hit a roadblock, but could be primed for another move up after this recent consolidation.

&#x200B;

**BABA Holdings (BABA)**

Industry: e-commerce giant (China)

BABA is one of the most under-valued stocks of all time. This was on track for $400 a share last year until a lot of uncertainties around China began to surface. There is a massive crackdown on Chinese stocks going on and this is a risky play, nonetheless I do like where it's currently trading and technically might be at the base of a cup and handle chart pattern. This ticker has been known to pick up on a lot of social media hype as well which could be the fuel needed for a moon mission.

&#x200B;

**Tilray (TLRY)**

Industry: Cannabis

Anyone who was around in 2018 saw this name at $150 a share, looking back I still can’t believe it. At $14 a share this is a different story. TLRY is trading at 6-month lows with the possibility for another chance at a squeeze. IMO could be a decent play if you are patient enough to wait for it.

&#x200B;

# The BTFD List

**Air BNB (ABNB)**

Industry: Lodging

ABNB was seeing volatile price action post-IPO with almost weekly 25% swings. After peaking at nearly $220 per share, it is currently down about 40% in the $140 range. You’ll notice the orange zone I highlighted from April, which could have shown to be a good entry point, but wasn’t (as does happen). At $140 a share I like this name based off their branding and as a re-opening play.

&#x200B;

**Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)**

Industry: Video Games

TTWO is a lockdown play that will still continue to see success as the world re-opens. Video games have gained popularity with streamers leading the way. Grand Theft Auto 5, created by TTWO, is the second most successful video game of all time, losing the number 1 spot to Minecraft. It is rumored that GTA 6 is to come out sometime at the end of 2021 or 2022. Which is already priced in, but might be a catalyst should the brand see a strong launch.

My imaginary green zone is very close to the current stock price. I’d rather be early than late so I might nibble on a position next week.

&#x200B;

**Biogen (BIIB)**

Industry: Drug Manufacturer

This ticker has come up frequently on some of my social checks. I can’t say I know much about BIIB, but the stock ripped +80% in early June and has since cooled off. Any time a stock goes up that much in such a short amount of time there is going to be huge volatility. IMO there might be more downside to the trend-line and channel at $280, but I think there could be a good entry sometime soon or even at current levels.

**Option Idea:** 3/19 $200 Strike at 8.25  
Thesis: If TTWO moves back toward the top of the recent channel, it will tag 210-211. This will give almost 80% gain. 

**Pros**: Gaming stocks are generally strong right now, and TTWO is near the bottom of the channel. It might take a week or so. 

**Cons:** The 204.20 resistance looks like a real SOB. Gotta break it. Be careful here. Don't hold a loser, but expect some struggle. 

You could get ballsy with a same week expiration, but I would be very careful. A bad overnight can demolish any gains. TTWO also has typically bad OI, so stick to the 200 or 210 strikes for 3/19.

i2d6im_TTWO,TTWO,TTWO and DIS next week.,"**Monday 8.3 AH, Take Two earning. Tuesday 8.4 AH, Disney earning. Assuming Macro does not fuck up in next two weeks, both stocks are likely to go up.**

Disclosure: I currently hold TTWO 3-week ITM call + Disney September OTM call at 120. Plan to hold them til expiration.

&#x200B;

**Why TTWO:** Let us face it. Economy sucks, virus is rampant, Fed Brrr will continue, stonk only go up, and investors is in maniac of any growth story...

Gaming industry will prosper for a long time with virus existence, and very resistant to economy downturn. EA earning is fucking insane last week, 30% beat on revenue and 60% beat on EPS and raised guidance. TTWO and Activation Blizzard are almost certainly a beat. Why pick TTWO? Fundamentally, Take Two has the best products --- Rockstar never disappoints & arguably the best studio in the world, and GTA & Red Dead Online will keep generating insane returns for years. Technically, it has highest PE ratio. And we all know what this means --- **so long revevue growth continues, high PE leads to even higher PE, and negative PE leads to even more negative PE!**

Fact: TTWO rises better than EA after EA's awesome earning!

If TTWO also beats earning / profit / guidance by >30%, stock will easily moon another 10% in a few trading days. The only caveat is stock already rises quite a lot during this quarter, which is why I feel ITM call (or selling put, or stock) is safer than OTM call, in case the beat is not that large & stock rises more gradually.

&#x200B;

**Why DIS:** the stock is technically in a turning point right now --- low volume and narrow trading range for weeks. Yes parks revenue will suffer, yes movie theater will close for a while. But does it matter???? People say the same negative things when SPY was at 220, and stock only rebound when all bad things are priced in. DIS is one of the rare stocks that is still very undervalued, but at the same time has strong growth potential. All bad things are priced in for DIS, and stock can easily moon for a blowout Disney + subscription, or virus treatment / vaccine outlook from now to year end.

Why buy before earning: they will disclose most up-to-date Disney + subscription number then. If the subscription number tops 80M or higher, that is a 150% increase vs Q1 number (Q1 3.31 has 33M or so; by 5.5 Q1 report they said 55M; so 80M at 8.4 seems likely). Revenue / earning / cash are not going to matter (so long it is not too bad). The Disney + growth is the real catalyst that may push stock back to 130 or even 150 during August / September.  All it matters is whether Disney + growth is strong enough, so the company can be viewed as a tech / growth stock --- when analysts started claiming TSLA is tech not auto, stock tripled from there....Plus, DIS OTM options are dirt cheap right now.

PS: some may say NFLX didn't rise after ER, but NFLX rised >50% already during Q2; and NFLX is in fact still stable after issuing a bad Q3 guidance

PPS: irrelevant, just a shoutout to this hidden gem I saw Friday in this sub --- big upside and low downside play as a Pharma company: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0mzmy/the\_next\_yolo\_for\_500\_profit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0mzmy/the_next_yolo_for_500_profit/) ARK holds about 1% of RDHL. Enough said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update 1:

TTWO rocks. Hope you all enjoy the tendies. ITM call or selling puts absolutely prints. If OTM call, better sell tomorrow due to potential IV crush or pullback.

Tomorrow onto DIS. OTM call has a chance to print huge depending on market reaction to Disney + subscription.

&#x200B;

Update 2:

DIS is flying for now. Earning is mediocre, but people like its transition to streaming company. Disney + will offer premium access for Mulan and new movies starting September. Absolutely huge.

&#x200B;

Both picks work great this time. Hope some of you make tendies. Will post again in the future for any low-risk & high upside ER play.",2020-08-02,20,24

Seeking lolpha lied about the date of this article being from today, it's old, my bad. I figured that site getting news early was a red flag.

\------------------

[https://www.sporttechie.com/nfl-partnership-2k-new-football-video-games](https://www.sporttechie.com/nfl-partnership-2k-new-football-video-games)

>The NFL has announced a partnership with Take-Two Interactive brand 2K to produce multiple future video games in what will mark a return of football-themed games to the 2K brand. The deal revives a previous partnership that has been inactive since 2004 and promises non-simulation football game experiences that will begin launching in 2021.

TTWO end of day at 4:30pm will skyrocket.

Even modest gamers that aren't sports fans knows about the EA NFL deal, which took **NFL competition away and only allowed EA to make NFL games with brands** (otherwise you had to make up your own teams like the Washington WSB lolcalls, vs. the Deported Chicago Bearingtons)

NBA however, did not let EA grab the exclusive license, and as a result **EA's NBA live lost marketshare overtime to 2k's NBA2k,and went on break for years, than coming back reformatted, flopped, and is now on absence again.**

With Madden bumbling many of the last 10 NFL games, including the 25th anniversary edition which was terrible an sold like crap, **it seems that the time of EA exclusivity has come to an end**. People will ***buy the new 2K NFL games in droves***, and unless EA spends more money and changes strategies, their Madden series will end up just like NBA live.

**This also shows that the NFL has seen the sales numbers and performance of TTWO games compared to EA,** to want to break off the deal. Not only do 2K games, especially sports games, sell well, ***but in game purchases are often much more than what you see from EA across all genres***\*\*.\*\*

This is a money making deal for TTWO and a bad nightmare for EA, buy your calls for TTWO, and your Puts for EA for maximum earnings.",2020-05-20,0,18
gncimb_TTWO,TTWO,"Will Take-Two Interactive|$TTWO (Ripper, GTA, NBA 2K) follow Activision and rise after earnings, or will it drop like a tank in the ocean?","Take Two $TTWO is in a very interesting position and so are last second investors that haven't jumped in yet, ahead of todays after-close 4:30pm earnings call.

Take Two is a very strange and inconsistent stock. The assumption is that due to covid, and new user numbers help this, that Take Two's 4Q results will blow it out the park, have ""holiday numbers"" they say, and it will skyrocket the stock price (at least for some days).

The issue is this is Take-Two, and you can see the early chart movements this morning showing how uncertain people are to just buy and rise the stock into earnings.

Take-Two has a very well-known history of mismanaging money, and while they are MUCH better now than they were years ago it's still a concern. In a years back in the day, when GTAV online was new, NBA and other sports sales doubled, and several original projects took off, many with microtransactions, Take-Two still lost a ton of money and the stock dropped. That's not the first time that happened either.

Fast forward to 2020, and people are still skeptical. But I myself have already dropped in because there are two factors that may help people relax about the earnings.

One is the amount of new users, and thus microtransaction gains have always been double to 4x more than Activisions or EA's the last 3 years **CONSISTENTLY**, and assuming that stays the same as we add in covid shut-ins, this should continue or be even higher. Considering how much Activision smashed this helps make it so that it's very likely TTWO will smash.

The second is that TTWO always adjusts and cuts down operations for the slow season, which for TTWO is generally Q4. But with the rise in spending, **this means that they are receiving a ton of extra revenue that they were never accounting for that basically adds up to free cash** thanks to the covid/sars 2 pandemic, and considering TTWO is a Worldwide brand with worldwide Ips, that means they got a ton of profits unexpected during the off-season WORLDWIDE.

So if you wanna bet on a potential winner with a likely HUGE jump in stock price for the next few days I'd jump in within the next hour or so before the premiums shoot up too high. 

Though some people believe it will drop like a tank in water, these analysts haven't really given compelling reasons though outside the history I mentioned earlier.",2020-05-20,3,22

Popularity as a proxy for revenue?

&#x200B;

Interestingly, Borderlands 2 and Civ 5 are still in the top 100 most active games on Steam, despite their sequels being out. I have no way of figuring out DLC sales, so I’d assume that these games also have additional sales based on that. There’s also GTA online, NBA 2k online, and Red Dead online, all of which are fairly popular. TakeTwo has other games as well, but these are the most popular. Clearly, GTA V is their bread and butter, but NBA and RDR2 are doing fairly well. GTA V is also #7 on twitch’s most popular games.

&#x200B;

Some google trends:

&#x200B;

**Other competitors:**

Taketwo has beaten earnings estimates for the last 3 quarters in a row. Their projected Q1 EPS is 0.56. EA and Activision both also beat earnings this quarter and we’re all aware of why: everyone is at home and bored out of their mind. Gaming is one of the few things that there is to do. Microsoft’s CEO stated recently that Xbox live use was almost at an all-time high. Furthermore, Ttwo isn’t as reliant as EA or Activision for yearly releases. I touched on this before, but GTA online, Red Dead online, and NBA 2k online generate tons of revenue for Taketwo in the form of microtransactions. NBA 2k online will be livestreamed on ESPN2, for example and it has 50 million users in China alone. GTA online has shown increasing revenue growth. 2019 Q4 has an increase of 54% in revenue from recurrent purchasers.

&#x200B;

**Financials:**

No long-term debt. Assets, revenues, and net income have been going up. They’ve continued to repurchase their stock.

&#x200B;

**However...** they're already at their ATH and they haven't had any big blockbuster release this quarter. Activation had COD drop meanwhile EA had nothing major. The big difference may just be revenue from microtransaction but I'm too stupid to figure out how to calculate that. IV is also fairly high right now for their options.

Thinking of dropping VOO and MA and putting 2k into BA and 2k into AAPL then 1k into TTWO 1k into SHOP or FB haven't decided yet. But then comes the question of LMT, BRK.B and NVDA. I thought about NVDA but it seems incredibly high right now and earnings come out this Thursday so I'm incredibly iffy about that.

# Description
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is a developer, publisher and marketer of entertainment for consumers around the world. Through its labels, Rockstar Games and 2K, its range of genres includes action, adventure, family/casual, racing, role-playing, shooter, sports and strategy, which it distributes across the world. It owns franchises like Grand Theft Auto, L.A. Noire, Max Payne, Midnight Club and Red Dead. 

## Recent financials 

When I look at the figures I have to say I get scared. Both the top and bottom line are crazy variable.

|March year-end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1.4bn | $1.1bn | $2.4bn | $1.2bn | $0.8bn|
|EPS | -$0.10 | -$3.48 | $3.20 | -$0.34 | -$1.31|

Looking at the recent year, 53% of sales were in the US and 83% were on Consoles. Those trends were pretty stable. Though one trend worth highlighting is that digital sales were 49% of sales (v retailers) last year, compared with just 16% 24 months earlier.

Though the future must be bright, as the expectation is for sales of $1.7bn in the year to March 2017 and a healthy $1.72 a share in earnings. 

## Competition

When it comes to describing the competitive environment

> Competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation, features, playability, and product quality; brand name recognition; compatibility with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; price; marketing; and customer service. Our business is driven by hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing. Competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sell-through of our titles at retail stores.

With Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Sony and Electronic Arts all getting mention. Though they do go on to point out that they face competition for time / money from other forms of entertainment: 

> motion pictures, television and audio, social networking, online computer programs, and mobile games 

To boot, I add in Mattel and Hasbro given *toys* are an adjacent category.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. | $1,523M | 14% | N/A
Electronic Arts Inc. | $4,547M | 27% | 37%
Activision Blizzard, Inc. | $5,946M | 32% | 10%
Ubisoft Entertainment SA | €1,394M | 43% | 9%
Hasbro, Inc. | $4,855M | 19% | 33%
Mattel, Inc. | $5,622M | 15% | 14%
Sony Corp (ADR) | $67,713M | 9% | 6%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,394M | 32% | 22%

With all that in mind, TTWO is clearly at the bottom of the class :( 

## Cash / Debt?

TTWO has $663M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 16% of the market value. So nothing to worry about there. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $53.49 for TTWO and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

But with all that in mind why on earth do I want to pay 28x earnings for this stock when everyone else is at 18 to 23x. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ttwo.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
TTWO.O | $4,190M | 28x | 12% | 0% | 4%
EA.O | $23,371M | 21x | 15% | 0% | 6%
ATVI.O | $27,112M | 18x | 25% | 1% | 7%
UBIP.PA | €3,527M | 23x | 38% | 0% | 15%
HAS.O | $10,530M | 20x | 11% | 2% | 9%
MAT.O | $10,196M | 23x | 10% | 5% | 11%
SNE | $35,157M | 43x | 24% | 1% | 16%
MSFT.O | $468,232M | 20x | 10% | 3% | 7%

Is there some magic coming on the margin front? Or a major hit about to land in their lap?

# Dividends

TTWO is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Worse still

> We have never declared or paid cash dividends. We currently anticipate that all future earnings will be retained to finance the growth of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 24% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 29%. Wow. So it's really grown into that valuation. That's against  a backdrop of sales up 18% in the 6 months to Sept.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they said:

> The potential for our industry has never been stronger and Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity strategically, creatively and financially, and to deliver returns for our shareholders over the long-term.

Which is punchy stuff. 

To me the volatility in sales and profits doesn't merit a premium, quite the opposite. And compared with EA or Activision, it's clearly subscale. Sure there maybe some hits coming, but like the movie industry or investing... isn't it sensible to diversify?

1p4gfc_TTWO,TTWO,I think TTWO is finally ready for a big rally,"So I've been following/buying into Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) for several months now.

This came in way above most estimates (1 billion before Dec 31) and therefore I believe will lead to a positive surprise on the 29th. Additionally I think that a fair value of take-two is in the range of +15 P/E. This is estimate is based on the companies previous valuation and the valuation of other companies in the industry. With 15 times earning in mind, the consensus for the Quarterly report is appx $1.50. This leads to a justifiable price target of $22.50 at current estimates, not even including what I am anticipating to be a positive surprise. currently trading at $17.10 a share that's a 30% upside in the near term.

1ml1p7_TTWO,TTWO,Why I decided to invest into TTWO (GTA V),"Lets take a look at TTWO Interactive. The statistics do not look that great:

* Current price upon purchase 16.65
* 1.57B Market Cap
* 52 week highs and lows are 10.01 to 19.25
* P/E Ratio 1,284.30
* EPS 0.01

Right now GTA V is only released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 consoles. PC release has not been announced. Global sales for each console is about 70 million, which means there are 140 million consoles that can run GTA V. According to this [site](http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto), GTA IV had sales of 25 million. I predict GTA V will sell over 25 million and there will be a future of having possibilities of DLC content and etc. Assuming that GTA V will sell 25 million copies, that is equal to 1.5 billion. In income will probably be more than half of that, which makes me to believe that TTWO is underpriced right now.
