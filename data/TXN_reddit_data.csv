Texas Instruments Inc. shares rose in the extended session Tuesday after the chip maker reported a big earnings beat for the quarter and an outlook that was mostly above Wall Street estimates.

Texas Instruments [**TXN,** **-1.45%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TXN?mod=MW_story_quote) shares rose 4% in after-hours trading, following a 1.5% decline in the regular session to close at $160.84.

For the second quarter, Texas Instruments posted net income of $2.29 billion, or $2.45 a share, compared with $1.93 billion, or $2.05 a share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue rose to $5.21 billion from $4.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, the company said.

Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.13 a share on revenue of $4.65 billion, based on the company’s outlook of $1.84 to $2.26 a share on revenue of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion.

 TI was one of the first chip companies last earnings season that had [warned the COVID-lockdowns in China would likely hit many of its customers](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/texas-instruments-stock-drops-more-than-5-as-china-covid-restrictions-blamed-for-light-outlook-11651004172), and issued a cautious outlook. It was the only major chip maker tha[t saw its Wall Street consensus estimate rise over the quarter](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/are-chip-stocks-set-up-for-a-short-squeeze-or-just-more-declines-wall-street-doesnt-seem-sure-11657735881). 

Sales of analog electronics, which convert real-world data such as sound or temperature into digital data, rose 15% to $3.99 billion from the year-ago period, while analysts had forecast $3.66 billion. Sales of embedded processors, which take that digital data and use it to perform specific tasks, rose 5% to $821 million, with analysts expecting $740 million.

For the third quarter, the company expects earnings of $2.23 to $2.51 a share on revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, while analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, had forecast earnings of $2.26 a share on revenue of $4.98 billion.

TI’s stock has also performed better — meaning, hasn’t dropped as much — than other chip-related companies in 2022. As the largest U.S. supplier of chips to the auto industry, TI said[ back in January](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/texas-instruments-stock-rallies-as-quarter-outlook-top-expectations-11643144999) it was placing added emphasis on auto and industrial customers, which were the hardest hit by COVID-triggered shortages.",2022-07-26,79,14

i2glxb_TXN,TXN,Trade Idea of the Week - 8/3/2020 - TXN,"Probably an embarrassing thing to admit, but I \*do\* have memories of a calculator when I was growing up.  In high school, we needed to have a graphing calculator and it wasn't long before we realized we could load (basic) games on it and waste time rather than paying attention in class.  The calculator of choice, of course, was by Texas Instruments (Ticker: TXN). My first was a hand-me-down TI-82, and I later upgraded to the luxurious (in those days) TI-89 when I went off to college.  It played even better games ...

While I associate Texas Instruments with their calculators, that portion of their business is relatively small - buried in their ""Other"" product categories.  TXN is a semiconductor design and manufacturing company.  Semiconductors accounted for about 69% of their profit in 2019, embedded processors about 22% and ""other"" about 9%.  

This week, we look at a bullish play in TXN:

&#x200B;

[6 Month Chart of TXN](https://preview.redd.it/nojewtfknme51.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8838c9965873f9e8d7fe9d89c276d5f45788ae5)

* Want shares for the long term? Sell a cash secured put: August 21st 120 put for 1.22 
* Want a trade? Sell a put spread: Sell the August 21st 120 put and buy the 115 call for 0.60 net credit 
* Prices are at the midpoint as of 7/31/2020
* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.

Wall Street expected 0.88 in earnings recently and TXN came in at 1.48.  TXN then sold off...  A reminder that post earnings performance is never 'obvious'!  With TXN down, one can sell a put and take ownership of shares ""on sale"" if it continues to fall for the next three weeks.  

TXN pays a solid dividend of $3.60 on an annual basis, up from 1.40 in 2015.  I expect it will continue to increase over time.  If we are assigned at 120, we'll receive a 3% yield on our shares.  This coupled with selling covered calls on the position could net a nice return while waiting for the shares to rebound.

If we aren't assigned, we'll receive a bit over a 1% return on our risk (1.22/118.78).  Total risk is defined as TXN going bankrupt and its shares becoming worthless ($0). With portfolio margin, there is a buying power impact of about $1115.  

For the put spreads, we are risking $440 to make $60.  If it expires worthless our return on risk will therefore be 13.6%.  

**Why else do we like this trade?**

IV has come down since earnings, but it has remained well above historical volatility.  If you review IV and HV for even longer, you'll see that the IV is actually near the pre-COVID high end of the range as well.

Earnings are behind us and the dividend was just paid, so there are no near term events in the underlying.

**What can go wrong?**

The market or the stock could tank.  The stock is pricing in a $6.88 move by expiration, which if it is to the downside, would be Above our short strike.  Still, this is an Estimate and the stock could drop much more.  We'll lose money below 118.78 at expiration for the short put or below 119.40 on the put spread.

The market overall could drop due to COVID-19 or one of many other macro events.  As always, we place trades within our risk guidelines knowing that almost anything can happen.

**Side note -** 

I realize this trade idea is a bit similar to last week's although very different names and some different reasoning (Side Side note - last week's trade can already be closed for half the profit) .  I like the vol profile more on this and while I don't share all my trades, this one offered some additional concepts.

Previously, I'd give you some bullshit and call you all faggots, but it's time we make this sub great again. Disclaimer: I'm not an electrical engineering and I probably don't know what I'm talking about. Please feel free to correct me.

# What does Texas Instruments do?
Texas Instruments is in the semiconductor industry. They revolve around designing analog semiconductors (~80% revenue) and embedded processors (~20%). I don't know enough about these two things, so you'll have to go find an EE to explain these two to you.

# What Industries does TI sell to?
* Automotive (15% of revenue) - Infotainment, safety software, and all the stuff you don't have because you bought the base model you broke ass bitch.

* Industrial (30% of revenue) - Factory automation, medical devices, appliances, etc

* Personal Electronics (30% of revenue) - Phones, computers, that electric toothbrush your wife uses to pleasure herself because you can't.

* Other - Enterprise systems, communication equipment, calculators, and stuff

# How are these industries currently doing?

ETFs do a great job telling us how an industry is doing. Be sure to pay attention to how the general market is doing before going into your earnings play.

* Automotive ($CARZ) - **Bearish.** Their 2015 Q4 claimed that the strong auto industry significantly boosted their revenue, which makes sense because 2015 was a great year for car sales (with the low oil prices). However, notice how $CARZ has been in decline since 2015. There will likely be zero growth in this industry (and even more likely a decline).

* Industrial (Automation, Healthcare) - **Uncertain, leaning bearish.** TI definitely generates significant income from Factory Automation. We can track how well that industry is doing with $XLI. It seems like the manufacturing industry has stayed relatively flat except for that spike in July post-Brexit that was caused solely because of FSComeau. Regardless, this earnings report will not account for that spike. However, the Healthcare Technology, $IHI (**Bullish**), industry seems to be doing very well. Medical devices also usually use analog chips because they need to record real measurements (I'm not explaining analog vs digital to you mouthbreathers). **If there's any growth from TI, it will be in this sector.**

* Personal electronics - **Bearish.** I have no idea what TI does for smartphones and laptops/tablets - if someone can explain this that would be great. Regardless, smartphone sales have declined for the first time ever. As for laptops, I did some spot checking on companies such as Lenovo, Apple, HP, Asus, etc; they're all doing very poor.

# What is the general consensus of TI?

Texas instruments is up ~20% YTD for whatever reason. There was a small market correction of -2% the day after after Q2 earnings (-5% week after). The growth that they're seeing is absolutely absurd, and they should be in for another market correction this earnings. Their growth is already priced into the stock; which means that any indication that TI isn't going to continue to grow at 20% will cause a drop in price - even if they beat earnings. **I will be opening a short position when market opens tomorrow. http://imgur.com/eb7PI76.**

# Insider Trading
I don't open a position based of insider trading alone, but I definitely look at it to confirm my decision. More shares have been sold this quarter than have been sold in the entire year. 

# TL;DR. 

I've kept this post relatively PG-13, which means I can still drop the F word once. **Go Fuck Yourself and open a short position tomorrow.** 


TI is a great long term investment, the microprocessors they create is used in literally everything. But there's no reason why they should be seeing this kind of growth.
