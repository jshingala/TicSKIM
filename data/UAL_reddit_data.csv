>United Airlines maintained its full-year forecast on Tuesday but took an unusual step of offering a second forecast should the U.S. slip into a recession, calling the economy “impossible to predict.” Either way, it expects to turn a profit.

>The carrier warned alongside its first-quarter earnings that a recession could drive down profits this year, but said booking trends are stable.
>
>The company left in place expectations issued in January for adjusted earnings per share of $11.50 to $13.50, but said that in a recession, it would expect to earn between $7 per share and $9 per share on an adjusted basis.
>
>“The Company’s outlook is dependent on the macro environment which the Company believes is impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence,” it said in a securities filing.
>
>United Airlines said Tuesday that it plans to cut flights starting this summer to match disappointing domestic travel demand while bookings for pricier, international trips remain strong.

1jr2nf6_PATH,PATH,UAL poor man's covered put - short put went in the money,"Need some help with strategy.   
  
Bought UAL 85 put expiring July 18 for $1490.  
It moved a bit in my direction, so I sold short 62 put expiring April 17. $160 premium collected.   
  
United had a microwave in the galley catch fire, in addition to the broad market dumpster fire, UAL stock down 15% today. Short put goes in the money. Sold a short call against the short put to lower my cost basis another .97, which lost half it's value by market close as UAL kept dropping.   
  
The short put is now slightly ITM on an aftermarket bounce, but above my breakeven. 

Here are my choices as I see it. 

1) Close out all the trades. Take the profit on the long put and the short call. (about $1130) Eat the $376 loss on the short put. Be happy. 

2) Do nothing. Hold through April expiry, hope the short put goes out of the money. If UAL drops more and short put stays ITM, just treat it as a CSP, but I've still got that long put with .83 delta giving me downside protection. Wheel it until I get back to breakeven. 

3) Roll the short put out, maybe down to avoid assignment in April? 

Other ideas?

1g63pzy_UAL,UAL,ELI5: UAL stock buyback edition,"First off, congrats to anyone else who bought UAL during the pandemic.

Ever since their announcement a few days ago, I've been hearing a lot of talk about their stock buyback. Some good, some bad.

I have a very basic understanding of stock buybacks (as in I watched 2 YouTube videos on it this morning), so I don't quite understand what this means for UAL. Can someone explain?

Bonus question: How should this affect when I sell UAL?",2024-10-17,9,8
1g52gmp_UAL,UAL,"United Airlines plans $1.5 billion share buyback, beats estimates for Q3","United Airlines said Tuesday that it is starting a $1.5 billion share buyback as the carrier reported higher-than-expected earnings for the busy summer travel season and forecast strong results for the last three months of the year.

Shares of the airline were up roughly 9% in morning trading Wednesday, heading for their highest close since February 2020, before Covid-19 was declared a pandemic.

United expects to earn an adjusted $2.50 to $3.00 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.00 a share a year earlier and the $2.68 analysts polled by LSEG estimated.

Here is what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.33 adjusted vs. $3.17 expected

Revenue: $14.84 billion vs. $14.78 billion expected

The share buyback would be United’s first since before the Covid-19 pandemic. U.S. airlines received more than $50 billion in government aid during the pandemic travel slump that prohibited share repurchases and dividends, though airlines were still fighting for financial stability.

Southwest Airlines announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program last month.

“Like other leading airlines and companies, we are initiating a measured, strategic share repurchase program,” United CEO Scott Kirby said in a note to staff on Tuesday. “Importantly, my commitment to you is that investing in our people and our business will always be my top priority even while we institute this share repurchase program.”

For the third quarter, United posted revenue of $14.84 billion, up 2.5% from a year earlier and above analysts’ estimates. It reported net income of $965 million, down 15% from a year ago.

United said domestic unit revenue was positive in August and September compared to last year as airlines trimmed a glut of flights that were pushing down fares. United expanded capacity by 4.1% in the third quarter. The carrier said corporate revenue rose 13% in the quarter; premium revenue, including business class tickets, rose 5%; and sales from its no-frills basic economy tickets were up 20%.

The airline last week unveiled a far-flung expansion for next year that included new flights to Mongolia, Senegal, Spain and Greenland in a chase for international travel demand.

Adjusting for one-time items, United reported earnings per share of $3.33, topping Wall Street forecasts and United’s estimate in July of $2.75 to $3.25 a share.

Airline executives will hold a call with analysts at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday and will likely face questions about demand for the end of the year and into 2025, as well as production problems at Boeing, where most factories have been idled during a more than monthlong machinist strike.

United’s flight attendants’ union, which hasn’t yet reached a new labor agreement with the company slammed the airline’s decision to resume buybacks.

In a statement, Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents crews at United, Spirit, Alaska and other carriers, said: “That money United just promised Wall Street belongs to Flight Attendants who worked throughout the pandemic and during this taxing recovery for all of us on the frontlines.”

1e5xo5k_UAL,UAL,"United Airlines profit jumps 23%, but third-quarter forecast disappoints ","United Airlines’ second-quarter profit rose more than 20% from last year as strong demand for international travel boosted the carrier’s results, but its third-quarter forecast came in shy of estimates as an oversupply of flights weighs on fares.

United said Wednesday that it expects to earn between $2.75 and $3.25 a share on an adjusted basis in the current quarter, lower than the $3.44 a share analysts polled by LSEG estimated.

Here’s what United reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $4.14 adjusted vs. $3.93 expected

Revenue: $14.99 billion vs. $15.06 billion expected

United earned $1.32 billion, or $3.96 per share, in the three months ended June 30, up from $1.08 billion, or $3.24 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, it reported earnings of $4.14 a share, compared with $3.93 that analysts expected.

Revenue of $14.99 billion jumped 5.7% from the year-earlier period, though it was just shy of estimates.

United reiterated its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings of $9 to $11 a share.

United and Delta Air Lines, which also disappointed with its third-quarter guidance, have still been standouts in the U.S. airline industry. Most carriers have been struggling with an increase in domestic capacity that has weighed on airfares, despite record demand.

Both carriers have added international flights, which have been in high demand after the pandemic, and premium offerings, like bigger lounges and more spacious seats, capitalizing on travelers willing to pay more for a ticket.

United said on Wednesday that premium revenue grew more than 8% from last year, while sales from the most restrictive basic economy tickets rose 38%, as it works to cater to both ends of the market.

The company expanded domestic flying by more than 5% in the second quarter over last year, and unit revenues fell more than 1% over last year. Yields on flights to and from Europe, which is a smaller slice of United’s sales, rose more than 5%, compared with the second quarter of 2023.

United CEO Scott Kirby said airlines have been trimming their schedules and that there will be an inflection point to moderate the supply in mid-August.

“Looking forward, we see multiple airlines have begun to cancel loss-making capacity, and we expect leading unit revenue performance among our largest peers in the second half of the third quarter,” he said.

On Tuesday, Spirit Airlines cut its second-quarter forecast, citing weaker-than-expected revenue for fees like seating or luggage. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, which report results on July 25, previously reduced their second-quarter estimates.

1bmcxfu_F,F,United Airlines Faces Closer F.A.A. Scrutiny After Safety Incidents,"The Federal Aviation Administration will scrutinize United Airlines’ operations more closely in coming weeks after a spate of recent safety incidents, the airline told employees in a memo on Friday.  
“We will begin to see more of an F.A.A. presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities,” Sasha Johnson, a vice president of corporate safety at the airline, said in the memo. “We welcome their engagement and are very open to hear from them about what they find and their perspective on things we may need to change to make us even safer.""  
In some of the incidents, which United has said were unrelated, a plane veered off a runway, another arrived at its destination with a panel missing from its body, another lost a tire after takeoff and an engine caught fire after ingesting plastic wrapping.  
The F.A.A. said in a statement on Friday that it “routinely” monitored airline operations. The agency said it “focuses on an airline’s compliance with applicable regulations; ability to identify hazards, assess and mitigate risk; and effectively manage safety.”  
In the United memo, Ms. Johnson said the agency would “also pause a variety of certification activities for a period of time.” The F.A.A. said in a statement on Saturday that certification processes already underway might be allowed to continue, but that future ones could be delayed, depending on what it found. The agency oversees and approves a wide range of airline activities, such as pilot training or new flight routes.

""The higher fuel will more than wipe out better revenue near-term resulting in modest reductions to 1Q22 estimates,"" warned MKM Partners analyst Conor Cunningham on the development.

United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) owns its own refinery as opposed to some peers that hedge or just buy jet fuel at spot prices. Analysts have also warned that European travel demand could be lower in the summer due to macro factors and the war headlines, which would impact UAL.

Shares of United Airlines Holdings (UAL) hit a new 52-week low of $30.87 on Monday as the Ukraine-Russia headlines and the prospect for higher jet fuel prices continued to power down expectations for a full post-pandemic recovery in the summer of 2022.

United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) may need to consider potential equity raises to provide further liquidity cushion with oil trading over $100, according to Wolfe Research.

Wolfe is now forecasting ""even bigger"" EPS losses and cash burn for UAL and AAL this year with UAL burning $5.9B of cash and AAL burning $4.4B, Wolfe analyst Scott Group wrote in a note earlier.

Southwest Flight 1380

\- Tuesday mid-day April 17 2018

\- 8 injuries 1 death

\- -4% mid day dip and full recovery by EOD

American Airlines Flight 383

\- Friday after-hours Oct 28 2016

\- 21 injuries 0 deaths

\- Literally nothing, opened .7% lower on Monday and closed .6% higher than Friday's close

Delta Flight 89

\- Tuesday mid-day Jan 14 2020

\- 0 injuries 0 deaths

\- -2% mid day dip, EOD recovery to -1%. Full recovery by Wednesday close/Thursday open

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

Southwest's dip can be attributed to the death during trading hours and American Airline's to the 21 injuries. In both instances, recoveries occurred almost immediately.

hgjzo6_UAL,UAL,Does recent PR indicate airlines are drowning? I think yes (UAL and AAL in particular),"Airlines have already been devastated but lately amidst the worsening rout, we have seen these bizarre PR headlines that seem focused on driving up the stock price without grounding in reality. 

Today we see UAL is resuming flights to China. Wow. Woot. Except only Chinese citizens can return to China. So WTF is the revenue coming from and are these flights actually just going to be burning more money being in the air mostly empty? (the answer is yes)

Next we have AAL. ""We are allowing people to sit in the middle seat again"". So in the midst of the pandemic re-worsening in the US, you are telling me enough people are flying AAL to where they A) actually have to re-open their seats and B) are willing to sit shoulder to shoulder if that is the case, packed like sardines in coach, when destinations are once again implementing travel restrictions (not to mention international travel is impossible almost anywhere), and when unemployment / disposable income are about to be at their highest and lowest respective levels in a loooooong time? And it isn't like there are any conventions or business travel happening anymore....

My point is these headlines are fluff designed to distract from their massive debt offerings and prospective dilutions of shareholders. Q2 results are impending and are going to be.... so very bad. Early indications are that Q3 really may not be much better (OK, 10-20% above worst-ever levels is an improvement but if you are still bleeding 40-50M a day....). 

These last-ditch PR blitzes are designed to bolster the debt offerings but IMO both UAL and AAL are ultimately going to be bailed out by the govt and shareholder equity is going to be wiped out entirely, this may actually become evident in the share price of both airlines as early as August or September (remember, markets are forward looking).",2020-06-27,5,9

Positions: 27.5P 6/19 yesterday,  if market rallies tomorrow will buy 7/17 $25P

&#x200B;

1. Airlines take full deposits upfront and UAL did not start giving refunds on international travel until this week. That means that they have HUGE amounts of cash on their balance sheet that is about to be returned to customers given that they finally had to start refunding as of this week (or the DOT was going to sue them). They have officially been refunding in DROVES meaning their balance sheet for Q2 could be worse than DAL, LUV, and AAL who were refunding prior.
2. Airlines derive their revenue by something called yield. This represents the amount of money brought in from an individual flights. The majority of this comes from the folks upfront: high net worth individuals and corporations; furthermore, the majority of profit comes from these people flying internationally. High net worth people have rented homes in Hamptons, Aspen etc and are not going on planes unless necessary (or they're flying private) and corporations won't be traveling in large numbers until mid-2021. At this point, I posit that yield is at AN ALL TIME LOW. Yield is not derived from 14% of travelers who decide to spontaneously go to LA for a $439 fare from New York in lie flat business, it's derived from the executive who needs to go to LA for an hour long meeting and spends $4300 on that same seat or the heiress who buys two of them (one for her dog).

tldr: airlines had cash they need to return to consumers on their balance sheet as of Q1. think about how airlines make profit (expensive tickets which are not being sold) and consider when they will make money again (especially given that they have new debt servicing, even at free interest rates, that does not mean free on a balance sheet)",2020-06-11,39,35

While we will likely have to endure social distancing for months to come, there are signs that air travel may pick back up in the next 6 months or so:

* Several US states are considering loosening travel restrictions over the next few weeks ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/coronavirus-tracker-live.html)).
* Schools are reopening in China, Japan, Germany, and others ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/coronavirus-countries-schools-education-covid19-reopen-classroom/)).

With that said, I believe airlines will bounce by December 2020. I'd like to get feedback on my strategy.

# Strategy

I purchased strikes for DEC 20 around $10-$15 above the current value. I think the prices will bounce before that date. I intend to take advantage of that by selling before the expiration date while IV is high and the options still have extrinsic value.

DAL 35C (Dec 20)

UAL 38C (Dec 20)

# Exit Strategy

Sell after 50% loss OR after 200-300% profit.

My game plan was to sell to close right before UAL released earnings to cash in on the recent volatility. I looked up when UAL earnings would be released and saw the call was scheduled for 10 AM this Friday (and I made the naive assumption that was when the earnings report would be released but did think it was odd they would release earnings during trading hours....).

Anyways, I have this belief (rationale or not) that Thursday evenings bring good coronavirus news, so I figured I would roll the dice and just sell to close at open on Friday before the earnings call, and with a little luck, after some good news.

Little did I realize the earnings report was dropped after close today (Thursday)... the report indicated losses were not ""as bad as expected"".

My question is, is there still any point in selling before the earnings call to cash in on some of the volatility or should I just hold till next week when a few more states open up and hopefully UAL will go up, up, up.
