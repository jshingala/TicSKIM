1kxtffr_UNH,UNH,UNH LEAP spread looks good,"This leap spread looks pretty good. It has positive theta and I have a whole year. The stock is trading at multi year lows. New CEO has brought a good chunk and is at 12 PE. I feel 350 to 400 looks very attainable given the company's strong moat and established presence. 

What are your thoughts? How can this go wrong.

1kxlddq_UNH,UNH,Is  UNH the most underrated AI stock in a $5T industry?,"Everyone's talking about AI in tech, but UnitedHealth is quietly promoting AI in America's most disruptive industry, healthcare



They're not just experimenting, either. They've got AI handling customer service, helping people find doctors, speeding up insurance claims, and streamlining common medical red tape. They're even training their own employees and building their own models based on their private data (which is a huge advantage in healthcare)



To be fair, they've had a rough year: their CEO resigned, previous CEO was murdered (yeah, that happened), they missed earnings, and they Also a class action lawsuit claiming AI was used to deny claims (which they deny - say it's always human-reviewed). say it's always human-reviewed if flagged)

It feels like a traditional giant is slowly transforming into a technology-first healthcare platform. It could be nothing ...... Or it could be the start of something big

1kudplb_NET,NET,"UNH Valuation Analysis: DCF, P/E, Analyst Ratings, Market Fluctuations","I took a bit of time to ask chatGPT some questions related to UNH’s valuation. Specifically asked it to rely on the most recent earnings report, analyst ratings from the last 15 days, and I also asked it to provide three different scenarios where the overall market rose 10%, stayed flat, and fell 10%. Take this with a grain of salt (good starting point analysis), do your own research as there are many factors to an investment, and let me know your thoughts on this company’s valuation and how to improve the analysis. Btw this is not investment advice, just a fun way to look at valuing companies. 

""Here’s a full **comprehensive summary** of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) valuation as of May 24, 2025, combining:

* **P/E-based valuation using the most recent EPS estimates and analyst ratings**
* **DCF valuation with scenario analysis**
* **Market-based performance scenarios**

# I. P/E-Based Valuation (using recent analyst EPS estimates and ratings)

# Latest EPS (2025 Guidance):

* From Q1 2025 press release: **$26.00 – $26.50** → Midpoint = **$26.25**

# Recent Analyst P/E Implied Valuations (from last 15 days):

|Analyst|Price Target|Implied P/E (on EPS 26.25)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|RBC Capital|$525|20.0|
|KeyCorp|$575|21.9|
|Jefferies|$530|20.2|

# Fair Value Range (using $26.25 EPS):

* **At P/E 15 (risk-adjusted):** 26.25 × 15 = **$393.75**
* **At P/E 17:** 26.25 × 17 = **$446.25**
* **At P/E 20–22 (analyst targets):** $525–$575

# II. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

|Scenario|Growth|EBIT Margin|WACC|Terminal Growth|Fair Value / Share|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bear Case|3.5%|6.0%|9%|2.0%|\~$290|
|Base Case|5.0%|6.5%|8%|2.5%|\~$364|
|Bull Case|6.5%|7.0%|7.5%|3.0%|\~$440|

* **Terminal value & discounted cash flows** were computed using conservative assumptions based on Q1 2025 press release and public financial data.
* **Net debt**: \~ $40B | **Shares outstanding**: \~950M

# III. Market-Based Scenarios (Next 12 Months)

|Market Outcome|Impact on UNH Multiple|Expected Value (12-mo)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**S&P +10%** (Bull)|P/E expands to 18–19|**$430–$450**|Sentiment lift, higher P/E|
|**S&P flat**|P/E holds at \~16–17|**$360–$375**|Matches base DCF|
|**S&P –10%** (Bear)|P/E compresses to \~14|**$290–$310**|Defensive stock, but risk still priced in|

# IV. Final Valuation Summary

|Method|Estimated Fair Value|
|:-|:-|
|**P/E (conservative)**|$394 – $446|
|**P/E (analyst targets)**|$525 – $575|
|**DCF (base case)**|\~$364|
|**Scenario (bear to bull)**|$290 – $440|

# 

# Conclusion:

* UNH appears undervalued in both DCF and P/E frameworks, especially relative to historical and analyst-based multiples.
* Risks (regulatory scrutiny, brand negativity, medical cost inflation) are real but may already be priced in at this level.
* If sentiment improves or risks normalize, upside potential is significant, especially toward the $400–$450 range.

# Margin of Safety

Intrinsic Value Estimate Range:

* Base Case: \~$360–$375
* Aggressive Upside (Bull Case): \~$440–$450
* Bear Case (Downside Fair Value): \~$290

Current Market Price (May 24, 2025):  
$295.57

Margin of Safety Calculation:

* Base Case Margin of Safety:
   * (365 – 295.57) / 365 = \~19% → This indicates a 19% margin of safety in the base case.
* Bear Case Margin of Safety:
   * (290 – 295.57) / 290 = \~–1.9% → No cushion if the worst-case scenario materializes.
* Bull Case Margin of Safety:
   * (445 – 295.57) / 445 = \~33.6% → Strong upside potential, with a 33.6% margin of safety if the stock re-rates toward the bull case.

# Final Thoughts on Margin of Safety:

* Base case margin of safety: \~19%
* Bull case margin of safety: \~33.6%
* Bear case margin of safety: minimal or negative

Given the defensive qualities and long-term growth potential of UNH, 19% to 33.6% margin of safety offers a reasonable cushion against downside risk in a moderate-to-bullish market scenario.""

  
While I expect a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the next \~6 months with UNH stock, I do think the current price could present a buying opportunity to those with a long enough time horizon and stomach for short term risk. As value investors, we look for opportunities where a stock may have poor short term sentiment (and a substantial share price haircut), but good longer term potential. I think UNH may fit that criteria. The management team now sees the old CEO returning and purchasing $25m of shares, which is encouraging. The DOJ court case does still worry me, and there are headwinds in the short term with tariffs and other factors to consider. Let me know your thoughts on the valuation and how you might improve it or if you have your own valuation to share.

**Summary**

In the past week, six companies adjusted their 2025 financial guidance: four raised forecasts, one suspended outlook, and another lowered. Amer Sports (AS) led the upward revisions, increasing revenue growth guidance to 15%-17% from 13%-15% after a 23% surge in Q1 sales. Birkenstock (BIRK) also raised its adjusted EBITDA target to €660–670 million, reflecting strong demand. Conversely, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) suspended its 2025 outlook amid rising medical costs and leadership changes, while Flowers Foods (FLO) lowered net sales guidance by 3.8% to 5.7% due to tariff concerns and weakened consumer spending.

Ryals McMullian, Flowers Foods CEO, commented on the lowered FY25 guidance and near-term actions: ""Our adjusted 2025 financial guidance reflects our first quarter performance, the challenging consumer environment, and potential for increased tariff costs. To improve our near-term results, we are gaining additional shelf space, winning new business, and taking other proactive measures...""

I had some July 400 calls briefly but swapped them for June 360s because I think this is gonna run for the next 1-2 weeks at least based on the strong price action.

Operating profit of approximately $9.119 billion and a consolidated operating margin of 8.3% (7.9% for the same period in 2024) show a slight improvement in profitability over last year.

Cash Flow and Debt: Q1 2025 operating cash flow was $5.456 billion, and the company returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends during the same period. As of March 31, 2025, long-term debt was approximately $71.285 billion, down slightly from $72.359 billion in the same period last year, keeping the debt burden at a manageable level

Outlook: The Company lowered its 2025 EPS guidance to $24.65-25.15 (GAAP) from $29.50-30.00 (adjusted target of $26.00-26.50) to reflect the impact of demand overruns in the Medicare Advantage business demand exceeding expectations and the impact of changes in Optum Health's membership mix. Management has indicated that it has taken steps to address these cost increases and is striving to return to higher growth rates during the year.

Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly:,"Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).

My new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH

I have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.

In no particular order:

1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:

• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.

• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290

• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648

• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.

“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger

No better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.

2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)

3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn 

Furthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.

4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:

- Covers 50 million people
- $410B in annual revenues 
- 400,000 employees
- 90,000 doctors in the network

Said differently:  Too Big To Fail.

5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.

6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.

7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.

I have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.

In no particular order:

1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:

• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.

• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290

• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648

• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.

What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.

1kpj5a3_NET,NET,Unusual Activity: UNH Insiders and Options Traders Signal Reversal,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has been in freefall, the stock is down nearly 50% in just one month, an unusual move for a blue-chip healthcare company. At current levels, it’s now trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 12, a valuation historically reserved for companies facing serious structural headwinds.

But here’s the catch: UnitedHealth isn’t showing signs of a broken business. Revenue is still strong. Fundamentals haven’t collapsed. Which raises the question -how much further can it realistically fall?

This may be exactly why insiders have begun to load the boat.



**Net Options Sentiment: A Bullish Inflection Point**



https://preview.redd.it/2b1vfojjdj1f1.jpg?width=1063&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58debe9988312c69534c14ae54036a319ba6ceca

Chart - [Prospero.AI](http://Prospero.AI)

What we’re seeing in the chart above is a surge in Net Options Sentiment, a proxy for aggregated insider behavior in the options market. The purple line, representing net bullish vs bearish options activity, has spiked sharply in the last few days, reaching some of the highest levels year-to-date.

This bullish surge comes right as the stock price (pink line) appears to be bottoming around $250–280. That divergence, falling price with rising insider sentiment, could be a setup for mean reversion.

This isn’t just passive buying. The velocity of the sentiment reversal indicates aggressive positioning, likely from those with deeper insight into the company’s risk exposure and forward-looking fundamentals.





**Insider Buying Hits a Rare Crescendo**



May 15th marked a massive cluster buy event from top executives:



https://preview.redd.it/3t3xgyhndj1f1.png?width=1776&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f099bf095d89e71eb33f9fe1d810cad7777a6a4

This is the first coordinated insider buying in over a year, and they’re not nibbling. These are eight-figure trades from the C-suite, especially from Hemsley and Rex, who are buying near multi-year lows.



https://preview.redd.it/pizz6qoodj1f1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b61ef05e55b2b949fb1f6d31281bd2c03674e8c

Zooming out, insider activity at UNH has historically been sparse and muted. The last time we saw any insider purchases was back in January 2025, and before that, there had been no buying for over a year. This sudden surge is meaningful, and potentially signaling that the worst may be priced in.



**Long-Term Opportunity?**

UNH’s valuation, insider activity, and options sentiment all paint a compelling picture. While near-term volatility might persist, the risk/reward for long-term investors looks increasingly attractive. Insiders appear confident that the fundamentals are intact and that current fears, whether regulatory or earnings-based, are overblown. If insiders are right and their conviction suggests they believe the storm is temporary, this could be one of the better long-horizon buys in the healthcare sector right now.",2025-05-18,161,68

1kpkwod_UNH,UNH,UNH vs DOJ and the factors surrounding the Judge's future decision,"As many have been discussing recently, the DOJ vs United Healthcare trial has had significant sway on the stock, and reports of a potential criminal investigation related to alleged fraud have likewise drawn interest from the public and from folks here on reddit. I wanted to find out more about the Judge, the probability for a dismissal or reduction in scope of civil/fraud cases based upon the Special Master's dismissal recommendation, and other similar cases of fraud against healthcare companies. I used chatGPT for this research (in quotation marks below).

# ""Case Overview:

* **Parties:** DOJ vs. UnitedHealth Group.
* **Allegations:** UNH allegedly inflated Medicare Advantage payments by submitting unsupported diagnosis codes.
* **Case Type:** Civil fraud under the False Claims Act; a separate criminal investigation is also underway.

# Judge: Fernando M. Olguin

* **Position:** U.S. District Judge, Central District of California.
* **Appointed by:** President Obama in 2012.
* **Background:** Civil rights experience with DOJ and MALDEF; considered to lean progressive but follows legal precedent.
* **Judicial Style:** No evidence he dismisses more cases than peers; follows standard procedural norms.

# Recent Case Developments:

* **Special Master’s Recommendation:** Suzanne Segal recommended dismissal, citing insufficient evidence.
* **DOJ Response:** Opposed dismissal, supported by 28 House Democrats urging trial.
* **Pending Ruling:** Judge Olguin will decide whether to accept the recommendation.

# Impact of UnitedHealth’s Defense Strategy:

* **Strategy:** Argues no intent to defraud; relied on CMS guidance; faults in government evidence.
* **Historical Precedents:** Similar strategies led to dismissals or settlements in cases involving WellCare, Kaiser, and others.
* **Likely Outcome:** If dismissal is upheld, UNH may avoid trial and criminal charges could weaken.
* **Risk:** If DOJ finds stronger evidence of intent, civil or criminal liabilities could escalate.

# Conclusion:

UnitedHealth currently has a legal edge in the civil case due to weak government evidence and a favorable special master report. The ultimate outcome hinges on Judge Olguin’s decision, which could significantly influence both the civil and ongoing criminal investigations.

  
Medicare Advantage fraud cases yield significant but mid-range FCA recoveries and see a higher incidence of early dismissals compared to other healthcare fraud sectors, where civil penalties often reach or exceed half-a-billion dollars and fewer cases are dismissed on procedural grounds.

  
**Factors Supporting Likely Dismissal**

1. **Special Master's Recommendation:**
   * Special Master Suzanne Segal reviewed extensive evidence and **recommended dismissal**, finding the DOJ had not met its burden to show that UNH knowingly submitted false claims or withheld overpayments.
   * Judges typically give **significant weight** to special master recommendations—especially when they are thorough and procedurally grounded.
2. **Weakness of Government’s Evidence:**
   * The DOJ failed to directly compare submitted diagnosis codes to medical records, instead relying on extrapolations from chart audits.
   * Courts in similar Medicare Advantage cases (e.g., *Sutter Health*, *WellCare*) have emphasized the need for **specific, document-based proof of fraud and intent** under the False Claims Act.
3. **Judicial Efficiency:**
   * Judge Olguin has shown in past cases that he values **efficient use of judicial resources**—often dismissing or staying cases when claims are weak or settlements are pending.
   * The Special Master explicitly cited resource savings as one justification for recommending dismissal.

# Countervailing Considerations

1. **DOJ and Political Pressure:**
   * The DOJ is pushing hard to proceed, and **28 Democratic House members have publicly urged Judge Olguin not to dismiss the case**, citing systemic Medicare Advantage fraud concerns.
   * While judges are not swayed by politics in principle, such a high-profile push could weigh on the optics of a full dismissal.
2. **Possibility of Partial Ruling:**
   * Judge Olguin could **dismiss only part of the case** or allow a limited claim to proceed (e.g., on narrower factual grounds) to demonstrate that the court is giving the DOJ its day in court.
   * He may also allow a jury to weigh intent if he sees close factual questions.

# Bottom Line

* **Probability of Full Dismissal:** **Moderately High (60–70%)**
* **Probability of Partial Dismissal or Narrowed Trial:** **Moderate (20–30%)**
* **Probability of Full Trial Proceeding as DOJ Wants:** **Low (5–10%)**

Judge Olguin is likely to favor procedural clarity and follow the evidentiary standard laid out by the Special Master unless the DOJ introduces substantially stronger proof—something it has not yet done publicly.""

While we await further updates on the case and verbal arguments are supposed to begin in June, there remains a rather high probability that this case will be dismissed or partially dismissed unless the DOJ provides significant new evidence or the DOJ can articulate a strong counter argument to the Special Master's findings. Let us not forget that the ""criminal investigation"" that the WSJ reported on is directly tied to this case, so if the DOJ fails here, there is a very low chance they will aim to prosecute UNH criminally, in my opinion. 

Disclosure: Not a lawyer, just interested in this case because it will have a huge sway on stock performance in the short to medium term if the judge dismisses or allows it to proceed to trial.

My thoughts there: When I saw that in premarket the first yearly level functioned as resistance(293) (originally i assumed it will bounce in the green zone. placed it months ago) it was clear that the next one is targeted. That calls one trend-progression. As you can see did it an extremely strong, 14% V-bottom from that level. With a never beforeseen volume (see picture2).

[Right here: local Resistance. Small zones below: local support](https://preview.redd.it/td0kl7uyo41f1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=de85586d3b9c7f7ed106e1babaa4352e68889a6f)

The conclusion that draw from that: The bottom should be in and every dip can bought . Even one more low should strong get bought up immediately(if that happens,wait until its back above 250 to buy).

Those who are looking for long term can start to DCA already.

1kmv5ff_UNH,UNH,UnitedHealth drops 8% after hours amid criminal investigation for possible Medicare fraud,"Paywall: [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/unitedhealth-medicare-fraud-investigation-df80667f?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/unitedhealth-medicare-fraud-investigation-df80667f?siteid=yhoof2)

The Justice Department is investigating UnitedHealth Group for possible criminal Medicare fraud, people familiar with the matter said.

The healthcare-fraud unit of the Justice Department’s criminal division is overseeing the investigation, the people said, and it has been an active probe since at least last summer. 

While the exact nature of the potential criminal allegations against UnitedHealth is unclear, the people said the federal investigation is focusing on the company’s Medicare Advantage business practices.

UnitedHealth didn’t respond to written questions Wednesday. A DOJ spokesman declined to comment.

The probe adds to a list of government inquiries into the company, including investigations of potential antitrust violations and a civil investigation of its Medicare billing practices, including at its doctors offices.

UnitedHealth is seeking to recover from a meltdown of its stock over its financial performance and the sudden replacement this week of its chief executive officer, Andrew Witty, with its chairman and former CEO Stephen Hemsley. UnitedHealth’s stock has declined by almost 50% over the past month.

Last year, the company faced a hack of a technology unit that disrupted payments to many U.S. health providers for months, and the killing of its top insurance-arm executive.

All of this comes as the Trump administration and Congress look to cut federal health spending, a key source of UnitedHealth’s success. In March, U.S. senators grilled Mehmet Oz, now the Medicare and Medicaid agency head, during his confirmation hearing on the findings of a Wall Street Journal investigation of practices of Medicare Advantage insurers such as UnitedHealth. Oz pledged a crackdown.

The criminal investigation could pose an additional challenge to UnitedHealth in the midst of a deep deficit of trust among shareholders, regulators and customers.

The Justice Department’s criminal healthcare fraud unit focuses on crimes such as kickbacks that trigger higher Medicare and Medicare payments.

The fraud unit has offices in more than a dozen cities, but is managed from DOJ’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors are working on the criminal investigation of UnitedHealth from the fraud unit’s office in New York, the people familiar with the investigation said.

For years, the unit focused on busting doctors, laboratories and other service providers who overbill government health programs and insurers.

But the unit has turned its focus to insurers in the Medicare Advantage system, where they now oversee taxpayer-funded benefits for more than half the seniors and disabled people in the broader Medicare program, people familiar with the matter said. 

Medicare Advantage insurers are paid extra for covering sicker patients, creating an incentive to document diagnoses for patients they cover. In some cases, the Journal’s reporting has shown, questionable diagnoses by UnitedHealth added billions to taxpayers’ costs.

The company disputed the Journal’s findings, saying that its analysis was “inaccurate and biased,” and that Medicare Advantage “provides better health outcomes and more affordable healthcare for millions of seniors” than traditional Medicare.

UnitedHealth’s latest annual securities filing says the company “has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews,” and flags involved agencies including the Justice Department. It doesn’t specifically mention the criminal, civil and antitrust probes the Journal has reported.

UnitedHealth dismissed a Wall Street Journal report in February revealing the civil Medicare fraud investigation into the company as “misinformation” and said that it wasn’t aware of a “new” probe.

A March 11 email, revealed in a lawsuit by a UnitedHealth investor, shows a company lawyer acknowledging that “the government has asked us some questions regarding Optum’s coding practices,” referring to the Medicare billing practices of UnitedHealth’s healthcare services arm, which includes its doctor groups. 

The email, cautioning a former UnitedHealth employee on the possibility of being contacted by the government, described the investigation as “in the early stages.”

A UnitedHealth spokesman said last week that the company stood by its February statement and declined to comment on the email.

The DOJ has struggled to make its case in fraud claims against UnitedHealth in the past. In March, a court-appointed special master recommended that a judge effectively dismiss a whistleblower case against UnitedHealth after concluding the government hadn’t presented evidence that patient diagnoses submitted for payment were inaccurate. The judge in the case hasn’t yet ruled on the recommendation.

That civil case, brought by a former UnitedHealth employee turned whistleblower in 2011 and joined by the government in 2017, concerned claims that UnitedHealth submitted $2 billion worth of diagnoses recorded by doctors that its own reviewers determined weren’t supported by patients’ medical charts. 

The DOJ asked the judge to reject the special master’s recommendation. UnitedHealth said the finding showed “there was no evidence to support the DOJ’s claims we were overpaid or that we did anything wrong.” ",2025-05-15,791,32

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d) \- The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into UnitedHealth Group for ""potential Medicare fraud"" related to its Medicare Advantage business. The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into ""questionable diagnoses"" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal. Other stocks such as HUM/CVS/CI have moved on this as well.

Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term.

1kn076t_UNH,UNH,UNH down nearly 50% in a month — what’s your fresh take?,"UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) has taken a massive hit this past month, dropping from nearly $600 to just $308 — a 47.22% decline. It closed today at $308.01, and after-hours trading pushed it even lower to $283.13 (down another 8%).

This kind of move is rarely seen in a major, well-established healthcare giant. The chart looks brutal — sharp plunge in late April and continued bleed through May.

What’s going on under the hood here? Is this:
	•	An overreaction to short-term bad news?
	•	A structural issue in the business or reimbursement model?
	•	A long-term buying opportunity for value investors?
	•	Or is there more pain to come?

The U.S. health insurance industry has been grappling with increased costs since mid-2023 due to a surge in demand for healthcare services under government-backed Medicare plans for older adults or individuals with disabilities.

In April, UnitedHealth posted its first earnings miss since 2008 and a bleak forecast.

The company expects to return to growth in 2026, it said on Tuesday.

This is a huge move for a stock like UNH—what’s going on behind the scenes?
Leadership shakeup + no forward guidance = not a good combo.

If one of the biggest healthcare players is dropping like this, could this drag down other names in the sector too? Might see XLV and other managed care stocks reacting.

Is this just a short-term reaction or something more serious? Curious what you guys think.

1klcnfj_UNH,UNH,Looking for advice... United Health UNH,"**Hi everybody,**

I just started investing but made a bad play. I saw the Trump news about cutting pharma costs right when he posted it on Truth Social. I thought I was making a “big brain” move by buying health insurance stocks like UnitedHealth, thinking they’d go up since they’d be paying less for medications (that was my logic at the time).

But when Trump officially announced it, UnitedHealth actually dropped further into the $375 range (I bought at $384). After thinking it through a bit more, I realized pharma companies are probably already selling to insurance companies at low prices—likely around the range Trump is aiming for—and it’s the insurance companies that are doing the markup. So it’s pharma stocks that might be okay, and insurance companies that could take the hit.

**What’s the best practice among investors when this happens?**  
I’ve already set a sell order at $370 but I’m unsure if I should sell earlier or hold the stock.

*P.S. I’m okay with losing it all. I just want to know the best practice when someone makes a bad read.*

April 16 was the nightmare day for the stock. Was the problem about tariffs?, doesn't seem like so! It was about the company's performance which the CEO called 'unusual and unacceptable'. The CFO said the company would now expect adjusted earnings of $26 to $26.50 per share yet in January , the company was expecting adjusted earnings of $29.50 to $30. That downward revision of earnings and factors like, unexpected surge in Medicare cost advantage and shareholder lawsuit alleging lack of transparency still stand as reasons for that sharp decline. The decline has since continued its course and of today, it's trading at $387.02.
Technically, it seems like the stock is still on its bearish course. While scary, this appears like a golden opportunity for value investors but with a question, ""when is the right time to buy?""

For example, $540 Call Strike ($15 out of the money) had a bid of .20 ($20 per contract of 100 shares). The $530 call strike ($5 out of the money) had a $1.01 bid per contract just prior to closing. I've only seen bids right around ATM at expiration or 1 cent bids there out of the money at expiration  But we're talking pretty far out of the money strikes with juicy premiums still available right before Friday expiration.

I ended up selling 20+ contracts on various OTM strikes to take advantage of the juicy premiums. I'm not complaining, but any idea why there are such high premiums for out of the money for 0 DTE options?

We are not aware of the “launch” of any “new” activity as reported by the *Journal*.

1iuqidy_UNH,UNH,DOJ Investigates Medicare Billing Practices at UnitedHealth (UNH),"**Link to report:** [https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/unitedhealth-medicare-doj-diagnosis-investigation-66b9f1db?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/unitedhealth-medicare-doj-diagnosis-investigation-66b9f1db?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

The Justice Department has launched an investigation into UnitedHealth Group’s UNH Medicare billing practices in recent months, people familiar with the matter say.

The new civil fraud investigation is examining the company’s practices for recording diagnoses that trigger extra payments to its Medicare Advantage plans, including at physician groups the insurance giant owns. 

A series of articles in The Wall Street Journal last year showed that Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses. Attorneys with the Justice Department as recently as Jan. 31 interviewed medical providers named in the articles.

In the Medicare Advantage system, insurers get lump-sum payments from the federal government to oversee enrollees’ Medicare benefits. When patients have certain diagnoses, the payments go up, creating an incentive to diagnose more diseases. 

The Medicare billing investigation adds to the scrutiny on UnitedHealth, the $400 billion company that owns the largest U.S. health insurer and a sprawling network of other health-industry assets including its doctor practices, a large pharmacy-benefit manager and data and technology operations.

The civil investigation, some of the people said, is separate from a longer-running Justice Department antitrust probe that the Journal reported last February. The DOJ also has sued to block UnitedHealth’s $3.3 billion planned acquisition of home-health company  Amedisys on antitrust grounds

A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, which is also involved in the civil fraud probe, declined to comment. 

UnitedHealth declined to comment. UnitedHealth previously has said its practices lead to more accurate diagnoses, that it performs well in Medicare audits and that its approach benefits patients.

In December, the Journal reported that its analysis of billions of Medicare records showed that patients examined by UnitedHealth-employed doctors had huge increases in lucrative diagnoses after joining the company’s Medicare Advantage plans.

Doctors said UnitedHealth, based in the Minneapolis area, trained them to document revenue-generating diagnoses, including some they felt were obscure or irrelevant. The company also used software to suggest conditions and paid bonuses for considering the suggestions, among other tactics, according to the doctors.

Last summer, the Journal also reported that UnitedHealth added diagnoses to patients’ records for conditions that no doctor treated, which triggered an extra $8.7 billion in federal payments in 2021. The untreated diagnoses stemmed from sources including in-home visits by nurses working for the company’s HouseCalls unit. Each visit by the UnitedHealth-employed nurses was worth an average of $2,735 in additional federal payments a Journal analysis of Medicare data spanning 2019 to 2021 found. 

Last month, Justice Department lawyers from the offices of the U.S. Attorney for Minnesota and the Washington, D.C.-based Civil Division contacted at least three doctors and a nurse practitioner who were named in the Journal’s story on UnitedHealth-owned clinics. One of the people was told the health department’s Office of Inspector General was involved as well.

Three said they were questioned about specific diagnoses UnitedHealth promoted for employees to use with patients, incentive arrangements and pressure to add the diagnoses. At least two provided documents, including a contract with a UnitedHealth unit, to the Justice Department. 

Valerie O’Meara, a nurse practitioner who worked for UnitedHealth in Washington state, said she was interviewed on Jan. 31 by Justice Department attorneys who were interested in the company software that suggested diagnoses and the role of a UnitedHealth manager who she said urged her to make new diagnoses beyond what doctors had treated. 

The attorneys zeroed in on certain diagnoses the company often suggested, such as an obscure hormonal condition called secondary hyperaldosteronism, she said. The Journal’s analysis found the condition was rarely diagnosed by Medicare doctors not working for UnitedHealth.

O’Meara said the attorneys focused on her account of how she was told she could add the hyperaldosteronism diagnosis to patients’ records without a lab test. 

More broadly, she said, “they were looking at, ‘Is this abuse?’ ” 

UnitedHealth has said its practices help detect diseases earlier, saving money for the health system. The company says Medicare Advantage plans generate better health outcomes and reduce costs.

In a press release published on its website on Dec. 30, UnitedHealth said the Journal’s articles “rely on often incomplete and inaccurate data to conduct flawed studies through a murky government ‘agreement’.” 

The Journal’s analyses used data UnitedHealth and other Medicare Advantage insurers themselves submitted to the federal government for payment purposes. Reporters accessed the data under a standard research agreement with the agency overseeing Medicare. 

UnitedHealth has faced investigations of its diagnosis-documenting practices before, and its Medicare payments have been examined in health department inspector general reports. The Justice Department took over an earlier lawsuit by a former UnitedHealth employee alleging the company failed to retract inaccurate diagnoses added to patients’ records. 

UnitedHealth has disputed the allegations against it in that continuing case.",2025-02-21,52,9

getting straight to the point UNH's share price has dropped massively since the death of its CEO. Regardless of what we all think about him or ethics or whatever... Do we think the stock value will (on a long enough time scale) recover. I'm personally optimistic for the following reasons;

Assuming legislation passes placing regulations on the industry, I don't see that being a death sentence. Earnings may take a hit, but there is no way it would destroy such a huge industry. If anything it might have long term benefits for the industry. Additionally, I don't think the upcoming administration will take steps to increase healthcare security for citizens. There is little to no chance of single payer healthcare being a thing for at least 4 years. I've invested in the dip, but I feel safer knowing my overall portfolio value isn't very large so even if it is a big asset not much will go wrong. I'm interested in what all of you think.

> The Federal Trade Commission on Friday sued three large U.S. health companies that negotiate insulin prices, arguing the drug middlemen boost their profits while “artificially” inflating costs for patients.  The suit targets the three biggest so-called pharmacy benefit managers, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum Rx, CVS Health’s
 Caremark and Cigna’s Express Scripts. All are owned by or connected to health insurers and collectively administer about 80% of the nation’s prescriptions, according to the FTC.  The FTC’s lawsuit also includes each PBM’s affiliated group purchasing organization, which brokers drug purchases for hospitals and other health-care providers. PBMs sit at the center of the drug supply chain in the U.S. They negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and federal health plans. They also create lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions. The FTC has been investigating PBMs since 2022. 

> The agency’s suit argues that the three PBMs have created a “perverse” drug rebate system that prioritizes high rebates from drugmakers, which leads to “artificially inflated insulin list prices.” It also alleges that PBMs favor those high-list-price insulins even when more affordable insulins with lower list prices become available.  “Millions of Americans with diabetes need insulin to survive, yet for many of these vulnerable patients, their insulin drug costs have skyrocketed over the past decade thanks in part to powerful PBMs and their greed,” Rahul Rao, deputy director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.  “The FTC’s administrative action seeks to put an end to the Big Three PBMs’ exploitative conduct and marks an important step in fixing a broken system—a fix that could ripple beyond the insulin market and restore healthy competition to drive down drug prices for consumers,” Rao continued. 

> The FTC said it also remains “deeply troubled” by the role insulin manufacturers like Eli Lilly, Danish company Novo Nordisk and French drugmaker Sanofi  play in higher list prices, according to a release from the agency. The three companies control roughly 90% of the U.S. insulin market.",2024-09-20,357,63

From what I can tell from talking to people in the health care industry they’ve already lost about a 3rd of their business. The banks (who are invested in them) are maintaining target price of $675 which is just down right insanity. I have a few positions already which are up 40% but it should be dropping more. Especially with their earnings coming up in April, I just don’t see a future where they don’t have to own up to the fact they compromised millions of peoples personal info, paid a ransom to hackers, and weeks later still can’t stop moving the goal post on when their services will be functioning properly again. Not to mention the countless lawsuits that are already popping up, I even read about class action lawsuits. For the current circumstances I think the market is yet to factor in the true losses that UNH is going to take in the next year or so. Let me know your thoughts",2024-03-08,6,30
1b7q0sx_UNH,UNH,Time to start a position in UNH?,"So with all the stuff thats been happening to UNH and the hack that happened to them. Their stock has been taking a hit and is down about 15% from its ATH and is only about 6.5% from its 2022 bear market lows.

Since 2021/2022 its price been sideways price action but mostly due to it having a \~30 P/E ratio. However, the last 2 years or so even tho price hasnt really moved its continued to increase its revenue which now brings its P/E ratio to average levels of about 19. With it being at the average of only 19, there is still clear room for it to still go down.

The way I see it is that the hack is only short term temporary noise and will eventually recover and continue to new ATHs. I have added this to my watch list as think it may go little lower but wanted to see what you guys think of UNH.",2024-03-06,8,17

13w89k5_UNH,UNH,How should one interpret UNH stock?,If there are a handful of companies to invest in stock wise I would put UNH on that list because they are just so profitable and have over time proven to be a diligent company. When a US citizen thinks of a health insurance company United Healthcare comes to mind before others. Piper Sandler said UNH can rally recently ([https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/this-health-insurance-behemoth-can-rally-more-than-20percent-says-piper-sandler.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/this-health-insurance-behemoth-can-rally-more-than-20percent-says-piper-sandler.html)). I believe UNH can rally big in the coming 2 years - and will possibly be better than investing in your typical ETF simply because small cap will hurt in the coming pseudo-recession. I say pseudo-recession because it will be hard to have a typical recession when there is still approx. 2 jobs for every 1 person. I know I am all over the place with this post but we will continue to have YOY 4% to 6% inflation for the next several years... Unless the Fed hikes 50 basis points literally monthly which they will not do. One more reason to love mega cap stocks like UNH. I feel like my vision is somewhat clouded because all I see is positive for UNH including the fact they have a *lower than most* PE ratio of 21.95 (unheard of these days - Eli Lilly for example is a pharmaceutical company and has a PE of 67.83). I should ask while I am on here it is just normal for health insurance companies to have lower PE? It appears Anthem and Humana also have low PE.,2023-05-31,30,10

rf852x_UNH,UNH,UNH - A Speculative lookback (NYSE: UNH),"Good evening everyone.

For this week’s analysis, I wanted to look back at one of my prior convictions and one that I’m still bullish on.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/kuy6rk/united_healthcare_a_speculation_analysis_nyse_unh/)

Updated numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH/dividends/scorecard) and [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UNH/unitedhealth-group/revenue) as of Dec 12, 2021

-----------       |  Last year | 2021
-----------------------------|--------|----
P/E Ratio                   | 20.87 | 25.39
Stock Price                | $363.39 | $478.23
Annual Payout/Share | $5.00 | $5.80
Yield             | 1.38% | 1.21%
10 Yr Div Growth Rate | 28.13% | 24.77%
3 Yr Div Growth Rate | 18.88% | 17.52%
1 Yr Div Growth Rate | 16.67% | 15.88%
Years of Div Growth   | 11 | 12
Payout Ratio               | 29.83% | 30.79%
Free Cash Flow/Share | 20.96 | 24.2
Revenue          | 60.901B* | 72.337B
LT Debt/Equity Ratio        | 0.61* | 0.5917
LT Debt/EBITDA Ratio     | 1.10  | 1.7338
* = Recalculated 

The PE ratio is higher than normal. That said this seems to be happening to the entire market, so I am willing to forgive this point. That dividend growth and capital appreciation leave me happy. A 20% revenue growth in 2 years is not bad. I am not as happy with the debt spikes.

## Year in review
- UNH introducing a health plan to lower costs for patients
- Adding a Bioinformatics program at Harris-Stowe State University
- Supporting eliminating race from kidney diagnosis
- Addressing health disparities across races, ethnicities, genders, geographic boundaries, and education
- Partnering with Eli Lilly for COVID treatment
- launching Level2, a digital therapy for people with type 2 diabetes
- Partnering with Microsoft to launch ProtectWell for return-to-workplace planning and COVID symptom screening

## Thoughts
Certainly one can see that UNH is committed to equal treatment for all and advancing treatment. From adding more programs to making strides towards eliminating biases in patient treatment, all can easily be shown as better care. The plan to reduce premiums by 15% further shows their commitment to providing better care and reducing costs. I would like to see the debt drop but covid treatment seems to be an unending cycle. I have no doubt that UNH has an abundance of growth avenues for the future. Whether or not it is a good price point to enter, I leave to the reader.

No crystal ball reading for this week. Next week will be the lookback of stocks ever since the first review.

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research. Thank you for reading, please give me feedback so that I can increase my standards for future analysis posts.

If I have made a mistake, please correct me. Or if you have one that you want an analysis on, I might pick a comment to do an analysis of if I don't have any spice stored for the week.",2021-12-13,12,6

So wondering if now is a good time to add a few shares or will it drop to $200 or under? Thoughts?

Also I like UNH and have abput 6.4% portfolio in it now and have gained about 25% since adding it less than a year ago.

They say UNH new target is over $500 for high target and low is now $420 I think.  Should I add a little more to UNH?

I have 6.4 % UNH, but tech (mostly faang) is 50% of my portfolio.

mnrm97_UNH,UNH,Thoughts on UNH C-Suite Shakeup - Why? Key Implications?,"At first blush, David Wichmann's (“W”) departure from $UNH CEO role looked abrupt and the choice of his replacement a head scratcher, but you have to dig a few levels deeper to understand the motives for the Board and the important implications. 

[https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/unitedhealth-s-wichmann-to-earn-2-years-salary-bonuses-post-retirement](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/unitedhealth-s-wichmann-to-earn-2-years-salary-bonuses-post-retirement)

1. W was CEO for 3.5 years which is very short compared to the average S&P 500 CEO tenure of 10.2 years. It’s even more exceptional given that prior to W $UNH had had only 3 CEOs in its 40-year history. 

’77 – ’89 Richard Burke (12)

’89 – ’06 William McGuire (17)

’06 – ’17 Stephen Hemsley (11)

’17 – ’21 David Wichmann (4)

2. The Company in its press release did not allow Wichmann to include a statement nor any other Board member congratulated him on his 23-year career with the Company. *UnitedHealth said that Wichmann decided to retire after the pandemic reaffirmed the importance of family for him.* 

3. Ok, so there is little doubt that W was fired. Key question is why? On the surface things were looking pretty good, earnings grew 18.8% ’17-’20 cagr, stock price was up by a similar amount. 

4. Looking one layer deeper, one can say that W was riding on the success of the platform put in place by his predecessor. There is some support for this in the #s – W cut capex % of cash from ops to 11% from >16% in prior periods. On an inorganic basis, he acquired DMG, Equian and CHNG (pending), but none of these were transformative like Catamaran or Amil. 

5. This happened while $UNH peers were successfully catching up. So, from the outside one can speculate that W lost the lead UNH had over its peers. This is significant since $UNH had been several years ahead of peers in its thinking about an integrated healthcare offering. 

6. Next, another unpleasant news came to the fore during W’s tenure. A whistleblower at UNH leaked Steve Nelson’s criticism of Medicare for All. 

[*https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/12/weve-done-lot-more-than-you-would-think-how-health-insurance-industry-is-working-pull-democrats-away-medicare-for-all/*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/12/weve-done-lot-more-than-you-would-think-how-health-insurance-industry-is-working-pull-democrats-away-medicare-for-all/)

7. This put an unpleasant spotlight on $UNH’s back:

8. Surprisingly, even though Nelson was shortly thereafter let go, W did not come out strongly against Nelson. In fact, he continued to push back against Medicare for All. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/16/unitedhealth-warns-medicare-for-all-would-destabilize-us-health-system.html

9. Finally, a competitor, $CNC started its UK expansion in ’17 and has continued to make further inroads. Why is this relevant? Note, $UNH has had international ambitions for a long time. The 2012 acquisition of Amil hasn’t gone well. Perhaps UK is/was a better market and $UNH is not the first mover? 

[https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/nhs-privatisation-resisting-centene](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/nhs-privatisation-resisting-centene)

10. In conclusion, I think the $UNH board made the right decision. $UNH’s needs to build up its traditional lead over peers and needs to execute on a long-term vision. This vision needs new solutions for better care at lower costs and providing insurance to the un-/under-insured. As importantly, $UNH needs to act boldly and urgently to address the competitive threat from $AMZN, $TDOC and the like. 

11. Is Andrew Witty the right choice to take on these important challenges? The Board definitely thinks so as they’ve been progressing his alongside W as if they’d anticipated this day the moment W was named CEO :)",2021-04-09,11,0

[*https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/12/weve-done-lot-more-than-you-would-think-how-health-insurance-industry-is-working-pull-democrats-away-medicare-for-all/*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/12/weve-done-lot-more-than-you-would-think-how-health-insurance-industry-is-working-pull-democrats-away-medicare-for-all/)

7. This put an unpleasant spotlight on $UNH’s back:

8. Surprisingly, even though Nelson was shortly thereafter let go, W did not come out strongly against Nelson. In fact, he continued to push back against Medicare for All.

9. Finally, a competitor, $CNC started its UK expansion in ’17 and has continued to make further inroads. Why is this relevant? Note, $UNH has had international ambitions for a long time. The 2012 acquisition of Amil hasn’t gone well. Perhaps UK is/was a better market and $UNH is not the first mover? 

[https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/nhs-privatisation-resisting-centene](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/nhs-privatisation-resisting-centene)

10. In conclusion, I think the $UNH board made the right decision. $UNH’s needs to build up its traditional lead over peers and needs to execute on a long-term vision. This vision needs new solutions for better care at lower costs and providing insurance to the un-/under-insured. As importantly, $UNH needs to act boldly and urgently to address the competitive threat from $AMZN, $TDOC and the like. 

11. Is Andrew Witty the right choice to take on these important challenges? The Board definitely thinks so as they’ve been progressing his alongside W as if they’d anticipated this day the moment W was named CEO :)",2021-04-09,11,0

kuy6rk_UNH,UNH,United Healthcare- A speculation analysis (NYSE: UNH),"# Introduction:

Welcome back to my weekly stock analysis. Let me not waste time with the standard “I am very bullish on this stock” spiel. 

United Healthcare (NYSE: UNH)
Sector: Healthcare (Healthcare Plans)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
United Healthcare is a healthcare product and insurance company. They are ranked #7 on the Fortune 500 list and ranks second among healthcare providers (behind CVS). UNH owns Optum which provides technology-backed healthcare. UNH also claims to be reducing costs while still being committed to providing better care, with reduced costs.

Strengths:
- Ranked 7th on fortune 500
- 20.83% 5 year growth rate
- 29% payout ratio
- 1.38% yield
- very strong growth (23% 1 year growth, 86% recovery from the crash, 230% 5 year)
- Revenue growth 24% on the quarter, strong year after year.
- Free cash flow per share growth rate has been double digit over the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year marks.
- Healthcare as a sector or even as a subsector is essential. It’s not going anywhere. Might as well ride the healthcare wave.

Risks:
- 1.38% yield. I am certain I will get comments about this being so low yielding.
- 11 year dividend growth. While not insignificant, it’s no aristocrat.
- Focusing on Optum so not leveraging more on debt to grow faster. This can be a positive or negative aspect, I leave it here to show they can afford more debt but choose not to
- same 96 million customers served from Q4 2019 as to Q1 2021. It did grow from 93 million in Q1 2020 to this 96 million though.
- Covid response: They do not have any guidance to the length of covid and the time to recover on the global scale. They expect a stronger recovery when the work force returns but are focusing on the “now” in that respect.
-  Lags behind the rest of the health sector

Debt / EBITDA            | 1.10

Historic yield: ~3%

United Healthcare seems to have one of the strongest cash flows I’ve evaluated. It has an 11 year dividend growth streak, 30% payout ratio, and really strong debt ratios. One of the only downsides that I can find is that they are not using affordable debt for more acquisitions. With a debt to equity ratio of .515 and debt to ebitda ratio of 1.1, anyone can see that they can afford more debt. The fact that UNH chooses not to, while still producing double digit revenue growths, double digit free cash flow growths, and double digit dividend growths means that this company can afford to raise the dividend for years while still committing to growth. 

Potential payout based on 3 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary). 

 Year | UNH

2022 |  5.83
2023 |  6.93
2024 |  8.38
2025 |  10.74


## Final Thoughts:
UNH is a very strong addition to a portfolio and is not discussed as much as ABBV, JNJ, PFE or any of the other names. I think UNH is as good if not better. I’m excited to see if UNH decides to take on more debt on another acquisition or partnership. Especially with the rumors of UNH buying out Change Healthcare. UNH says they are focusing on growing Optum to a 100B company in the meantime. I leave the decision to the reader though.

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research.

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

#### 

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

PUBLISHED TUE, OCT 15 20192:10 AM EDTUPDATED MOMENTS AGO


Stocks traded higher on Tuesday as the corporate earnings season got off to a strong start.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 200 points, or 0.8%. The S&P 500 gained 0.7% along with the Nasdaq Composite.

“The early reporters must not have gotten the memo from market bears stating that we are in an earnings recession,” said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout.

J.P. Morgan Chase shares jumped 2.5% after its third-quarter numbers topped analyst expectations. The company’s revenue also hit a record, boosted by home and auto loans along with credit cards.

UnitedHealth, another Dow member, posted a quarterly profit that topped analyst expectations by 13 cents per share. The company’s results got a boost from growing pharmacy benefits. UnitedHealth also hiked its full-year earnings guidance. UnitedHealth shares climbed 7.3%.

Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, saw its third-quarter numbers lifted by higher sales of cancer and other prescription drugs. The numbers sent the stock up by 2.3%.

&#x200B;

UNH has some serious headwinds on its way that I don't think are accurately reflected in its share price. The US government recently disclosed that they will be blocking the safety harbor on drug kickbacks (rebates). Here's the [source](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/01/31/trump-administration-proposes-to-lower-drug-costs-by-targeting-backdoor-rebates-and-encouraging-direct-discounts-to-patients.html). Health insurers make a fucking killing on rebates, especially under Medicare Part D. In fact, an insurer may actually make money by 'paying' for a drug since a rebate can be larger than the cost. The incentivized arn't lined up since the gov covers 80% of the price under Part D.

&#x200B;

**Trump wants to lower drug prices by changing the rebate structure under Part D** [source](https://www.cms.gov/blog/proposed-changes-lower-drug-prices-medicare-advantage-and-part-d)

&#x200B;

Spending under medicare Part D has gotten outta control since Obama care and has grown at 20%/yr since 2009. Gross spending under Part D was over $100 billion in FY2018. Since 2009, UNH stock has increased as well, from $25/share in 2009 to $256/share in 2019 - which is about a 23% compound rate. UNH has grown in line with the growth in medicare Part D spending. As discussed in the link above, starting in 2020, those rebates are going bye bye. UNH is about to lose a lot of earnings power. Bearish.",2019-03-08,4,9

4n5rpt_UNH,UNH,UnitedHealth - A conservative growth stock with steadily increasing income,"Health Insurers set drug prices. They have massive datasets that are both broad and deep. The industry is rapidly consolidating through both vertical and horizontal integration.

The network effect is strong and UnitedHealth is the largest insurer. They invest heavily in technology through their subsidiary Optum and sell services to other insurers and providers. They are transitioning from an insurance company to an arbiter of healthcare prices and they are investing heavily into technology to help them do so. 
 
In my opinion you get the best of many worlds with this stock. As the largest health insurer in an industry that benefits from scale they have a wide moat. Their investments in technology should provide growth opportunities for many years to come. Currently their dividend pays 1.5% and has been growing ~30% yoy since 2010.

Being an insurer they are subject to political risks. Having withdrawn from the healthcare.gov marketplaces they've taken steps to limit this exposure. Single payer healthcare would kill off their insurance business but Optum would still be strong and would likely sell its services to the government.
