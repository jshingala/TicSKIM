Shares of United Parcel Service Inc. surged in early trading Tuesday, after the package-delivery giant’s earnings beat Wall Street expectations, which offset announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year due to the loss of Amazon volume.

The company also said it would not update its full-year outlook “given the current macro-economic uncertainty.” The company had previously said it expected 2025 revenue of $89 billion.

UPS said it began a “network configuration” that will lead to consolidations of its workforce and facilities, in anticipation of the loss of volume from its largest customer, Amazon.com Inc.

That will include cutting about 20,000 jobs, or roughly 4% of its workforce, in 2025. The company will close 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of the year.

UPS said it expects total cost savings from its consolidation of $3.5 billion in 2025. Additional buildings may be closed as it continues to review its network.

Due to its actions, UPS expects to record between $400 million and $500 million in expenses, including building closures and employee severance benefits. The job cuts may also lead to a “re-measurement” of its pension plan obligations, but UPS could not yet determine the impact.

For the first quarter to March 31, net income rose 6.6% from the same period a year ago to $1.19 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, increased to $1.49 from $1.43, and beat the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of $1.38.

Revenue slipped 0.7% to $21.5 billion, but was above the FactSet consensus of $21.0 billion.

1jd4x1a_UPS,UPS,UPS: At least It pays you.,"UPS pulls in $91B in revenue, about half from ground shipping. Net income looks rough, margins are compressed, and despite revenue being well above pre-COVID levels, earnings haven’t caught up.

Assets sit at $70B, liabilities at $53.3B, and equity at $16.7B. Market cap is $99B, so at least there’s some equity, but they’re struggling to turn revenue into profit.

Biggest expense? Labor. Compensation and benefits alone eat up $48B, with another $13.6B going to purchased transportation, $4.4B to fuel, and $3.6B to depreciation. So UPS is cutting costs. First, the Fit to Serve plan—14,000 management jobs gone, saving $1B a year, though they take a $416M hit in severance. Then Efficiency Re-Imagined, shutting down 10% of buildings, shrinking fleets, and more job cuts for another $1B in savings. Most of this is hitting management, not union workers.

And yet, the most interesting part? The dividend yield is the highest it’s been in 25 years. Whether that means the market re-rates the stock higher or they just keep handing out cash, who knows. But given how little else stands out, that’s probably what people will care about most.

# Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff

  
Apple’s latest earnings were a classic case of “good enough.” Revenue climbed 4% to $124.3 billion, but iPhone sales dipped nearly 1% to $69.1 billion—marking yet another quarter where flashy AI features failed to spark an upgrade frenzy. Investors shrugged it off, sending shares up 3% after hours, thanks to Apple’s Services division. The segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud, hit a record $26.3 billion in revenue, proving that if people won’t buy new iPhones, they’ll at least keep paying for storage and subscriptions.

**China Fumbles, AI Stumbles**  
  
Apple’s China problem isn’t going away. Revenue from the region cratered 11% to $18.5 billion as domestic brands like Huawei surged ahead. Tim Cook blamed “inventory reductions” for the slump, but the real issue? Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in China, leaving its iPhones looking second-rate against AI-powered local competition. The fix? Apple plans to roll out Chinese-language AI in April, but whether that move will actually win back market share is TBD.

**Tariffs, Trump, and Trouble**  
  
Beyond China, Apple is bracing for Trump-era tariffs 2.0, with the administration mulling new levies on Chinese imports. Last time, Cook managed to schmooze his way out of hefty tariffs—he even made an appearance at Trump’s inauguration last week. But with Apple still manufacturing most of its products in China, a trade war could throw a wrench into margins. Meanwhile, Apple’s decision to sit out the AI spending arms race is looking smarter by the day, as rivals like Microsoft and Google face Wall Street backlash for runaway costs.

**The AI Waiting Game**  
  
Apple’s AI rollout has been... underwhelming. The much-hyped Apple Intelligence features haven’t moved the needle, and early issues—like botched notification summaries—haven’t helped. While Cook insists Apple’s ecosystem will make its AI the best in the long run, consumers aren’t exactly rushing to upgrade. Investors are still buying the vision, but if Apple wants AI to be more than a talking point, it needs to start delivering results.

# UPS to Amazon: “It’s Not Me, It’s You”’

UPS just pulled a classic “we need to talk” on Amazon, slashing its business with the e-commerce giant by more than 50% by 2026. The reason? Amazon might be its biggest customer, but it’s also its least profitable. UPS would rather focus on high-margin shipments, even if it means losing billions in revenue. Investors, however, weren’t sold on the plan—shares cratered 14%, their worst drop since 2008.

**Amazon Shrugs, UPS Scrambles**  
  
While UPS is downsizing its Amazon deal, Amazon has spent the past decade building its own logistics empire, so it’s hardly sweating the breakup. In fact, it had even offered to ship more with UPS, but the courier declined, choosing to prioritize profitability over volume. Meanwhile, FedEx made a similar move back in 2019, cutting Amazon loose and shifting focus to higher-margin clients. That strategy paid off, leaving UPS now scrambling to course-correct with cost-cutting measures and a push into more lucrative segments like healthcare and business-to-business shipping.

**Less Amazon, More Headaches**  
  
UPS is rolling out a $1 billion cost-cutting plan, closing facilities, downsizing its fleet, and cutting jobs to offset the revenue loss. It’s also ditching its last-mile delivery partnership with the U.S. Postal Service, opting to handle more deliveries in-house. While the moves are meant to boost margins, the immediate impact isn’t pretty—UPS is bracing for a revenue drop in 2025, falling short of analysts’ expectations.

**What’s Next?**  
  
CEO Carol Tomé promised more details on UPS' long-term strategy soon—maybe by the end of Q1—but for now, Wall Street isn’t convinced. The big bet is that fewer Amazon packages will mean higher margins, but in the short term, UPS is taking a financial punch to the gut. Investors are left wondering: will this be a painful but necessary pivot, or just a costly breakup?

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The week’s final act? A crucial inflation gut check. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index—aka the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—drops today, and while Jerome Powell tried to sound optimistic in yesterday’s press conference, prices are still running hotter than he’d like. If today’s data shows inflation cooling, markets will start dreaming of rate cuts in March. If not, brace for more Fed-induced suspense.

Earnings season isn’t done yet, with a fresh batch of heavyweights reporting, including Colgate-Palmolive ($CL), Church & Dwight ($CHD), AbbVie ($ABBV), Phillips 66 ($PSX), and Eaton Corporation ($ETN). Expect Wall Street to comb through the numbers for any signs of consumer fatigue or corporate pricing power—because in this economy, margins matter more than ever.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Exxon Mobil** is stuck in neutral, but that might be just fine. The energy giant has eked out a 5% gain over the past year, underperforming broader markets but keeping its valuation attractive. If President Trump’s “drill baby, drill” mantra becomes policy, Exxon is well-positioned to cash in. Its diversified operations mean it can weather price swings while still delivering strong returns. Consensus: $1.79 EPS, $88.23 billion in revenue. ($XOM)
* **Chevron** isn’t winning any speed races either, but slow and steady could pay off. The stock has only climbed single digits in the past year, but with a solid balance sheet, a juicy dividend, and a shift toward long-term investments beyond crude, it’s playing the long game. While lower oil prices may squeeze near-term profits, any shift away from clean energy policies could boost its prospects. Consensus: $2.40 EPS, $48.68 billion in revenue. ($CVX)",2025-01-31,23,1

# UPS to Amazon: “It’s Not Me, It’s You”’

UPS just pulled a classic “we need to talk” on Amazon, slashing its business with the e-commerce giant by more than 50% by 2026. The reason? Amazon might be its biggest customer, but it’s also its least profitable. UPS would rather focus on high-margin shipments, even if it means losing billions in revenue. Investors, however, weren’t sold on the plan—shares cratered 14%, their worst drop since 2008.

**Amazon Shrugs, UPS Scrambles**  
  
While UPS is downsizing its Amazon deal, Amazon has spent the past decade building its own logistics empire, so it’s hardly sweating the breakup. In fact, it had even offered to ship more with UPS, but the courier declined, choosing to prioritize profitability over volume. Meanwhile, FedEx made a similar move back in 2019, cutting Amazon loose and shifting focus to higher-margin clients. That strategy paid off, leaving UPS now scrambling to course-correct with cost-cutting measures and a push into more lucrative segments like healthcare and business-to-business shipping.

**Less Amazon, More Headaches**  
  
UPS is rolling out a $1 billion cost-cutting plan, closing facilities, downsizing its fleet, and cutting jobs to offset the revenue loss. It’s also ditching its last-mile delivery partnership with the U.S. Postal Service, opting to handle more deliveries in-house. While the moves are meant to boost margins, the immediate impact isn’t pretty—UPS is bracing for a revenue drop in 2025, falling short of analysts’ expectations.

**What’s Next?**  
  
CEO Carol Tomé promised more details on UPS' long-term strategy soon—maybe by the end of Q1—but for now, Wall Street isn’t convinced. The big bet is that fewer Amazon packages will mean higher margins, but in the short term, UPS is taking a financial punch to the gut. Investors are left wondering: will this be a painful but necessary pivot, or just a costly breakup?

# Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff

  
Apple’s latest earnings were a classic case of “good enough.” Revenue climbed 4% to $124.3 billion, but iPhone sales dipped nearly 1% to $69.1 billion—marking yet another quarter where flashy AI features failed to spark an upgrade frenzy. Investors shrugged it off, sending shares up 3% after hours, thanks to Apple’s Services division. The segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud, hit a record $26.3 billion in revenue, proving that if people won’t buy new iPhones, they’ll at least keep paying for storage and subscriptions.

**China Fumbles, AI Stumbles**  
  
Apple’s China problem isn’t going away. Revenue from the region cratered 11% to $18.5 billion as domestic brands like Huawei surged ahead. Tim Cook blamed “inventory reductions” for the slump, but the real issue? Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in China, leaving its iPhones looking second-rate against AI-powered local competition. The fix? Apple plans to roll out Chinese-language AI in April, but whether that move will actually win back market share is TBD.

**Tariffs, Trump, and Trouble**  
  
Beyond China, Apple is bracing for Trump-era tariffs 2.0, with the administration mulling new levies on Chinese imports. Last time, Cook managed to schmooze his way out of hefty tariffs—he even made an appearance at Trump’s inauguration last week. But with Apple still manufacturing most of its products in China, a trade war could throw a wrench into margins. Meanwhile, Apple’s decision to sit out the AI spending arms race is looking smarter by the day, as rivals like Microsoft and Google face Wall Street backlash for runaway costs.

**The AI Waiting Game**  
  
Apple’s AI rollout has been... underwhelming. The much-hyped Apple Intelligence features haven’t moved the needle, and early issues—like botched notification summaries—haven’t helped. While Cook insists Apple’s ecosystem will make its AI the best in the long run, consumers aren’t exactly rushing to upgrade. Investors are still buying the vision, but if Apple wants AI to be more than a talking point, it needs to start delivering results.

# Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff

  
Apple’s latest earnings were a classic case of “good enough.” Revenue climbed 4% to $124.3 billion, but iPhone sales dipped nearly 1% to $69.1 billion—marking yet another quarter where flashy AI features failed to spark an upgrade frenzy. Investors shrugged it off, sending shares up 3% after hours, thanks to Apple’s Services division. The segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud, hit a record $26.3 billion in revenue, proving that if people won’t buy new iPhones, they’ll at least keep paying for storage and subscriptions.

**China Fumbles, AI Stumbles**  
  
Apple’s China problem isn’t going away. Revenue from the region cratered 11% to $18.5 billion as domestic brands like Huawei surged ahead. Tim Cook blamed “inventory reductions” for the slump, but the real issue? Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in China, leaving its iPhones looking second-rate against AI-powered local competition. The fix? Apple plans to roll out Chinese-language AI in April, but whether that move will actually win back market share is TBD.

**Tariffs, Trump, and Trouble**  
  
Beyond China, Apple is bracing for Trump-era tariffs 2.0, with the administration mulling new levies on Chinese imports. Last time, Cook managed to schmooze his way out of hefty tariffs—he even made an appearance at Trump’s inauguration last week. But with Apple still manufacturing most of its products in China, a trade war could throw a wrench into margins. Meanwhile, Apple’s decision to sit out the AI spending arms race is looking smarter by the day, as rivals like Microsoft and Google face Wall Street backlash for runaway costs.

**The AI Waiting Game**  
  
Apple’s AI rollout has been... underwhelming. The much-hyped Apple Intelligence features haven’t moved the needle, and early issues—like botched notification summaries—haven’t helped. While Cook insists Apple’s ecosystem will make its AI the best in the long run, consumers aren’t exactly rushing to upgrade. Investors are still buying the vision, but if Apple wants AI to be more than a talking point, it needs to start delivering results.

# UPS to Amazon: “It’s Not Me, It’s You”’

UPS just pulled a classic “we need to talk” on Amazon, slashing its business with the e-commerce giant by more than 50% by 2026. The reason? Amazon might be its biggest customer, but it’s also its least profitable. UPS would rather focus on high-margin shipments, even if it means losing billions in revenue. Investors, however, weren’t sold on the plan—shares cratered 14%, their worst drop since 2008.

**Amazon Shrugs, UPS Scrambles**  
  
While UPS is downsizing its Amazon deal, Amazon has spent the past decade building its own logistics empire, so it’s hardly sweating the breakup. In fact, it had even offered to ship more with UPS, but the courier declined, choosing to prioritize profitability over volume. Meanwhile, FedEx made a similar move back in 2019, cutting Amazon loose and shifting focus to higher-margin clients. That strategy paid off, leaving UPS now scrambling to course-correct with cost-cutting measures and a push into more lucrative segments like healthcare and business-to-business shipping.

**Less Amazon, More Headaches**  
  
UPS is rolling out a $1 billion cost-cutting plan, closing facilities, downsizing its fleet, and cutting jobs to offset the revenue loss. It’s also ditching its last-mile delivery partnership with the U.S. Postal Service, opting to handle more deliveries in-house. While the moves are meant to boost margins, the immediate impact isn’t pretty—UPS is bracing for a revenue drop in 2025, falling short of analysts’ expectations.

**What’s Next?**  
  
CEO Carol Tomé promised more details on UPS' long-term strategy soon—maybe by the end of Q1—but for now, Wall Street isn’t convinced. The big bet is that fewer Amazon packages will mean higher margins, but in the short term, UPS is taking a financial punch to the gut. Investors are left wondering: will this be a painful but necessary pivot, or just a costly breakup?

The week’s final act? A crucial inflation gut check. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index—aka the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—drops today, and while Jerome Powell tried to sound optimistic in yesterday’s press conference, prices are still running hotter than he’d like. If today’s data shows inflation cooling, markets will start dreaming of rate cuts in March. If not, brace for more Fed-induced suspense.

Earnings season isn’t done yet, with a fresh batch of heavyweights reporting, including Colgate-Palmolive ($CL), Church & Dwight ($CHD), AbbVie ($ABBV), Phillips 66 ($PSX), and Eaton Corporation ($ETN). Expect Wall Street to comb through the numbers for any signs of consumer fatigue or corporate pricing power—because in this economy, margins matter more than ever.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index—aka the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—drops today, and while Jerome Powell tried to sound optimistic in yesterday’s press conference, prices are still running hotter than he’d like. If today’s data shows inflation cooling, markets will start dreaming of rate cuts in March. If not, brace for more Fed-induced suspense.

Earnings season isn’t done yet, with a fresh batch of heavyweights reporting, including Colgate-Palmolive ($CL), Church & Dwight ($CHD), AbbVie ($ABBV), Phillips 66 ($PSX), and Eaton Corporation ($ETN). Expect Wall Street to comb through the numbers for any signs of consumer fatigue or corporate pricing power—because in this economy, margins matter more than ever.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Exxon Mobil** is stuck in neutral, but that might be just fine. The energy giant has eked out a 5% gain over the past year, underperforming broader markets but keeping its valuation attractive. If President Trump’s “drill baby, drill” mantra becomes policy, Exxon is well-positioned to cash in. Its diversified operations mean it can weather price swings while still delivering strong returns. Consensus: $1.79 EPS, $88.23 billion in revenue. ($XOM)
* **Chevron** isn’t winning any speed races either, but slow and steady could pay off. The stock has only climbed single digits in the past year, but with a solid balance sheet, a juicy dividend, and a shift toward long-term investments beyond crude, it’s playing the long game. While lower oil prices may squeeze near-term profits, any shift away from clean energy policies could boost its prospects. Consensus: $2.40 EPS, $48.68 billion in revenue. ($CVX)",2025-01-31,23,1

# Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff

  
Apple’s latest earnings were a classic case of “good enough.” Revenue climbed 4% to $124.3 billion, but iPhone sales dipped nearly 1% to $69.1 billion—marking yet another quarter where flashy AI features failed to spark an upgrade frenzy. Investors shrugged it off, sending shares up 3% after hours, thanks to Apple’s Services division. The segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud, hit a record $26.3 billion in revenue, proving that if people won’t buy new iPhones, they’ll at least keep paying for storage and subscriptions.

**China Fumbles, AI Stumbles**  
  
Apple’s China problem isn’t going away. Revenue from the region cratered 11% to $18.5 billion as domestic brands like Huawei surged ahead. Tim Cook blamed “inventory reductions” for the slump, but the real issue? Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in China, leaving its iPhones looking second-rate against AI-powered local competition. The fix? Apple plans to roll out Chinese-language AI in April, but whether that move will actually win back market share is TBD.

**Tariffs, Trump, and Trouble**  
  
Beyond China, Apple is bracing for Trump-era tariffs 2.0, with the administration mulling new levies on Chinese imports. Last time, Cook managed to schmooze his way out of hefty tariffs—he even made an appearance at Trump’s inauguration last week. But with Apple still manufacturing most of its products in China, a trade war could throw a wrench into margins. Meanwhile, Apple’s decision to sit out the AI spending arms race is looking smarter by the day, as rivals like Microsoft and Google face Wall Street backlash for runaway costs.

**The AI Waiting Game**  
  
Apple’s AI rollout has been... underwhelming. The much-hyped Apple Intelligence features haven’t moved the needle, and early issues—like botched notification summaries—haven’t helped. While Cook insists Apple’s ecosystem will make its AI the best in the long run, consumers aren’t exactly rushing to upgrade. Investors are still buying the vision, but if Apple wants AI to be more than a talking point, it needs to start delivering results.

# UPS to Amazon: “It’s Not Me, It’s You”’

UPS just pulled a classic “we need to talk” on Amazon, slashing its business with the e-commerce giant by more than 50% by 2026. The reason? Amazon might be its biggest customer, but it’s also its least profitable. UPS would rather focus on high-margin shipments, even if it means losing billions in revenue. Investors, however, weren’t sold on the plan—shares cratered 14%, their worst drop since 2008.

**Amazon Shrugs, UPS Scrambles**  
  
While UPS is downsizing its Amazon deal, Amazon has spent the past decade building its own logistics empire, so it’s hardly sweating the breakup. In fact, it had even offered to ship more with UPS, but the courier declined, choosing to prioritize profitability over volume. Meanwhile, FedEx made a similar move back in 2019, cutting Amazon loose and shifting focus to higher-margin clients. That strategy paid off, leaving UPS now scrambling to course-correct with cost-cutting measures and a push into more lucrative segments like healthcare and business-to-business shipping.

**Less Amazon, More Headaches**  
  
UPS is rolling out a $1 billion cost-cutting plan, closing facilities, downsizing its fleet, and cutting jobs to offset the revenue loss. It’s also ditching its last-mile delivery partnership with the U.S. Postal Service, opting to handle more deliveries in-house. While the moves are meant to boost margins, the immediate impact isn’t pretty—UPS is bracing for a revenue drop in 2025, falling short of analysts’ expectations.

**What’s Next?**  
  
CEO Carol Tomé promised more details on UPS' long-term strategy soon—maybe by the end of Q1—but for now, Wall Street isn’t convinced. The big bet is that fewer Amazon packages will mean higher margins, but in the short term, UPS is taking a financial punch to the gut. Investors are left wondering: will this be a painful but necessary pivot, or just a costly breakup?

I'm looking yield that's safe, paid by a company with forward looking growth. That is to say, I want to have my cake & eat it too. Can I company pay 3%+ divi and see 3%+ appreciation in underlying value...I think yes. Here's 4 companies that I think can do it:

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Pfizer - $26.50**

Dividend Yield 6.34%

P/E Ratio14.48

Why Buy Now: Extremely beaten down since COVID. Fears of what RFK will do once in office has sent investors running. Fear and uncertainty around the pharma industry has taken this stock to the basement.

Thesis: [CEO of Pfizer met with Trump/RFK at Mar-a-Lago](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-eli-lilly-and-phrma-ceos-joined-trump-mar-lago-dinner-industry-collaboration-cures) & said there'll be no major shift in pharma policy. Pfizer has slowly repositioned itself away from [COVID vaccines & into the world's largest Oncology treatment provider](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-pitches-pipeline-priorities-oncology-220351290.html). Pfizer has already given 2025 forward guidance & just increased their dividend a month ago. They've also beaten earnings last 5 in a row.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
**Kraft - $29.25**

Dividend Yield 5.52%

P/E Ratio11.97

Why Buy Now: This is a triple whammy - Inflation, Tariffs, RFK. This triple headwinds have dragged this stock below it's previous support. It's on the verge of pricing in all time new lows.

Thesis: Kraft-Heinz is the third-largest food and beverage firm in North America with massive portfolio of top brands.  Further consolidation in Food/Bev will help Kraft continue to capture more and more of the market. Kraft saw in increase with returns on spending & continued to show their strong supply lines helped them navigate recent supply line shocks.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Verizon - $38.00**

Dividend Yield 7.07%

P/E Ratio13.89

Why Buy Now: Verizon's balance sheet & intensive capital investments have soured investors. Combine a weaking balance sheet with attractive high yield low risk assets elsewhere and you've got a tough environment for Verizon.

Thesis: Verizon has the largest customer base in the US, is the most efficient carrier in the industry, and delivers better profits than any of it's industry rivals. As yields elsewhere come down & Verizon strengthens their balance sheet, we should see a recovery in Verizon's share price.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**United Parcel Service - $130.00**

Dividend Yield 5.02%

P/E Ratio13.17

Why Buy Now: Union pressure, high wages, tight job market have continued to drag on UPS. Pressure from Amazon's own shipping has forced UPS to take on more & more low-revenue volume. Lower revenue streams combined with higher wages have put pressure on UPS share price.

Thesis: Bank of American just upgraded UPS this week, stating ""BofA's proprietary Truck Shipper Survey Demand Indicator ticked up to its highest level in more than three years. The firm takes that as a sign that the shipping market is on the cusp of growth once again."" As wage pressure drops & increases in shipping market, should help propel UPS forward in the upcoming year(s).",2025-01-17,24,35

1hrfq3h_COP,COP,Thoughts and takeaways from my trading year. 468% return with lots of ups and downs.,"I started 2024 with just under 200k in my trading accounts. In march I got to just under a mil with MSTR, riot & mara calls when the btc ETFs were approved. Like a true degen I didn't stop buying OTM calls and went back down to a low of 250k in July. Caught the btc run up this fall and at my peak had 1.8 mil. I withdrew quite a lot of money to buy a house, pay taxes and spend some $. With the withdrawals taken into account, I finished with about 1.1M, netting a 468% return on the year. I don't know too many people that can say they lost 600K twice in one year and still out performed the S&P by over 20x lol.

https://preview.redd.it/858qxkc0wgae1.jpg?width=1378&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=610e1ef2fd52e3802cc81f5184c2ec0119fbb217

My mindset this year was that the money in the account isn't real until it's withdrawn or taxed. Until then, they're just points in a game. You have to be ready to lose your money or position in order to win big. Big losses are not the end of the world.

My take aways from the year:

\- Short term capital gains taxes suck. Although nothing beats the rush of a big OTM call option hitting, remember you have to pay short term capital gains tax on that, which in the big leagues is nearly half. If you can find stocks you're long on (more than a year) you can save a bunch of your profit in taxes (long term cap gains instead).

\- Learn to step away after a big win. You don't need to be in positions all the time. My biggest losses were right after my biggest wins. Patience: ""The markets have a habit of transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

\- When OTM calls hit, take profit! If you're still long on the stock, buy the stock and sell covered calls, or sell cash secured puts and use the wheel strategy if assigned. No need to risk a big loss on another OTM gamble. Usually the premiums are juicy after a big run up due to high IV and you can take the premium and buy OTM calls or more stock once you think it's bottomed out after a big run.

\- Always DCA in and DCA out. When entering a trade, put 1/3 of what you want to put into it at your entry. Put a limit buy in for another 1/3 of what you first think a good stop loss will be, unless your thesis changes. Save the last 1/3 for further confirmation of the trend once you're in profit if you think it's still going to run. Generally, take 1/3 profit around 33%, another 1/3 at 66%, the last 3rd of your position is now house money. It can go to 0 and you will still break even.

\- Always continue to learn about chart patterns, indicators, trading/options techniques, anything you can really. You will (almost certainly) never be the most knowledgeable. Learn from those who have more experience and knowledge than you. There's plenty of resources out there, Instagram traders, discords, books... etc.

\- Learn from your big losses instead of beating yourself up; every loss is a learning opportunity. Why did you enter the trade in the first place? Most of the time it's greed & emotions instead of good analysis. Learn to read & anticipate chart patterns and don't force a trade. Wait for confirmation before entering a trade. Last but most important, stop doing weekly options. 30-90 days out were money for me. It's fun to throw a little money on some 0 dte's here and there but take profits or losses quick.

One of my favorite moments this year was meeting with my financial planner and banker in the summer. I told them about how I went from almost a mil down to 250K. The look on their face was priceless (talking about you Nick). I am also sharing this post with them ;)

Looking forward:

1) I am still going to be trading a lot of crypto stocks. Although I don't hold any MSTR right now, I will likely jump back into it. Their NAV multiplier is relatively low at 1.7 right now. I think when (not if) btc takes off again the mNAV will go back above 2. Looking to enter at under 1.7 mNAV. If I don't find a good entry on MSTR, I will do IBIT calls. In the likely scenario where the new administration announces a strategic BTC reserve, I think we will see north of 300K btc this year. I suspect we will have about 30 days of accumulation in BTC with downwards or sideways price action and then strong upwards push once inauguration happens.

2) Power to the players stonk: I hold a good bit of this stonk in another account. Will continue to accumulate slowly unless we have some major price action then I will be buying OTM calls or doing call spreads.

3) Honing my day trading / swing trading of SPY. I still have a lot to learn about day trading, but when I have traded 1-7 dte SPY calls or puts (very small positions), I have north of a 50% win rate. If I can cop 10-20% gains on small trades consistently, it adds up and it builds a lot of knowledge and experience.

  
Happy New Years all and stay regarded!

Let me try to justify why:","One reason could be that Intel (INTC) is currently making significant strides in the semiconductor industry, positioning itself as a key player in next-generation technology like AI, cloud computing, and 5G infrastructure. 

With the ongoing demand for chips, Intel’s long-term growth potential may look more promising compared to more traditional sectors like shipping or entertainment.

Furthermore, Intel might be trading at a more attractive valuation, offering a better entry point for potential upside as they undergo business transformations under their new leadership.

1ehwlau_UPS,UPS,High quality UPS taken to the woodshed - buying opportunity?,"UPS stock dropped significantly due to a combination of factors, including disappointing quarterly earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations, reduced full-year revenue guidance, and weak demand in the shipping sector. The company reported a decline in average daily volume and a substantial drop in operating profit for its U.S. Domestic Package division.  UPS warned that the current quarter would be particularly challenging, projecting a 40% year-over-year profit decline. These challenges, along with aggressive cost-cutting measures and underperformance compared to competitors, contributed to negative investor sentiment and a significant decrease in share price.

However from a value perspective UPS stock is currently at deep discount to its 10 year median price metrics.

While the stock may take time to revive, value investors may want to buy when things look hairy for the eventual rebound.  A stock like UPS rarely stays down for long.  Also if Trump wins he will inflate the economy like crazy with even bigger deficits and UPS will likely be a prime beneficiary.

* High IVR (Implied Volatility Rank): 90.5 indicates that the current implied volatility is higher than 90.5% of the past year's readings

1dlkad2_MS,MS,"An Excellent resource with write ups, from the school that started Value Investing. ","""Value Investing was developed in the 1920s at **Columbia Business School** by finance adjunct **Benjamin Graham** (1894-1976) and finance professor **David Dodd** MS ’21 (1885-1988). The professors were co-authors of the classic text, **Security Analysis (1934)** and are regarded as the field’s pioneers.""

At the **Heilbrunn Center for Graham & Dodd Investing** at Columbia University, **Thomas Russo** started a Student investment fund, and called it the 5x5x5, *""‘5x5x5’ simply means to have five investments, with no more than five articulated reasons for each investment and then hold those investments for five years.*""

I found the stocks investment articles very well written, and an inspiration on the thought process deployed and the range of tools for valuation used by the students.

for anyone who wants to think or learn about investing about the long term, here are some of the companies articles published on the website ( plus the student names and the year of the article).

I see a lot of familiar names, and news ones.

1d8cxd6_UPS,UPS,"Meme Stock AND Normal Stock Watchlist: Momentum Set-Ups ($HOLO, $CRDL, $AMC, $RNXT, $NVOS) ","How’s it going everyone! The market is getting interesting again, and there have been a lot of stocks that have been thriving in these market conditions. With  u/DeepFu\*\*\*\*\*Value posting for a second time, I feel that this meme stock frenzy is not going anywhere anytime soon… 

I wanted to make a watchlist for both people who are looking for meme stocks and investors who are looking at more sound investments/swings. I also wanted to point out for those that saw my last swing watchlist, $GLDG has already had a 10% move to the upside and nearly hit $1. Be ready to take your profits! Okay, now to the new stocks that are on my watchlist. 

*The Non-Meme Watchlist*

1. **$CRDL**

* Trend and Pattern: The chart shows an ascending channel pattern, characterized by upward-sloping parallel trendlines. The stock has been respecting this channel since November 2023, consistently making **higher highs and higher lows**.
* Recent Price Action: The stock broke out of the channel last Friday, but pulled back to the top of the channel. 
* MACD: Remains bullish on the daily chart
* The Set Up - $3 is not out of the question Looking for a bounce around this area and for this stock to continue it’s rise. However, I would have a stop loss below the channel just in case this pulls back even more. 

1. **$RNXT** - The Swing into July

* Trend and Pattern: The chart exhibits a descending triangle pattern, typically a bearish continuation pattern. The stock has been making lower highs, indicating sustained selling pressure.
* Support Area: There is a strong support area around 1.07, where the price is currently testing. $1 will also act as support. 
* Recent Price Action: Had a bad day on Monday, down 7%.
* The Set Up: Looking for $1 to hold and for the price to get back $1.20. Will be watching the volume and looking to deploy if it gets closer to $1. T**he closer it gets, the better risk to reward you will have**. (if you implement a stop loss)

*The Meme Watchlist* 

1. **$HOLO** - Currently being heavily shorted with what seems to be a strong community trying to create a short squeeze. We shall see if this happens.
2. **$AMC** - Very little price action right now outside of its recent pump in mid may, but was once a meme stock for a little bit, so you never know. 
3. **$NVOS** - Maybe not necessarily a meme stock, but whenever $NVOS pumps, it has similar price action to them. This one recently shot up over 150% so be careful with this one please.

\~Let me know if there is a meme stock that I am missing!\~ - edit: For Science

17bgo1o_TSLA,TSLA,These 3 EV start-ups that rode the Tesla wave are now penny stocks.,"**As investors sought the next Tesla (TSLA), a slew of EV stocks popped up at the start of this decade. Following exciting debuts, three electric vehicle start-ups are now trading as penny stocks.**

**1. Nikola ($NKLA),** In recent trading, the stock price of Nikola, an electric vehicle (EV) start-ups that was once promising, fell by more than 8% to $1.03. The company's stock price fell sharply by 33% in October, and it has already lost over half of its worth for the year. At first, Nikola was valued at more than $3 billion when it went public in June 2020 through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal, with great expectations to become the ""Tesla of trucking."" But soon after making its debut, the stock peaked at more than $90 per share, and it has been steadily declining ever since. 

**2. Fisker ($FSR)**, an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, had its stock fall 3.5% to $5.92 in recent trading. Although it briefly traded below $5 per share over the summer, it has subsequently recovered some of its value. Fisker went public in October 2020 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction valued at $2.9 billion at the time. However, a few months later, its stock reached a peak of over $32 and has been steadily declining since then. The stock is down 8% this month and has lost roughly 20% of its value year to date, illustrating the company's struggles in a competitive EV market.

**3. Lucid ($LCID),** an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, had its stock fall by more than 9% to $4.53, setting a new 52-week low. The stock has dropped 18% this month and has lost one-third of its value year to date. Lucid went public in July 2021 via a large $24 billion SPAC offering, and its shares quickly rose beyond $64 per share. However, it has been steadily declining since then, with only sporadic short-term rises. Lucid's recent problems include a nearly 30% decline in EV manufacturing in the third quarter and dismal Q3 EV deliveries, despite efforts to attract buyers with discounts and lower-cost models.",2023-10-19,11,19

* Part time workers will make $21 from currently $15.50.
* Full time workers will be paid $49 an hour an increase of $7.50 over the contract.  Total compensation with benefits will be $170,000.  
* Average base pay before overtime or benefits will be approximately $102,000.
* The new contract includes pay raises for both part-time and full-time workers.
* It also includes other improvements to work rules including an end to forced overtime.
* Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2.

American Airlines also approved 46% increase in compensation and the UAW is also demanding 46% increase in compensation, voting on August 22nd whether or not to authorize a strike.

UPS workers ratified a massive five-year labor deal that includes big wage increases and other improvements to work rules and schedules, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Tuesday.

The deal passed with 86.3% of votes, the highest contract vote in the history of Teamsters at UPS, according to the union.

“Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement.

UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.

UPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It’s the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.

Part-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.

UPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tomé said on an earnings call earlier this month.

The company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the “volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.”

The union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.

On Monday, American Airlines
pilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots’ union. Delta Air Lines

’ pilots approved their deal, which include more than 30% raises, earlier this year.

Southwest Airlines

hasn’t yet gotten to a deal with its pilots’ union, which has laid the groundwork for a potential strike, though such stoppages in the airline industry are exceedingly rare under U.S. laws.

UPS and the union representing more than 300,000 workers at the package carrier on Tuesday said they reached a preliminary labor deal, narrowly avoiding a strike that was set to start in the coming days.  
  
“Together we reached a win-win-win agreement on the issues that are important to Teamsters leadership, our employees and to UPS and our customers,” UPS CEO Carol Tome. “This agreement continues to reward UPS’s full- and part-time employees with industry-leading pay and benefits while retaining the flexibility we need to stay competitive, serve our customers and keep our business strong.”  
  
The tentative deal still faces a ratification vote by workers.  
  
The union had planned a massive strike after July 31 if the two sides didn’t reach a deal.  
  
The Teamsters said the deal includes wage increases for both full- and part-time workers.  
  
“The union went into this fight committed to winning for our members. We demanded the best contract in the history of UPS, and we got it,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement. “UPS has put $30 billion in new money on the table as a direct result of these negotiations.""",2023-07-25,649,180

Unfortunately, I have one investment account that has a large position of AT&T stock that represents a 45% decline from its invested value. I was buying this stock for the dividend 2018. basis is about $25 per share   

I have the same situation with Verizon shares with a position that is down 37% from its invested value.   

Ford  down 29%
Struggling because of trying to sell EV vehicles. Just announce Cutting prices so the stock dropped on the news. 

Abbott down  22% 
Been waiting for almost 24 months for it to return to invested cost, but it seems that the market does not like Abbott for the problems that had over a year ago with baby formula

Paramont, the old CBS down 50%
I have held this for 24 months, but evidently because of cord cutting, and the move to streaming this probably will not play out to get back to my invested cost. 

Intel down 34%
I probably should go ahead and add to this position, because long-term Intel will be OK because of their investment in domestic production.

Citi Bank down 16%
I guess we will see if this pulls up with earnings. If it does, I will try to get out when even with invested cost.

$UPS  down 12%
Concerned regarding their teamster union problems. If they go on strike I am sure UPS will go down 25%. It probably will not recover back to its current level in 2023.  Long-term it’s probably a good investment, but I probably should move the cash to something that might get a better return, or for that matter even treasuries at 5% 

From the Cash standpoint I don’t need to sell any of these  I can hold it and wait but I don’t like having dead money in a stock. It would allow me to sell some gainers that I have big increases like Apple.   But I don’t like selling.  

Would you DCA when this hits the bottom or just cut bait.  

Again I don’t need the cash today.
 but I am smart enough to know some of the positions will never get back to the invested cost.  

Most of these companies were purchased for the dividend. 
This does not represent my entire portfolio. I have lots of gainers and strong dividend producers.

Been investing, 45+ years so my horizon is very long-term as it would be going into my estate versus my needing to live of the investments.",2023-07-17,17,41

141lxel_DG,DG,UPS a Potential Value Play,"The market has been on a tear since hitting its lows in October during the 2022 Bear Market. With the recent run up in the market due to the AI craze value plays seem hard to come by. I have seen some people talk about Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), and PayPal (PYPL). However I think there is a potential for UPS to be one too. 

United Parcel Service (UPS) is a shipping company that is a major provider in the global supply chain management. They have a domestic US segment and an international segment. Their international segment operates all over the globe. This includes places like the Pacific, Africa, Europe, Latin America, India, and the Middle East. They are crucial part of the US infrastructure as well as the US economy. 

The stock is currently down 28% from its all time high due to shrinking company earnings and fears of a world wide recession that will impact their earnings even more. If we look at net income going back to December 2013 it was 4.37 billion. In December 2019 it was 4.44 billion. Basically earnings were flat for a good amount of time. UPS saw a huge spike in earnings during 2021 and net income climbed all the way to 12 billion in December 2021. 

The question that is on investors minds is whether this earnings is sustainable and how far will see earnings drop if its not. In the most recent quarter in March 2023 UPS did about 1.89 billion in net income which is a almost a 29% decline from their last 2022 March quarter of 2.66 billion. 

Currently valuation sits pretty low. Its trading at a 13 P/E ratio. If we use enterprise value and stock based compensation their free cash flow ratio is currently at about 20. Still pretty high especially for a company with declining earnings. Enterprise value to Ebitda is 9 which really low. Overall though they have pretty stable financials. Current ratio is good and very low debt. Pretty solid financial position if we see bad economic times. 

Their current dividend yield is about 3.8%. Their dividend eats up about 58% of their free cash flow. I would not expect this to grow much if we continue to see this contraction on earnings. They also repurchase stock pretty consistently. 

I posted this on r/valueinvesting but I figured since it has a high dividend I figured you guys maybe interested too.",2023-06-05,7,2

Amazon also launched free shipping software for sellers, and discounted shipping rates. Amazon has piled money into its logistics capability over the past few years, to the point it has excess capacity for its own needs and is hungry for more share which is being targeted through FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) and could be weighing on FedEx. I’d be buying Amazon on weakness here.""

10rti7x_UPS,UPS,$BBBY trying to perform a Short Squeeze again + Long and Short trade set ups for $BLFE + $BBBY,"Been seeing a lot of talk about people trying get Bed Bath and Beyond to perform one of its short squeezes again. I personally do not own any  shares of BBBY, so I am giving an unbiased opinion of where this stock could go.

https://preview.redd.it/xljyvb98usfa1.jpg?width=2256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86b4324705de363613fd507d0907a9f9f8775a26

If $BBBY does end up performing the short squeeze, I could see it definitely see it getting to the $6 range again, but MAX $10. If it were to get there I would recommend taking profits!! However, this could easily get back to all time lows and you could lose a lot of money. Make sure to have a tight stop loss if you plan on entering. of course this isn't financial advice what so ever!

https://preview.redd.it/vrwh28t6xsfa1.jpg?width=2270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c916d89a4407dac86958abc385b202d4dc49f5ea

For $BLFE I would be looking to catch the bottom here and nothing more. Have a tight tight stop loss in just in case because it could easily continue to go lower. If it is somehow the bottom, I recommend taking your initial investment out and letting the rest ride. Not financial advice of course :). I hope this post helps you make some bread or at least keeps you safe!

It was no surprise that we the S&P had its first red month all year last month. The question is will our portfolios keep being drug down by inflation and debt ceiling woes. If you are not already, now is the time to dollar cost average on your long term positions, and pick yourself out some new mid term positions that you think will perform well in the winter months.

#  First let's take a look at some of my favorites.

**TQQQ** has given up a lot of ground since it's all time high on September 7th. It is now approaching the 180MA, and the RSI is really low. It could be a great time to average into this position. If you prefer options, a bounce of the 180 alerts has been set. 

https://preview.redd.it/6ceb8y1sjqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=3611585e424b757718c9dba3f0afefadb634c9a8

 **UPRO** is not as bad as **TQQQ**, and that is quite normal according to Trend Spider's seasonality. Usually this time of year, the Nasdaq does worse out of all the indices. Now we see that tech is getting hammered. I'd also DCA into this one.  

https://preview.redd.it/vh23d1szjqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a31491eb4a487f24f2f872db5e11f32ca41e89e

 **UDOW** is probably a great pick up right now for your buy and hold portfolio. It is riding along the 180MA, and if you can get an entry there, start to DCA.

 **SOXL** is notorious in our community for money printing swings. I'd say it might have bottomed out of now. There seems to be a 50/50 chance over the past decade that SOXL is up/down in October. Since it is already down, I'd say grab some, and continue to as long as it is going down. Red day buy; green day hold. Let it run until mid November. Hope you are paying attention :D

#  Crypto 

 **CRO**, the native Crypto.com token and one of my favorites right now has made a wonderful recovery bounce off of the 180MA. It is now back at 18 cents. Don't sleep on this one. They are now the sponsors of the UFC and the Philadelphia 76ers. I think this is a 10x play. I think the right play here is buy what you can afford: $400, $4000 or $40000. Stake those in their app (for up to 14%apy), since it is a long term play anyways we don't need to use this money. After, you will unlock their metal Visa card. My recommendation is run all your monthly expenses through it and you'll be getting 2-5% back in **CRO** which you continue holding.

**BTC** has made a huge recovery this week, and if you are already diversified with BTC exposure congratulate yourself. If not, maybe its time to start considering it. If traditional equity markets are not doing well, money sometimes flows to crypto - and vice versa.

#  Alerts 

 A **WMT** opportunity found by my VIP Discord members. First of all, the seasonality improves a lot in November and the RSI looks way to over sold. I like a bounce off of the the lower support of a paralell channel that it seems to be trading in. This could be a good chance for some EOY calls either now, or wait for bounce.  

https://preview.redd.it/qztvc4h8kqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=012816a5a8ba2a561beaadecb7a9fee4cc4d3b7a

 **XHB**, a homebuilders ETF, LEAPS look ripe for the picking. This would be a long term position with exposure to the US new homes sector, which I don't think will slow down any time soon.  

https://preview.redd.it/d3sallk9kqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=09d918825aedf4ff92ceb2917309b12ba69ccba8

 Here is an interesting opportunity for some puts on **CRM** I believe to have found. We are close to all time high, and the seasonality starts to suck going into December. I can't really say the exact point where we buy the puts, but I think maybe around $280. We can even buy vertical spreads for $270/$260 with a December expiration. 

https://preview.redd.it/kctpebkakqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3d15a26bfe10680a774553e53c78204b3a97a3e

 **NKE** has also taken a beating and will probably have decent holiday sales as always. Actually, this alert was already set and expired before it triggered. It is basically riding along the 180MA and the YTD VWAP. Could be a good pick up now, or wait for a confirmation bounce.  

https://preview.redd.it/nu6sb4jbkqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8f911359729ed6031498e5aae401a786bf2ff98

 Same with my **HD** alert. It triggered last week but I was on vacation and missed it. If you bought, you'd be making money. I'll be resetting the alerts for a VWAP bounce and trying again.  

https://preview.redd.it/tb2uejeckqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=985ad4ea1a62d29579da96945a756cc0da8a614c

 I'm still liking these **SPOT** puts as I don't believe in the long term growth of this company. It seems like the resistance drawn out is true and is holding. If continues, there is an opportunity to arb calls and puts between the resistance and glass bottom (yellow). 

https://preview.redd.it/hcie2cgdkqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f8bd58cebd73066512ce8e675a98095ac1cdae

 Still continue to play **DIS** on its yoyo like bounce on the glass bottom. Usually **DIS's** seasonality improves in the winter months, especially in November. I still like EOY calls, probably taking profit in November.  

https://preview.redd.it/2lclpzaekqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=329098a02d6d7b241e153cb149a12cb84693ba8a

 It is interesting that this time, when BTC ran, **EBON** didn't. One of my highest conviction plays, I'll wait for the bounce down from the 50MA as usual. **EBON** is a crap company, with crap products, that industry insiders joke about.  

https://preview.redd.it/ozpj252fkqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb701f35e2d14a8945e771a8787425fc8698885

 **MCB** is a tricky play, but, like I thought, it is holding resistance. I think its a matter of time before it pulls back. If we see it break the resistance, then I'll cut. Go small here.  

https://preview.redd.it/vf7usk4gkqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=d18e08d1ea0c8c33cbfbf1fc788e3566e3ec7ffb

 **SBUX** is around major supports and has somewhat of a nice volume shelf propping it up. Seasonality is good for October and November as cold caffeine addicted shoppers go out and need warm pick-me-uppers. I like calls off of the volume shelf expiring EOY and taking profits possibly in November.  

https://preview.redd.it/n2lkvt0hkqr71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfe6ac15beda08ad064d92c429436c65b943e2f0

 Lastly for today, I still like **T** puts off of the 50MA. Another company that I don't believe in long term growth; this is a good opportunity to continue the ride down. I would keep positions small and take profits quick, although it seems that there is more than a 50% chance that month over month is negative.

pj9fs8_PATH,PATH,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD: V, UPS, PRPL, PATH","This week we saw some CRAZY action in a few names that began to trend around social media. Let’s look at the following charts: SKLZ, VIH, and BBIG. Eventually traders FOMO’d into the trade chasing 25-100% gains… but it’s important to note that these high-reward plays are also VERY risky.

Remember, nobody really knows where a stock will go. As an investor or swing-trader it’s your duty to manage risk and use entry points that are suitable for protecting your hard-earned dollars.

&#x200B;

If you are swing-trading, as many of us enjoy doing, there are a few rules I live by when entering a position:

* If it’s based on sentiment avoid the red zones (FOMO zones) that I usually highlight on the charts. I try entering on a green or orange zone for the best risk/reward if it’s on a name I’d like to take a chance with.
* If it’s based on technicals, WAIT for the opportunity. There are hundreds of high-quality stocks, you don’t need to jump into a trade because it’s hot right now. Be patient with your entries and I guarantee you will become a better trader.

&#x200B;

For those of you that don’t remember or haven’t read some of my earlier posts.

**Red Zone** = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play.

**Orange Zone** = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone.

**Green Zone** = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade.

Here are the charts.

&#x200B;

**SKLZ**

https://preview.redd.it/5mwndl4sdyl71.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3e8afccf6e95119636dc1abcd1303ce7a5eb80b

SKLZ took off early in the week. The red zones are clearly defined on days the stock went up 10-25%. This is a chart with a very short-term timeframe, so the orange level is still somewhat risky. If SKLZ drops back into the green zone, it might be a better entry level. Note: I had this stock on my list a few weeks ago at $13.50, currently sitting at $12. This goes to show not all my watch-list stocks are winners.

&#x200B;

**VIH**

https://preview.redd.it/ejnd150tdyl71.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=5edf3eca81603b2de7b2116cbc00a0d9775f2c02

This SPAC started trending Thursday and Friday after the share price increased 15%. I’m going to stay away from this name since, generally speaking, the general SPAC trade that was popular earlier this year has been extremely under-performing since April.

&#x200B;

**BBIG**

https://preview.redd.it/qgrzwdqtdyl71.png?width=2428&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ba57ad183b52e059bc25c8ed3e9ee29d6ef2585

BBIG is a name that has trended BIGLY on Reddit and Twitter, pun intended. The stock squeezed to $5 in June and then fell to nearly $2 a share just two weeks ago. This is a great example of how one bad FOMO trade can completely wreck your portfolio. Those who were chasing this name in June at $4 after the stock doubled saw their positions cut in half by July.

A few weeks ago and back in the $2-3 range the risk/reward was becoming more favorable, but after recent price action it’s in my no-fly zone. Personally, if this gets back to $5-6 it might look interesting, but not right now.

&#x200B;

# What’s the difference between trading on technicals or sentiment?

&#x200B;

Whether you are trading on technicals or hype, they are very similar. They BOTH require lots of patience and waiting for the correct entry. Here are some points describing them:

&#x200B;

*Sentiment/Hype*

* Avoid FOMO/red zones
* Patiently wait for hype around the stock to calm down to pre-squeeze levels
* Are known to have explosive squeezes that can yield a 40-50% or more return in a matter of days
* Sentiment stocks are known to catch new waves frequently (think AMC in February and then again recently in May/June)

&#x200B;

*Technicals*

* Identify uptrends, support/resistance, break-outs, and consolidation
* Wait for the stock to get to your entry point
* Swing-trading on technicals can yield 10-30% per play

&#x200B;

The goal is to help identify plays that have become favorable for a swing-trade. This requires lots of patience, but can be very rewarding if you stick to the process. When you have at least a 6-month time-frame/outlook when getting into a position you greatly increase your chances of turning it into a winner.

&#x200B;

Don’t aim for 100% gains in one week.

Aim for 20-30% return in 6 months.

&#x200B;

This, of course, works for long-term buy and holds as well as medium-term swing trades. My portfolio is divided into the following two segments:

1. Long-term holds (6-months to 2 year outlook)
2. Swing-trades (come out profitable in 6 months, if it happens earlier that’s great, but not expected)

I want to make it clear that I absolutely never day-trade.

&#x200B;

Soon I am going to move my swing-trade segment of my portfolio to a different broker so I can highlight trades and make them easier to display.

Visa is at short-term lows. The upward channel/trend just broke down and it is currently sitting at support of \~$225. I might enter here looking for a bounce back to $240-250 level. My short-term risk is potentially seeing this at $210, a 6% loss, while I think the upside could be 10-20%. Visa is also a relatively safe blue chip stock that pays a dividend and RSI is hitting some solid over-sold ratings.

&#x200B;

**UPS**

https://preview.redd.it/xlansygseyl71.png?width=2446&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d4b402fb782a0bd2a4d322bbe6ed0daa6fd659

UPS’ share price took a hit after earnings just a month ago. It consolidated for a full month and has recently crossed back over the 50 EMA (orange line), while sitting right at the 100 EMA (dotted blue line). We might see that earnings gap get filled and a bounce back to $210 level.

With the holiday season coming up it would be wise to keep an eye on economical data such as retail sales, consumer spending, and e-commerce earnings reports.

I like UPS at this price.

Purple Mattress has been in a slow decline since May. I think we’ll find some support here at the $23 range. It will face some resistance at $30 level, but if it gets enough momentum to go past we could see this back in the $35 range. PRPL has been known to pick up on social hype and it could be an interesting entry point for a swing trade here.

NOTE: Earnings Tuesday September 7th after the close. UI Path IPO’d in April and is down 25% from the highs. PATH is a growth stock so this is more on the risky side. I am LONG shares of PATH from about $61, currently $63. ARKK ETF currently holds this stock at roughly 2% weight of the ETF.

Alibaba Group Holding Limited, through its subsidiaries, provides online and mobile commerce businesses in the People's Republic of China and internationally. It operates through four segments: Core Commerce, Cloud Computing, Digital Media and Entertainment, and Innovation Initiatives and Others.

Although BABA is still in a bearish pattern, it is hard to find an analyst that doesn't have a 'buy' rating for the e-commerce goliath of Asia. There are major resistances that it is hovering around right now which it has rejected 4 times since its ATH in last October. More so now, the 50 day MA is here as well. Overall, I am bullish on BABA and if we can have another buying opportunity at the bottom support (purple line), I will be getting into calls around $220.

Verisk Analytics, Inc. provides data analytics solutions in the United States and internationally. It provides predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe and weather risk, global risk analytics, natural resources intelligence, economic forecasting, commercial banking and finance, and various other fields. The company operates through three segments: Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets, and Financial Services.

Currently, VRSK is possibly bouncing on major support dating back to the March 2019 lows. I will wait until today to confirm a 'bounce' and if true, I like the $180 monthly calls.

 Next, I've back tested data on a multi factor alert strategy on $SPY. Once the Stochastic RSI forms a bull cross on the day candles and only if the RSI is less than a constant value of 20. This has returned almost a 90% success rate in a little over a year. Once this triggers again, I will buy SPY weekly calls and only taking profit after 2-3 days.

The Travelers Companies, Inc., through its subsidiaries, provides a range of commercial and personal property, and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals in the United states and internationally. The company operates through three segments: Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance, and Personal Insurance.

$TRV has been doing rather well and has found strong support along the 50 day MA. If it pulls back to this support, I believe calls up to $170 will work well here. TRV has been trading within a paralell channel since May of last year.

gharp1_UPS,UPS,A Guide to SEC Regulation for Start-Ups and Small Corporations [OC],"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e4quu4jch0y41.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=976f7a235e7af07536d88533bc32413c9f47edfd

During the 2008 crisis Uber, Airbnb, and other unicorns were created. This is some general registration advice for the future generation of unicorns being created during this crisis.

There are several securities registration exemptions that small corporations / start-ups can use depending on which one best fits the needs of the corporation. Using a securities registration exemption can help reduce some of the legal and accounting costs compared to a typical public offering of a security. The pros and cons of the following exemptions will be discussed in detail: Regulation A+ (Tier 1 and Tier 2), Regulation D (rules 504, 506(b), and 506(c)), Regulation Crowdfunding, and Intrastate Crowdfunding (rules 147 and 147a). The main differences between the exemptions are:

* How much companies can raise under each (offering limit)
* Regulatory oversight  

   * Filing requirements
   * Disclosure requirements
* Legal and accounting costs of the offering
* Who companies can solicit their offering to and who is eligible to invest
* Whether or not state regulatory laws are preempted
* Resale of securities

Regulation A is a securities registration exemption that has two tiers. For a 12-month period, the offering limit is $20 million or less for Tier 1 and $50 million or less for Tier 2. Offering under $20 million can elect to register the securities under either Tier. Under both Tier 1 and Tier 2, the company issuing the shares (issuer) must file an offering statement on Form 1-A with the SEC. This includes offering materials, two years of financial statements and an exit report. An issuer can only accept payment for the sale of its securities once its offering statement is qualified by the staff at the SEC. This SEC qualification requirement will still result in hefty filing and legal fees. General solicitation is permitted (you can freely advertise and talk about the advertising), and there are no restrictions on the subsequent resale of the securities offering. In addition, non-accredited investors are eligible investors.

There are relatively few differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 besides the offering limits. For Tier 1 offerings, in addition to filing Form 1-A with the SEC for review and qualification, state securities regulators will likely also review and qualify required offering materials. Companies offering securities under Tier 1 do not have ongoing reporting requirements other than a final report on Form 1-Z on the status of the offering and are subject to state regulation known as “blue sky” laws. There are no investment limits under Tier 1. Unlike Tier 1, offerings made under Tier 2 have slightly more stringent reporting requirements including ongoing annual and semi-annual reports after the offering is closed. Tier 2 offerings are not subject “blue sky” laws because federal law preempts state securities regulation. Under Tier 2, non-accredited investors are subject to certain investment limits. Although securities exempted under Regulation A are far less complicated and costly than an initial public offering (IPO), this can be a lengthy and expensive process for start-ups. Regulation A is primarily used to help growth companies raise money from non-accredited investors in a “mini-IPO” style offering as a potential alternative to institutional capital.

Regulation D is another set of securities registration exemption governed by Rules 504 and 506. Offerings under Rule 504 are limited to 5 million or less within a 12-month period, and anyone can invest in the offering. Exemptions under Rule 506 have no offering limits and is also preempts state securities law. Rule 506(c) only allows accredited investors, and Rule 506(b) allows for a maximum of 35 sophisticated non-accredited investors. For Regulation D exemptions, issuers must file Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering, and the resale of the securities is restricted. Under 506(b), additional information is required for sales to non-accredited investors. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D exemptions do not have to wait for qualification to accept payment. The main difference between Regulation D exemptions is that general solicitation (advertising) is allowed under Rule 506(c), only in limited circumstances under Rule 504, and not permitted under Rule 506(b). Start-ups generally prefer Regulation D for its relatively lower cost and fast turnaround.

Regulation Crowdfunding is another securities registration exemption that allows companies to raise up to $1.07 million from both accredited and non-accredited investors within a 12-month period. General solicitation of the offering is permitted with some limitations after Form C (similar to Form 1-A) has been filed which includes two years of certified financial statements. Unlike other exemptions, Regulation CF offerings must be offered solely through an online platform operated by an intermediary registered as either a broker-dealer or a registered funding portal. Regulation CF preempts state law, and the securities sold in the offering are subject to certain transfer restrictions for 12 months. Typically, Regulation CF is geared towards startups who plan to raise money entirely through the internet.

Intrastate Crowdfunding is another set of securities registration exemptions governed by Rules 147 and 147a. Intrastate CF offerings have no offering limit, but the issuer must be an in-state resident and “doing business” in-state. Only in-state residents can invest in an Intrastate CF offering. Intrastate CF offerings have no SEC filing requirements but are subject to state securities registration laws. Securities sold through Intrastate CF offerings can only be resold in-state for a 6-month period. The only difference between Rule 147 and 147a is that under 147a, issuers are allowed to be organized in a different state and are allowed to solicit offerees outside of the state. Intrastate CF is primarily for companies that operate in-state and plan for a community-based offering instead of a broad-based internet offering.

For small corporations, Regulation D Rule 506(c) seems like the best option to fulfill the companies initial goals. This recommendation is based on the following assumptions: 1. The goal is to raise $5-20 million in the initial round, 2. corporations would like to advertise on the internet including social media, 3. corporations is looking to keep the cost of the offering as low as possible, and 4. corporations wants to operate in all 50 states. Here, Regulation CF is not viable options because the offering limit is too low for corporations’s fundraising goals. Also, Regulation CF is less preferable because it requires a registered intermediary to conduct the offering. In addition, based on the last assumption, Intrastate CF is not a viable option because the company’s operations and investors are limited to one state. This leaves Regulation A and Regulation D as the remaining viable options.

Regulation D is preferable to Regulation A for several reasons. First, Regulation D is more cost-effective versus Regulation A because the offering documents do not have to be reviewed or qualified by the SEC. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D only requires the issuer to file Form D within 15 days after the sale of the security and the filing does not have to be qualified by the SEC. Furthermore, unlike Regulation A, Regulation D offerings under Rule 506 have no offering limit. As stated before, Regulation A is more geared towards growth companies while Regulation D is a better fit for start-ups. In this instance, the only benefits Regulation A has over Regulation D is that the offering is not limited to only accredited investors, and the resale of the securities is not limited.

Having narrowed down the exemptions to Regulation D, Rule 506(c) is the most preferable exemption in this situation. Unlike Rules 504 and 506(b), Rule 506(c) allows start-ups to advertise the offering without violating the exemption. Although Rule 504 does not limit the type of investors, there is an offering limit of $5 million, and state securities regulation is not preempted. Overall, Rule 506(c) is the most cost-effective exemption that allows start-ups to advertise its offering and reach its fundraising goals. The main limitations of Rule 506(c) offerings are that the investors must be accredited, and the resale of the security is restricted.

In recent discussion about TEVA, someone argued that Buffett didn't know about the original buy until after. I'd say doubling down signals confidence, and I doubt he'd be unaware of that move. I'm long TEVA for both the generics business and their potential in the migraine space. 

I'm also long DAL and happy to see Brk upping stake. I think DAL is best positioned to beat the other big carriers thanks to brand equity and superior customer experience \(including service and point system\).

3 - ancillary benefit of UPS drop off stores becoming Amazon drop offs/pick ups.
