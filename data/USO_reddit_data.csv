tgchzd_USO,USO,USO ETF & Oil Prices,"Hello Retards,

Just here to compare the price of oil per barrel to the share price of USO ETF. Based on oil's current price price per barrel, USO seems to be hugely undervalued. I know I am probably forgetting to factor in something, but it seems like USO should be trading at 2x it's current price. Below are some price comparisons: (Position - 100 commons and adding)

June 2014 - Oil $105 - USO $305

January 2020 - Oil $55 - USO $105

April 2020 - Oil (-$35) - USO $20

(On April 29, 2020, USO completed 1 for 8 reverse split)

May 2022 - Oil $100 - USO $75

Here are some shitty graphs for the smooth brains. I marked the highs and lows listed above.

Edit: I am not claiming this is a long term investment, but the oil market is in backwardation...

Implied volatility in the space also contracted slightly, with USO options pricing in about a 7% move this week vs the 9% last week.

Last week, we highlighted the extreme implied vol in energy and commodity-related names. USO, the United States Oil fund, was pricing about a 9% move for the week. It essentially made that move before the week even started as oil futures spiked Sunday and USO was up 8-9% pre-market on Monday. It reversed and by the end of the week actually finished lower, by about 4% on the week. Implied volatility in the space also contracted slightly, with USO options pricing in about a 7% move this week vs the 9% last week. USO IV remains high as its 30 day implied volatility is about 187% higher than its one-year realized volatility.

Some expected moves for the upcoming week: USO: 7%, XLE 4.2%, XOM: 4.2%, CVX: 4.2%, OXY, 7.6%, BTU: 12.4%, WEAT: 9.2%.

Even though IV cam in a bit in these names last week, they continue to show up on the High IV vs historical lists, with interest rate and currency-related ETFs also showing high IV vs historical:

galkk6_USO,USO,What Happened to USO and What Does Their Future Hold?,"**Wednesday, April 29, 2020**

Let's dig into what the US Oil Fund LP was and what will happen to it in the future after the collapse of oil prices.

In simplest terms, USO is a massive fund with a market cap of about $27 billion dollars, it mainly invests in Futures contracts that track the spot price of West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma. The fund buys the futures contracts for next month and then sells them before expiration because they do not take physical delivery, they only trade the contracts and use the profits to buy more contracts the next month. This makes them a great growth fund when the price of oil is rising predictably because they can make constant profits with relatively low risk.

**Oil's Collapse:**

[On 4\/20\/2020 the current month's futures contracts went negative.](https://preview.redd.it/1u1mg3nvpuv41.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=37650c8de22d5a58d2dc4fc7d9d827a430a71808)

4/20/20, the current month's contracts went negative due to them being dumped on the market with no buyers.

On the Morning of April 20th, 2020, the current Futures contracts went about $45 dollars to -$37 for a short period of time. This meant that if you purchased a single contract you would be paid $3,700 at expiration to take delivery of 1,000 barrels of crude oil from Cushing, OK. This was extremely important because those futures are what a majority of USO's value is based on. The contracts gain value over the course of the month, then are sold and new contracts are purchased the next month. However, with no demand for oil, the fund is left holding the bag on the contracts they can't sell. They lose value and expire worthless for the fund causing it to bleed money. A word you might have just recently heard because of this situation is Contango, which is a condition in which future months trade at a premium to the spot price and the nearby contract. When USO sells this month for a low price, and has to buy next months at a high price, that is where they lose money.

Right now, USO's price is being driven by both supply and demand for USO shares as well as the price of the underlying contracts. They filed with the SEC to register another 4 billion shares, but this has not become effective yet. They've also completed a 1 to 8 reverse split, bringing their price from $2.14 to about $18.00 to keep themselves from being delisted from the NYSE. They have also updated their prospectus and said that they plan to basically trade whatever contracts they would like in order to generate a profit.

**Future of USO:**

In the coming months, even if oil demand makes a strong comeback before the end of the year, it will be difficult for the fund to continue to exist unless they basically change everything they do and become something else with the same ticker, which is entirely possible but the chances that they do that before losing too much value and being liquidated are small. My advice is to stay away from USO, it is not a normal stock, when it loses 90% of it's value there is not the price pressure to push it back up like in a normal stock. It can just continue on a downtrend until it gets delisted and that is what I expect to happen.

**Edit:**

Must've fucked up when I posted this seems I cut off the section about some tips for trading oil.

\> Be patient, there's going to be a lot more pain in the oil industry and it's best to sit back and react to the shakeout.

\> Buy the big guys, there's going to be a lot of bankruptcies of smaller lower margin companies and the bigger companies with their massive balance sheets flush with cash will be able to buy their assets and wells at steep discounts.

\> XOM, CVX, BP,  and RDS.A a are all good places to start, they are likely to be long term winners in this situation.

\> If you want to trade the direct crude price I suggest WTI, biggest and most well known index.

Good luck.

Normally, there are shorts who are willing to take on long contracts from, say USO. However, as storage disappears, there won't be any shorts to take the long positions from USO as they try to roll them over to the next month. And the longs, which USO has taken on, are from producers who have every intention to deliver physical product. In the end, you may have extreme negative oil-future prices. What happens then? USO is shutdown, but then who is holding the bag and has to make up the loss? The brokerage? The exchange? The government? (that's my attempt at an explanation)

I'm a small retail investor, and I don't hold any USO. But I am concerned. What happens if an exchange is impacted, like Robinhood (I'm with Questrade in Canada)? What happens to all the retail investors in Robinhood?",2020-04-27,10,10

g7tr4i_INTU,INTU,Half joking: long INTU because of USO?,"There are now nearly 200,000 Robinhood accounts holding USO, not to mention all the other holdings of various oil products that are structured as partnerships (like DBO, UCO, USL and others.) That's at least nearly 200,000 people that will get a K-1 form (when you invest in a partnership you get a K-1) next year (K-1 printer go brrrr) and you have to pay for an upgraded Turbotax to enter that information.

When has there ever been this much retail interest/piling into products structured as partnerships? I can't recall. Additionally, while USO is having a reverse split, there was a massive amount of additional shares created recently: **""So, after an incredible orgy of share creation that increased USO’s shares outstanding to 1.449 billion yesterday from 156 million at the end of February.""** (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/04/22/a-plummeting-share-price-and-upcoming-reverse-split-show-that-uso-has-outlived-its-usefulness)

That's a lot of shares that retail investors were buying and how many accounts at RH or elsewhere were buying 10, 20, 30 shares? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/robinhood-traders-kept-flooding-into-biggest-oil-etf-during-rout. Earlier this week: ""On SoFi Invest — another trading platform used mostly by traders under 40 — USO was “by far” the highest-volume security on Tuesday and Wednesday."" https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/23/short-sellers-make-nearly-300-million-betting-against-retail-investors-favorite-oil-fund.html

So you have a massively increased share count, tremendous retail interest that is likely widely spread out among a significant retail base that we know includes at least nearly 200,000 users on RH (and that's just Robinhood - with that many shares and that much buying interest, how many accounts are now long an oil partnership fund - 750,000? 1M?) - all of whom will be getting a K-1 form, no matter how long they held.

Will some people go to an accountant? Sure. But a lot of people will use Turbotax and find that they have to upgrade next year. So, next year INTU will get at least a decent amount of added business because of all this USO ridiculousness.

I mean, this is sort of r/wsb-ish DD and part ""thinking out loud"" amusement, but there's perhaps something to it. 

TLDR: I think that INTU will next year be one thing that actually benefits from this USO ridiculousness.",2020-04-25,21,11

g7pixx_USO,USO,Why USO is trading at a premium?,"Why USO is trading at a premium? Does it mean it will come down soon.

Edit: Here's my thought in more detail:

Now USO is trading at a 6% premium.

If SEC approves new creation baskets, bang! premium drop to 0. If oil price stay the same as now, that's a 6% instant drop guaranteed. Everyone holding USO should be selling now to avoid getting further crashed. But this is not happening. Why?

The only possible reason I can think of:

1. Short recover.
2. Dumb money coming in. (Everyone should be scared by now, right?)
3. SEC won't approve new creation baskets soon, by the time it approves, oil price will go up at least 6% to offset the premium.

If it is case 3, won't the best play be short USO and long the underlining future contract, and pocket that 6% profit, typical arbitrage.

If it is case 1, still the best play is not to recover the shorts now, but buying the underlining assets. (Well, maybe they are already doing it, and that's why the oil price went up a bit these few days, but why the gap is not closed yet?)

So it must be case 2, those dumb money see oil going up and dump in USO without think whether it is traded at premium or discount. The best play here is to short USO, and hedge with futures, right?

tldr, there's a market inefficiency here, and I don't understand why it hasn't been rectified yet. Why not Short USO, long CLN20 & CLQ20? 

If I can see it, everyone else can see it, certainly the big guys. Then why it is not done yet, there must be a catch that I missed, what is it?",2020-04-25,3,6

g6zkc1_USO,USO,"A Smooth-Brained's Guide To Oil, Futures, and USO","I've been seeing a lot of comments recently from smooth brains buying USO LEAPS and clearly not understanding how oil futures work or what USO actually consists of. Although I thought this was common knowledge, like apparently the DD I posted [last week about why $DB is fucked,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g58rkl/deutsche_bank_on_the_brink_of_insolvency/) some people apparently don't understand how any of this works. So today in Fun with Fundementals™, I've decided to make a guide to explain what I hope is already obvious to 95% of you for the 5% of readers that still think buying long-dated USO calls is a good idea.

**The Oil Market**

When I write ""Oil"" here, I'm specifically talking about Crude Oil. This is the dinosaur juice that gets pumped out of the ground, but is also very useless until it is refined. Crude Oil is then used to make a variety of random shit, most notably petrol and jet fuel, but also for things like plastic, paint, fertilizers. To prevent oil producers from literally watering down their products when selling them, what ""Crude Oil"" is chemically is standardized so refiners know exactly what they're buying. Similar to measuring things, there's basically only two standards that people care about - WTI, which is used in the US, and Brent, which is used in basically every other country in the world. We're going to be talking about WTI Oil.

**Oil Futures**

It takes a massive amount of capital expenditure and transportation to produce and deliver Crude Oil. To help hedge against price fluctuations, someone came up with the idea of selling their future oil so they have the confidence that there will be a buyer after they put in all the investment drilling and moving it, and so the futures contract was invented. Actually, futures contract was invented centuries before oil started trading, and is used for just about any commodity (except for onions, because it's literally illegal) like pigs and wheat. A futures contract is a contract obliging for the writer to deliver a set quantity of the commodity to the holder at a particular price at a specific date. These contracts could then be traded around up until the expiration date.

For WTI futures, it is a contractual agreement to deliver to the holder 1000 barrel of WTI at some specific date in Cushing, Oklahoma to a storage facility or pipeline. As many speculators also found out this week, it's also apparently a contractual obligation for the contract holder to take delivery of that amount of oil, leaving many bag holders to find themselves with May WTI contracts that now have a negative price as traders panic once they realize they had to take physical delivery of oil. WTI in particular was extra fucked because some genius decided to have the official delivery place of the oil contract in the middle of the continent far away from the oceans, making it impossible to bring it to a tanker ship to bring it somewhere else.

There's also different futures contracts for WTI oil for different months which may have different prices, so a price of oil in June can be cheaper or more expensive than the price of oil in July. When the price of a futures contract is more expensive the further out the date is, it's called contango, which is where oil futures are right now.

**USO**

Now that we've covered oil and its derivative, oil futures, let's talk about USO, an ETF that acts as the derivative of the derivative of WTI oil. Up until very recently, it tracked the price of the front month futures contract until 2 weeks before expiry, since they can't actually take delivery of oil as an ETF. After seeing May contracts go negative as well as a massive amount of retail investment money coming in causing them to hold more than 25% of front month contracts, USO decided to restructure to now hold futures of multiple months (as of right now they hold June, July, Aug, and Sept contracts).

So, every month USO will need to sell most of their contracts to buy contracts 1 more month in advance. For example, if they want to hold 50% of their assets in contracts for 2 months in the future (i.e. July), in a few weeks they will need to sell most of those July contracts and use that money to buy more August contracts. Since we are in contango, this means that those August contracts will be more expensive than the July contracts that got sold. This results in the amount of oil futures that 1 share of USO will hold will go down over time. Another way you can think about this is that the premium between the August and July contract is the price of storing a barrel of oil somewhere for a month, since you could hypothetically just sell a contract for July and buy an August contract if you wanted to find a place to store your oil between those months. USO is basically continuously devaluing because it needs to pay to store all the oil it is holding in futures. As the price of an ETF usually\* closely tracks the NAV due to arbitrage from creations and redemptions, this also means there will be downwards pressure on the price of USO over time, sort of like Theta in your SPY puts.

\*A few days ago, due to some SEC bureaucracy, this is no longer true temporarily for USO, and the NAV differed from the price by over 36%. I talked more about this in my [previous post about USO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5smyo/weird_stuff_going_on_with_uso/) and how you could have taken advantage of it, if you're curious.

This means that holding USO over the long term, or buying USO LEAP calls, is a bad idea unless you expect oil to absolutely skyrocket the next few months. On the other side, this also means that if you don't think that it will skyrocket, USO LEAP puts might print even if oil futures moves sideways or recovers slowly, as long as it remains in contango. Also, at this point you're literally buying the derivative of a derivative of a derivative of the price of oil, so the effect of the price of an actual barrel of an oil here isn't going to matter that much anymore.

TLDR; You're still smooth brained if you still think holding USO or long-dated USO calls long term is a good idea, and maybe buy USO LEAP puts or better yet sell USO LEAP calls to have theta on your side if you think we're not going to recover anytime soon

EDIT - PS: There's still a 9% NAV premium on USO",2020-04-24,116,34
g7jjot_USO,USO,Questions about USO,"\*\*tldr\*\*

  1.) How much liquidity does USO have?

  2.) How much of said liquidity gets drained in May? 

  3.) How much would be drained if the June contracts remain at $17.00?

4.) Is an ETF like USO eligible for any stimulus?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  Hey guys, I am one of the many people who bought USO put options in the days leading up to the WTI crash. However, a few days ago, I decided to buy USO calls for 2022. Only 200$ worth.

&#x200B;

  Anyways, I started to realize today that I didnt really know much about USO as I should, so I did some research, and I cant understand these price sheets.

&#x200B;

  For example: If oil were to remain at \~17.00$ for 6 months, would they recover? I dont want opinions, I would like to know the math.

&#x200B;

  I think the math would help me and a lot of people here on r/stocks get clarity and stop a large amount of the guessing regarding where this stock will be in the coming years. If someone could answer, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

g574dx_USO,USO,The Mango Contango - Or: why you should probably avoid $USO,"*Disclaimer: I posted this earlier today in the daily thread, but still seeing a ton of questions like ""can anyone tell me why USO LEAPs are not guaranteed money right now?"" and others along those lines. So I'm going to repost it here for your benefit. Keep in mind, it's a very dumbed down analogy.* 

If you are considering USO, please understand 

#The Mango Contango:

- You are looking to buy mangoes next month. You have $100, and each mango futures contract is $10. You now have 10 mangoes you plan on buying, congratulations. 

- The month is about to roll over, and you realize ""shit I don't need these mangoes right now! I will next month, though!"" Bad news! Your contracts have gone down by $1, and are now worth $9, so you sell them to some fool for $90. Shame, you lost $10, but you're sure it'll bounce back.

- Well! Good news, or so you think... The contracts for the following months are actually worth $15 because there's expected to be a shortage! However, you only have $90 now... so you can only buy 6 contracts this time.

- You decide to hold on and see if you can make your money back. You wait another month. You were right! The mangoes futures for the *next* month have gone up EVEN FURTHER! $20! However, because you only hold 6 contracts now, you are actually only up $20 total, even though mangoes are DOUBLE what you originally bought the contracts for.

This is the mango contango. And this is how contango fucks your ass in USO. Enjoy!

**IN ADDITION**: If every single month going forward has more expensive contracts (i.e., if the price of oil keeps going up *GRADUALLY*), you will most likely lose money EVEN IF oil is more than it was the day you got into USO. In order to reverse this trend and actually profit, oil would need to absolutely skyrocket in the middle of one of the current contracts. So you're pretty much gambling on a big maybe happening.

TL;DR - USO is not your buddy, pal.",2020-04-21,101,28
g5o4zk_USO,USO,USO -> Gone by End of May or Ban,"I'm tired of this... It has to stop. USO is completely broken. If I were cheating, I'd say that USO is already gone. They changed their distribution of futures contracts, and they no longer ""semi-accurately"" track spot oil prices. TastyTrade had a video in youtube which is short, explains the fund and contango, and should be mandatory watching before Robinhood lets you yolo your life savings on such a shit fund. After today, and their near capitulation, I wanted to put it out there for all the WSB community, that the time has come. USO->0. 

1. We have never had a situation like this. Enormous supply, demand gone + landlocked distribution = pay someone to take this shit off my hands 
2. Negative oil prices, and not in some tar sands field in Canada, present a new risk that was not properly planned for - USO will liquidate long before that, but the bottom just got moved down 40$ and that's scary. 
3. Retail investors screaming to get in. Volume is making the issues much worse. As volume of the fund has exploded over the past weeks, they have grown and grown in % of Futures contracts owned. Rolling forward their futures contracts is massive, disruptive, and expensive. 
4. The fund is dislocated from its NAV price, and that might only grow worse over the next weeks. No new shares are being issued right now, so Everytime some CNBCer wants a piece of USO, Pressure builds.

If you are thinking of buying shares of USO, get the hell out of here. If you think there will be a short squeeze in the next days or week term? Try and time it, be my guest. But this fund has been picking up steam downhill for a while, and the time has come that it's over. Do the math, buy FD puts, and watch it burn.",2020-04-21,22,41
g5jxa7_USO,USO,USO - losing my hat today - gameplan?,"*edit: there is already so much negativity in the comments. “You’re stupid bro haha better research next time”. There is a reason that the stock market is people’s career, it’s complex and has millions of variations and possible outcomes - so before tooting your horn to playground name-calling. How about let’s make a productive online community where thoughtful questions are explained so that everyone can learn. Thanks :)*

**edit 2: so what I’ve learned so far is that USO buys oil contracts at X price, and they try to sell that contract for a bit more once the oil has hit American soil. They buy several months out, and since oil prices have been nose-diving, this fund is committed to several months of losses. Everyone assumes that this fund will be liquidated and that is the inherent risk, that is why everyone is selling their shares in the fund, and that’s why the price is tanking. If you assume that they will not be liquidated, this stock price should begin to climb once normal flows of profitable contracts continue. When will that happen, we are unsure, but the next update will be on 5/19**

*edit 3: I sold 75% of my placement at a 27% loss, leaving the 25% in there for shits n gigs if we go to war soon* 

Hey Everyone,

Last week I looked at getting a placement in oil, and seeing as I’m a risk-adverse person I deduced that a fund in oil USO would probably give me what I was looking for.

Come this week and USO is tanking and I read a lot last night about how it’s a commodity fund and it’s based on futures and blah blah. And basically it’s not a typical stock. I’m doing my best to understand what I’ve read but I’m struggling.

My plan is to hold my positions for 2 years and then get out when I’ve either 2-3x’d my money or the two years is up. 

So considering that I don’t mind keeping my positions at a loss for an extended period, should I even worry about my USO placement? 

Based on the fact that oil isn’t going anywhere in the immediate future, it surely will go back up when oil prices and the oil surpluses go to a somewhat normal patter right? 

Can someone help explain USO pricing to me WITHOUT using any stock vocabulary terms. 

Thanks in advance!

Long time lurker, first time shitposter.

Oil was trading below $0.50 for May 2020 WTI futures today.
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-oils-may-contract-skids-about-20-at-nadir-as-crudes-woes-continue-2020-04-19?mod=home-page
USO is one of the more common ETFs to trade on oil futures. They usually hold 100% of their funds in WTI futures for the following month.  They hold these and then begin to sell/roll them into the following months futures contract starting 2 weeks before the strike date.  For example they sold all of their May 2020  futures between april 7th-13th and then rolled those into June 2020 futures. http://www.uscfinvestments.com/resources-filings/commodities/uso

This means that USO spent nearly $26-30 to buy June futures contracts. These contracts are selling for around $22 today 4/20.  Once the May contract is up tomorrow this is where everyone will begin speculating.  The oil storage capacity is almost full at this very moment and demand is not expected to appreciate soon.   Also the fact that 7 massive Saudi tankers whose oil is already purhcased will be coming into the gulf. These tankers have 14 million barrels of oil or more than 7 times the amount Saudi delivered to us in March. 
 The demand is gone.The supply is overwhelming. the storage is gone. Price of these futures will have to dump
.https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/supertanker-delivery-surge-saudi-crude-oil-armada-heads-200408142443637.html

I know someone is going to bring up the fact that USO changed their investment strategy recently allowing them to hold up to 20% of their investments in the 2nd following month contracts (July) this will only slightly curb the massacre. 
 If anything this show how worried they are.https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/biggest-oil-etf-shakes-structure?nopaging=1

My sense is that $11 a barrel is egreigiously unsustainable and will greatly damage the industry in the US and abroad.

g4y84r_USO,USO,Don’t buy USO (DD inside),"Buying these oil etf's is very risky and largely misunderstood. Even with record inflows approaching $1.8 Billion dollars at the end of March, A savvy investor (or autist) should spend their money elsewhere. USO is designed for short term investors who constantly monitor sweet crude to swing trade. The fund holds short-term futures on WTI crude (NYMEX).

Right now the fund is experiencing contango because the current oil futures are priced lower than future months, meaning profits are eaten away for long term investors. As West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall 50% and oil volatility explodes more than 200%, I strongly recommend to anyone looking for a good place to park money for the long term to avoid USO.

If you happen to be a trader with a substantial physical oil repository, you could place spreads betting on contago increasing and generate a healthy return. An individual controlling physical oil with storage can sell futures contracts for delivery at say $65, and then sit on the physical oil for a couple month to realize healthy gains.

Alternatively, you could short a closer spot month's contract and buy a further out months securing profit if the market increases its contago structure (praying there isn't any backwardation). Unfortunately for this hypothetical individual, oil and other commodities are subject to this because short-term supply scares tend to drive UP the spot month price. With the fights between the Middle East and Russia heating up combined with existing political instability, personally I'd avoid the subject in its entirety.

You can very easily lose money even if oil goes past $40. Usually the roll premium for oil futures (what these etf's need to use) is around 20 cents, however it is near 6 dollars right now. If this continues even for a few months and you get into oil at $10 per barrel, you can easily end up losing money even when the price inevitably rises up again.

As you can clearly see, the bottom touched at 4.29. Individuals began testing it to see whether it would curl up or not, and it did with support levels 4.29 - 4.64 (very fair). The gap has a nice window at $10, which in my honest opinion huge window opportunity.

Saudi Arabia's Aramco is now a publicly traded company. They are tanking the price of oil by flooding the market until a new deal is reached.

Hoping some one may be able to give me an idea of what to expect here as I was unaware that USO is setup as a LP and reported as a partnership for tax purposes with K-1 schedules

I was reading that some folks that have held or traded this fund have had ""tax surprises"" at the end of the year due to reporting their share of the fund's income albeit on much larger positions than the puny one that I had on.

I had a minimal interest (5 shares @ total 60.00 cost basis) but I as I read more about it, I got spooked and sold out of the position.

I am just wondering what may be the tax implications here from someone that has held this position long-term? 

I hope that I won't have to owe a few thousand in taxes for a $60 position.

Sorry if this sounds silly, I am really just trying to clarify as most information that I have read online says to consult a tax accountant, but I'm trying to get an idea of this allocate will be material or if I am just stressing out for nothing.

So with this crazy year coming to a close and the markets bouncing every which way, I thought I'd give a more visual representation in why I remain bullish for oil. 

See my graphs [here](https://m.imgur.com/VfuqjKq)

The left y axis represents EIA crude inventory numbers (blue bars on graph) with the right y axis being the price of WTI crude (orange lines on graph).

As you can see, for the most part, price per barrel shares an inverse relationship to crude inventory amount ( econ 101: supply and demand, amount goes up price goes down and vice versa ). Leading up to the meeting to the OPEC meeting in Algeria on 9/23/2018 , we saw WTI crude inventories reach some of the lowest levels in years. This was largely a result of South Korea and Japan stopping all their oil shipments from Iran, and instead bought from US oil producers. 

The conclusion from the OPEC meeting in Algeria was that markets were adequately supplied and did not require an immediate boost in production (beyond what was already agreed upon due to countries  overcomplying with supply cuts by about 500,000 barrels per day). This was the moment wallstreeters started sucking their own dick calling for $100 a barrel of oil. Notice how price and supply  from 9/21 to 10/05 were no longer inverse to one another and actually show a correlation. Yeahhhhhh so basically this was the moment the market said ""fuck fundementals, we're in speculation mode now!"" I believe the week of Oct 5 saw a massive spikes in long positions opened ( a 50% increase from the week before with a ratio of 13 longs: 1 short). It was at this point the trend started to reverse.

In the middle of October, Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to increase production in anticipation of the  Iranian Sanctions  that were suppose to be implemented in November. At this point Russia, SA, and the US were producing at record levels, well we all know what happened next. Donald Trump pulled a fast one and decided to offer  oil waivers to a bunch of countries. So with the combined historic production levels of russia, the US, and SA on top of the new waivers, WTI crude saw 11 weeks of builds resulting in the nose dive in prices/current bear market.

It wasn't until 12/7/2018 that we saw our first crude draw of 7.8 million barrels. It was at this point that OPEC decided to change course and annouced they would be reimplementing production cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day, essentially sending production levels back to what they were at before Iranian Sanctions were even annouced. Although, the cuts wouldn't come into effect until Jan 2019, Saudi Arabia already took steps at stabilizing prices by drastically decreasing exports to the US. The EIA reports from Dec 7 - Dec 28 reflects this decrease and is a large reason we haven't seen a crude build  since the end of November. Notice how crude inventory levels have been relatively stable in December and yet we have seen an additional 12-15% drop. This has largely been more of a reflection of the negative global economic outlook for most markets and not a representation of current oil fundementals. The fact the the oil market is largely balanced right now without OPEC supply cuts yet on top of possible progress being made with the China trade war is the reason I'm sticking with my guns and remaining an oil bull. I've never done this before with oil..... but I'm thinking about buying 12.0 USO calls 2 months out (Feb 15)

With that being said, Happy New Year Wallstreetbets! May 2019 be filled with tendies for you and your loved ones.


Edit: Also keep in mind, Donald Trump offered waivers for 180 days, meaning the market will have to deal with Iranian Sanctions again by the second quarter

9sjhuy_USO,USO,Quick and Dirty USO DD: Oct 29 - Nov 2,"Alright super fast, quick and dirty DD for USO.

*What happened last week GeoDudeBroMan?*

Rolling selloffs in the equities market caused by global trade tensions and higher interest rates had a big effect on oil prices last week. 

Global economy bad ----> demand goes down  


EIA report came in showing a 6 million barrel crude build and a 4.8 million barrel gas draw last week (added some volatility to the report as traders digested the news).

*What is happening this week GeoDudeBroMan?*

The selloff saga continues with our Cheeto in Chief likely going to go full retard on China with 100% tariffs.

Genscape came in saying they expect to see a 1.7 million barrel crude build at the Cushings oil hub. Rig count suggests higher production and is likely leading to pipeline bottlenecks, hence the builds at cushings.

USO has also shifted from backwardian trading, future prices moving towards spot price, to contango, or when futures price is above the expected spot price. This means futures prices are falling over time to converge to the future spot price. This usually indicates a supply glut in the oil market (supply exceeds demand).

WTI Crude could go to $64.5x if everything a lines perfectly for the bears which would be $13.5x USO. Now with that being said, to get 13.5p FDs is SUPER risky, Iranian Sanctions still right around the corner, Nov 5, so that will offer at least some support for bulls.

My suggestion is 14.0p FDs or 13.5p for Nov 9.

Be careful out there guys, market has been choppy as hell. Good luck

Edit: API reporting a 5.6m build but also saying a gas and distillates draw. As I always say, it doesn't mean anything until EIA confirms

Edit: EIA basically confirmed API estimate for gas and distillates , we still saw a crude build so this report is kind of a mixed bag again",2018-10-30,35,47
9qi9q8_USO,USO,USO DD for the Week of Oct 22-26,"Hey everyone, I decided to wait a little longer before posting the DD for this week because theta is a bitch and you guys deserve some cheap FDs. So with that being said let's first talk about last week.

So something that I didn't anticipate last week when I posted my DD was the fact that Michael actually had a significant impact on oil exports from the Gulf of Mexico and was a large reason for the huge build last week. Additionally, while exports were being hindered in the Gulf, imports were able to make their way to the US through different terminals which also added to the build last week. That being said, the storm did lower production rates and refinery utilization rates were up slightly, but ultimately they were not significant enough to offset the decrease in oil exports/continued imports. So let's talk about this week.

Saudi's have made clear multiple times that they would not weaponize oil production regardless of how current events have been unfolding. The market is largely ignoring this news so we can assume it won't have a significant impact on prices this week and can focus more on supply and demand fundementals.

Based on preliminary shipping data I've been looking at, exports are down somewhere between 400k-700k bpd from last week which would favor a crude build. We are still in the middle of refinery maintenance season and the lower refinery utilization rate will also add to the likely hood of a build as well. From an analyst standpoint, bloomberg is expecting to see another crude build this week as well, they are better than API, but not as good as genscape. Hedge funds have also significantly reduced their long positions as well suggesting the bullish bias Iranian sanctions brought is starting to fade (long to short ratio went from 14:1 to 8:1), big money is likely looking towards the downside.

I'll be getting 14.5 puts FD, if you guys buy anything else that's on you, 14.5p is the safer bet though. 

Update 10/23/18: API report is in and they are estimating a 9.8 million barrel build. Every analyst is basically expecting a build, so if EIA confirms, hold on to your butts lol

Update 10/24/18: crude build confirmed at 6.8 million barrels, but larger than expect gas draw at 4.8 million. Bulls choosing to ignore the build and only focusing on the draw so I'm not sure how low we will actually go. There is no oil god! Lol",2018-10-22,64,122

Current stock Price is at 9.27

1. Sell 10 PUT option at strike price 16 for JAN 18.
2. Buy 5 CALL option at strike price 7 for JAN 18.

For a -10% move, i will loose 328.67 USD for JAN 18
For a +10% move, i will make 227.45 USD for JAN 18

Any thoughts ?",2016-01-24,3,19

41kmee_USO,USO,Buying distant calls on USO a good option for going long oil?,"Hi, newish option trader. I suspect the oil bulls will be eventually right and we will make it back to $50 a barrel, but I believe their timing is off, and that it's going to take until 2017 to do so.

Therefore, I am considering buying January 2018 calls on USO. My current target for a strike price is $13, as looking at charts, that's roughly where USO was in 2015 when oil was $50 a barrel. Any flaws in my strategy, or perhaps something else I should buy calls on instead? I also assume, of course, that I should hold out as long as I can for time decay reasons and the bottoming of oil prices.

Thank you in advance for your input.",2016-01-18,4,15

40jnfb_USO,USO,Long Jan '18 $USO Calls,"Is anyone else getting ready to buy some long-term calls for $USO? We saw another large drop in WTI today, nearly hitting $32. I'm not another ""oil MUST have bottomed out by NOW"" type of investors, but I don't believe OPEC will be driving down the price two years from now. I'd be willing to speculate a few thousand dollars on the fact that enough US shale producers will collapse as the price of crude lowers, and OPEC will be satisfied and cut production over time. Even if reserves are relatively full, investors will get back into oil and boost the price to over my break even.


Now, I'm not going to rush in tomorrow at open; nothing like that. I'm going to still wait for oil to *hopefully* creep a bit lower so that I can get a better price. I have no real target, as I can only speculate, but if the world markets keep sliding as they have been we may see oil driving much lower in the mean time.


Any opinions? Sorry if the whole oil situation is overdone on the internet these days.",2016-01-11,3,24
