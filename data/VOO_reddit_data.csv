1ky1j1w_VOO,VOO,Is real estate a way better ROI than stocks like VOO in the long run?,"So I’ve always been a big advocate for stocks and ETFs like VOO because of how hands-off they are. Set it and forget it, right? Super passive compared to managing a rental.

But recently I’ve been rethinking things. I bought a $250k condo a while back and rent it out for about $2,000/month. After accounting for mortgage (3%, 30 year fixed), insurance, taxes, and maintenance, I’m left with about $4k in profit a year. On top of that, just by paying the mortgage, I’m building around $4,200 in equity annually. Plus, the property value is appreciating at around 2–3% a year, let’s say $5k conservatively.

That’s around $13k/year in combined cash flow and equity gains.

Since I put $50k down (20%), that’s a 26% return on investment. Compare that to something like VOO, which historically returns around 10% a year.

So now I’m wondering… am I missing something here? Is real estate just a way better ROI over time if you buy smart and manage it well? Or is there a hidden downside I’m not accounting for? 

Curious what others think.",2025-05-29,0,42

1kvy5bd_META,META,"What’s the argument for investing in the S&P500 (ex. VOO), instead of investing directly in the MAG7","Basically title.

Over the past 5 years, companies like GOOGL, META, MSFT, AVGO and NVDA have significantly outperformed both QQQ and VOO.

GOOGL/META/MSFT had their stock prices increase by 130%-160%. AVGO 700% and NVDA 1300%.

In comparison, QQQ increased by 117%, and VOO by 91%. 

I understand that their rate of growth is unlikely to continue at those levels, but those companies are also still attractive, with wide moats, lots of cash, growth potential, etc.

Couldn’t you just buy those 5 stocks and then keep an eye out for “up and comers” (as in, companies who’s market cap is steadily increasing, and that also have attractive balance sheets and growth metrics), and buy them as they start to rise up?

I would love to hear other’s opinions on this.

Would you keep both or one and which one?
If you would keep both what would be the percentages of each?

I don't know if you all feel the same way, but today's price action was brutal. There was no clear trend, and both calls and puts were smashed in early trading.

What surprised me was how well one of my setups held up even in such a noisy environment. I wasn't expecting much, but sticking with the idea made all the difference.

I am interested in getting into investing and wanted to know if it would be better to start off with buying SCHD or VOO. SCHD is cheaper by a long-shot, but is it worth it in the short or long term?

Also, for those who do invest in SCHD, can I ask how many shares you have, the time it took for you to get to that number, and when you feel most comfortable selling? Thank you!",2025-04-12,88,70

A good part of our family savings is there and I don't see any reasons or need to panic and sell because we just don't need it for now. However, I had been thinking for the last couple of weeks about buying a bear put spread (SPY for better liquidity) and never pushed the buy button which obviously has been a painful and expensive doubt after the last days.

If I wrote 3 put contracts for $465 VOO 19th December 2025 at 33.00. 

I would get about 10k for the sale of the contracts, and my max risk would be owning 300 shares of VOO at 465 so roughly $140k less the 10k I received in premium.

1jqwfp5_PATH,PATH,Question on VOO Only Roth,"Question... so in November I sold my home and decided to open a Roth and put the max contribution all in VOO at one time. Im new to this and thought I was making a good move, and didn't know anything about DCAing. Im still a long ways off from retirement (about 20 years)...but with the Trump Tariffs I saw myself lose $650  of that $7K today. 

I know this isn't a huge loss compared to others but I guess my question is... would it be better to take the remainder out of VOO with all this uncertainty right now and go into something more stable? 

To clarify, I dont mean out of the Roth account entirely and realize the loss... but move to a different investment for now... 

OR... should I DCA VOO while its on sale (and continues to drop)? 

The problem with DCAing right now for me is I can only contribute like $50 or $100 every 2 weeks (per pay period) so I dont know how much of a dent its going to make while all of this is going on.

1jpz6jg_VOO,VOO,Roth IRA VOO investing after maxed 401k,"I’m 32 years old working for an airline that contributes 17% of my salary into a 401k regardless of whether or not I contribute at all (not a match).

I contribute 11% of my salary into my 401k in addition to the 17% my company contributes. Right now I make about $200,000 a year which will steadily climb to $500,000 a year in the next 5 or so years. So that comes to about $56,000 a year into my 401k this year and it’ll climb until it’s maxed out and at the point the excess will in automatically invested into a market based cash balance plan. I got a bit of a late start to my restaurant. So I have about $70,000 in my 401k right now and $3,000 in an old Roth IRA that I only recently started to contribute to.

My question is; if I have an extra $500 or so a month to invest is it reasonable to just purchase about 1 share or VOO each month in my Roth IRA which would be close to maxing it out by the end of each year.

Just like the tittle says, I am concerned about the current market valuations and I see Berkshire as a better value play because of the amount of cash they hold and their conservative approach. (be greedy when other are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy). 

Berkshire did pretty well in the 2022 correction as well and I see them as a good value play.  BRK's cash reserves and diversified portfolio make it a pretty safe bet during downturns in my opinion.

1hnfm97_VOO,VOO,Pay down mortgage? Or VOO/HYSA,"Hi All

We bought/sold our primary home the last 3-months. 

We are currently carrying a pretty high balance on our mortgage with the plan to recast now that we have funds from our sale. Our monthly payment is of course mostly interest but it's doable with our current income. 

I've gotten very different opinions on this, so here I go to the Reddit Wild West. 

Options: 

Better to recast our mortgage 5.99% (low fee to recast) to get this to a much lower monthly payment. 

Or, put into the market/VOO or even a HYSA?

If our money doesn't do better than 5.99% in the market (which who the hell knows in this current state) wouldn't it best to just pay down the mortgage? 

We will need to lower our mortgage payment in approximately 2-years when my career changes and my earnings dip temporarily.

With this in mind would it make sense to sell out of the money covered calls?

Basically sell December 2025 covered calls that have a strike price 10% higher than the current price. That will pay out about a 3.5% premium.


If the market goes down I out perform the market by at least 3.5%. Then I can use the premium to buy shares at a depressed price.

If the market goes up less than 13.5% I still outperform the market.

I only lose if the market goes up over 13.5%. Not the best but at least I got a nice return. 

With more volatile investments like QQQ or individual stocks you can higher premiums and higher strike prices.

QQQ - strike price 15% higher than current price. Premium is 4.5%. Basically the only way you lose is if the QQQ goes up more than 20%

Does this strategy make sense?

I would think the majority of years you would win out. Especially if it’s something like QQQ. How many years does it go up over 20%? How many years does it go down or go up less than 20%? I’d say at least 70% of the time you will win.

And even if you ‘lose’ you could roll the options one year into the future and you won’t have to sell your shares

I also have 20k in VOO that is already up $600+ in the last 2 weeks. That’s half of what my 12 month CD is offering. 

Emergency Fund - 10k in Fidelity Spaxx.
I found out about fidelity after the fact. I’m very new to all this.

I am aware that nothing is guaranteed with fidelity and any other firms except what is locked in with my 12month CD.

I would take the lost for the early withdrawal for a better chance with VOO and SCHD. Long term ofc.

Why should I do this or why should I not?

If I went ahead how would u advise on investing that 30k between both voo&schd? 

I want to expand my portfolio with dividend income stocks. SCHD would be my first high dividend fund.

The top 7 portfolio has about a .64% dividend yield (probably less actually because I have SCHD and DGRO in there for dividends) compared to VOO’s yield of 1.31%. Is the higher volatility worth the lower yield? By sacrificing dividends am I stunting the compounding effects? Am I totally lost?!

Short term investments easy to understand, you buy and holds for a certain period of time and whenever you feel like your wining, sell.

Day trading easier to get and lose money because the amount of money your playing with needs no be higher in order to make it profitable and you never know what’s the market gonna do.

LONG TERM INVESTMENTS this is what I don’t get, let me elaborate before you make conclusions.

Okay I understand the c0mp0und (had to write like that or remove for spam ) effect and I know how brilliant it can be over time, I buy VOO shares, they give me dividends, share’s price go up, reinvest next year and so on for 5 years.

But everyone here knows that 5 years it ain’t nothing, if you want to make actual profits you’ll need to hold that shares for at least 20 years or 30 years or even more than that!

And here’s the problem, more than 20 years it’s enough time for something else to happen, what if a world war begins?

What if rich people decide that VOO doesn’t matter for them anymore make an announcement saying that old this time it was bullshit and nothing more? 

What If USA go to s*ht and S&P500 with them ? 

I mean 30 f*cking years it’s a lot of time and enough time for a catastrophe to happen, so I may being radically crazy but I just feel like trusting rich people your money for that long isn’t that good anymore, it might’ve been but I don’t think it’s a good idea to trust them now.

1et9kdm_VTI,VTI,VMFXX vs VOO or VTI for passive income?,"So im 24(tomorrow) and i just recently got a new job paying a good amount more with overtime available, so i set up a Roth IRA with vanguard at the advice of my friend. Im still super new but have been doing a lot of research.

I mainly set up this Roth IRA for a retirement fund with the hopes of just making consistent passive income, i do not want to aggressively invest. I have $100 in VMFXX at the moment and don’t plan on putting anymore in until my new checks start hitting. Once i get a little more money pooling in i plan on putting a good chunk of it into my Roth IRA though.

My buddy has had one for 5 years and hes only put money into VMFXX, hes made some solid profit so im tempted to just invest into that, but i was wondering if it’d be smarter to invest into an ETF like voo or vti? Would i generally make more money with that, and if so how much riskier would it be? Im trying to figure out what my best course of action would be to make decent passive income with relatively low risk.

Long story short I've accumulated some extra income which mainly sits in my account gaining decent interest but I'm debating taking a chunk of this and moving it into Voo and possibly other dividend paying stocks. I think popular consensus is put it all on Voo but my only thoughts are that the market has possibly just started a dip (I think September is historically a bad month... plus possible cuts etc). I know timing the market is not going to work but its hard to ignore so many indicators and current global crashes. So I'm debating if I stick to high interest deposits (which may not stay high...), go for the stocks now and stop overthinking or go for the stocks in a couple months.  
  
Alternative plan is to dollar cost average which has its advantages but obviously would take more time to build . Sorry I'm a bit of a novice so would appreciate any guidance.

When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?

To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right?

18sidrn_SPY,SPY,"I Own SPY and VOO, is Holding Both a Setback or Should I Hold Both?",I’m a long term investor and plan on owning either or the two for years to come. From what I’ve seen spy has a higher expense ratio than voo which questions the need to hold both since they both seemingly perform the same. I’m also aware if I sell spy I’ll have to pay taxes on my capital appreciation which could strip some of the reinvestment into voo. For these reasons I’m curious as to if I should sell one of the two or hold both. Thank you,2023-12-28,0,5

I’m looking at a long term horizon of 20-25 years, i’m curious to hear what you all think about committing to VOOG instead of VOO. Both in Roth IRA and taxable brokerage. 

According to Vanguard website 
VOOG annualized returns since inception before taxes: 14.45%,
VOO annualized returns since inception before taxes: 13.19%

VOOG is more volatile, but i’m thinking that shouldn’t matter all that much if looking into 20+ year returns, right? I see myself as having a very high risk tolerance since I’m single, no kids, super stable job, no debt, and pretty low expenses.

Also, VOOG has a dividend yield roughly .5% lower, so in a taxable account it should produce less tax drag.

The only negative i’m seeing is the ER, but it’s only a difference of .07%.

But there ARE people who are good at picking stocks, and it’s NOT that hard, and people should be trying to learn from them, not settle for a market return. There was a great post of DD here a few weeks ago on Duolingo, with an investment thesis and a discounted cash flow model. The stock is up 20% since that post. That kind of post should be encouraged. I pick my own stocks. I have winners and losers. I learn from each, and each makes me a better trader and investor. I devote a few hours a week to research, and an hour or so each morning making any trading decisions. 

I won’t deny that there are many people who don’t have the time or brainpower to devote to researching individual companies, listening to earnings calls, and keeping up with evaluating them over time. For those, buying an ETF and investing passively is the way to go. My understanding is that that is not what this sub is for.

Been a lurker on this sub for a while and really have gained so much insight from all of you on my investing journey, so shout out to you guys!

I am 27 and have a generally pretty boring portfolio with splits as follows:

1) VOO - 45%

2) VT - 40%

3) Individual stocks - 10% (lot of EV stocks since i have passion for them (especially rivian), as well as holdovers like GE, amazon, disney from investing prior to committing everything to ETFs)

4) DRIV - 5% (again, electric car nut, know its redundant, but nice to have a lot of the EV market outside of RIVN in an ETF, even if it is pretty top heavy with Google, etc.)

Know the overlap between VOO and VT, but when I started investing in ETFs, I was exclusively buying VOO. As I learned more, found out that I liked some exposure to international and small caps, but not enough to VT and chill lol. 

Recently, I have been having a strong desire to be more aggressive. I dont know if I am just falling into the trap of wanting to stray from ""boring"" investing, and end up shooting myself in the foot.

Looking to put 50% of my portfolio into one or two of these ETFs. I want to get everyones opinion on these and see what you guys would recommend.  
As of now, i'm leaning towards 25% QQQ and 25% VOO. Looks like VGT has outperformed both of these ETFs though so not sure why everyone recommends QQQ. VUG is also a good one but I think I would rather pick VOO. I understand there is a good amount of overlap but I will run into that problem with all these ETFs.

25% first ETF mentioned above

10% VB (small cap)  
10% IMCG (mid cap)

2. **MOAT** \- VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF ->  The fund seeks to track the performance of the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, by using full replication technique.

Say I’m 60 and have been investing for decades and am ready to retire/live off my investments. 

How is it done exactly? 

I have dividends reinvested and since I don’t cash out and only contribute, I don’t pay much attention to my accounts. Currently working full time which pays for what I need/investing/saving the rest. 


My original plan in my head was to just sell the shares as needed, thinking they’ll be way more than what I paid for them. Then I realized if I’m no longer working and selling shares, that could be a huge problem. As the shares will just be less and less. 

So I don’t really know how it’s done. I’m not too familiar with dividends as I just reinvest them. 

Is there a way to get $ without selling shares? I’m assuming that’s the dividend payment? How exactly does that work? 

Thanks for any info!

I had an exchange with someone who says that instead of picking individual stocks, just invest in $SPY or $VOO. Of course, I also see $SCHD pumped on another sub. It actually takes the fun out of these subs, because there is no originality in the thinking.

Here's the thing, there are so many other ETFs that have outperformed these indices since 2000. Note: $SPY has returned an annualized 6.4% since the beginning of 2000. Here are three index funds that have been the better option:

SPDR S&P Midcap 400 ETF ($MDY)--9.2% annual return.

SPDR Gold Shares ($GLD)--7.8% annual return.

iShares Russell 2000 ETF ($IWM)--7.3% annual return.

This is return data from the last ~23 years, so this isn't just short term trends. These are generational returns that are outside the S&P 500. It has always been my contention that if one wants to beat the index, stay away from the index of 500 companies that are part of virtually every large cap fund in the business.",2022-11-13,0,50

As an example:

Start with CSP in a Tax Advantaged Acct. (IRA) 
STO DTE: 30-45
Strike Price: 1 Standard Deviation 

Use premium collected to purchase either VTI, VOO or SPY to DCA & hold long term 

If assigned on SPY, sell CC above cost basis, collect premium to purchase more shares until called away and repeat with CSP 

If SPY continues to drop with unfavorable premiums, purchase more shares of SPY using LIFO (Last in, First Out) to lower cost basis

Main reasons for buying VTI: 
1. Lower expense (0.03% vs 0.09% for SPY) 
2. More diversified (Total Stock Market vs top 500 for SPY)

Bio: Young investor with high risk tolerance. Planning on holding for long-term. Also foreign investor with **0% capital gains tax and 30% dividend tax**. 

Title basically says all. I've been investing in individual stocks for the past year but can't afford to spend as much time on DD and news in the future. Planning on closing my positions and throwing them all into an ETF. I've been debating between VTI, VOO, and SPY, as well as SCHB. What's the overall consensus of the sub? I might prefer Vanguard just because of its lower expense ratio.

I've also received recommendations on accumulating ETFs, but I want to trade exclusively within the U.S. stock market (I'm not familiar with European markets).

But I’ve read there’s time decay with options too. So what gives, why are options seen as the better play rather than leveraged funds?

Should I try and buy individual stocks following Buffets purchases and other stocks with good dividends - Coke, Wells Fargo, AT&T, Apple, etc or just start accumulating VOO/VTI shares?

6vk8in_VOO,VOO,Noob Questions about investing in VOO,"I recently initiated a position in July and planned on adding to VOO on an incremental basis.

With the eventual correction (assuming a 5-15% hit) coming, does it make sense to wait for the correction before initiating my position/adding to my position?

Also, does it make more sense for me to invest in VOO via my Roth IRA versus Robinhood?

ARKQ is like 10% Tesla and a bunch more innovative companies. 

SPHD has a monthly dividend, I'm pretty sure (just discovered it recently). It had outpaced the S&P 500 for as long as it has been around, which is not long I'll admit. 

I own positions in both. Anyone else like these? I also like FAN and own some of that too. Cheers.",2017-06-14,26,15
