1ie1j69_VRTX,VRTX,Vertex ($VRTX),"For the first time in 20 years, there’s a real breakthrough in pain treatment. The FDA has just approved Vertex’s new non-opioid medication, offering hope to millions living with chronic pain. 

At a time when opioid addiction remains a major crisis, having an alternative that works without the risks of dependence is a game-changer. This isn’t just a medical milestone—it’s the kind of innovation that reshapes an entire market.

1aemlp7_VRTX,VRTX,Vertex (VRTX) non-opioid drug shown to kill pain without addiction,"From the Wall Street Journal:

People who are suffering from severe pain but don't want to risk addiction to an opioid are closer to a new option for treatment.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday reported positive study results for its closely watched non-opioid painkiller. The drug lowered the moderate-to-severe acute pain reported by study volunteers, a sign it could be the first in a new class of painkiller to be approved for use.

But the experimental medicine is more likely to provide an alternative to opioids, rather than supplant them, because it didn't work better than a widely used opioid drug sold under the brand name Vicodin.

Vertex said it would file for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the middle of this year.

""If and when this medicine is approved, it will offer a new option for patients who need pain relief but who do not want to take an opioid,"" Vertex Chief Scientific Officer David Altshuler said in an interview.

Vertex released the results in a press release, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. The company said the researchers who conducted the studies would publish their results in a journal later this year.

About 80 million Americans are prescribed a medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain each year, according to Vertex. They can choose from a variety of treatments. Many of them take opioids because they work so well.

Yet opioids are highly addictive, and their widespread use has fueled an epidemic of addiction and overdose deaths in the U.S.

To avoid addiction, many doctors, patients and health authorities have sought an alternative that provides as much relief from pain without creating the dependence on use.

Vertex's drug, code-named VX-548, belongs to a new class of medicines that targets molecular mechanisms involved in feeling pain. Researchers have pursued this so-called NaV class for years but experienced repeat setbacks.

NaV refers to the channels through which sodium flows in and out of cells. VX-548 blocks the flow of sodium through a channel called NaV1.8, which plays a role transmitting pain signals to the brain.

The drug, in other words, works by blocking or diminishing pain at the source before it heads to the brain and creates the feeling of pain.

Boston-based Vertex studied VX-548 in three late-stage, or Phase 3, trials that enrolled more than 2,400 subjects with conditions causing moderate-to-severe acute pain.

Two of the trials compared the efficacy of VX-548 against a placebo and Vicodin among subjects who either underwent a ""tummy tuck,"" or abdominoplasty, surgery or a bunion surgery.

The third study measured its efficacy among a range of surgical and nonsurgical acute pain issues .

Study subjects didn't show any serious adverse effects in the three studies, the company said.

Vertex is best known for its blockbuster cystic fibrosis treatments. The company received the first U.S. approval last month for a therapy that uses Crispr gene-editing technology; the drug, called Casgevy, treats people with sickle- cell disease.

VX-548 could open a new, potentially multibillion franchise in pain for the biotech company, Evercore ISI analyst Liisa Bayko said. ""It's a totally new class of drugs that have never made it this far,"" she said in an interview before the company released the trial results.

If approved, however, the drug will face heavy competition, including from low-price generics, according to analysts. To gain traction, Vertex will have to build experience and relationships in the market.

Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex's chief operating officer, said the company aims to sell this new class of medications across different pain types. Last month, the company released positive results for the drug reducing pain caused by diabetes-related nerve damage.

s19v7j_VRTX,VRTX,"vertex pharmaceuticals value, growth and cheap/","The company isnt very well known but they make the drugs for CF a rare genetic disease with the only profider in the sector. they are benefiting of the monopoly with Q on Q growth for the past couple of years.

**Balance sheet.**

the balance sheet is great with a lot of cash and no debt. vertex has about 7 billion for them to use to invest in new projects or buy back shares.

**Pipeline**

vertex has a few drugs in their pipeline for their market cap but they all are multi billion dollar projects. a pipeline is always higher risk beacuse its potential for growth and a drug costs billion before they even get approved.

they were able to cure someone with diabetis which is huge. (if u have heard about the insuline discussion lately u understand what kind of disruption this would be) If this enters the market it would be huge.

their Pain project to find a non addictive pain killer is another highly potential drug but we have to see results first. 

CTX001 is close to an approval by end of 2022. this is also a multi billion dollar project. vertex has been vage about the market but said there are a lot of 400-500k gene editing drugs and there are 25000 patients with severe SCD with most of them in a few states in the us.

&#x200B;

**Managment**

Vertex has good managment. especialy jeffery leiden is an amazing CEO but has stepped down. operations are still very well run. the new CEO hasnt made a lot of desisions yet except for an share buyback and increasing their stake in in CTX001 by 10%. 

**Moat**

their moat in CF is deep. they own 4 great products and their latest one is better then any other company has in their pipeline. making it very hard for another company to compete in the sector if they even get approved. they also own a crispr and MRNA for CF of moderna and crispr theraputic and a 5th drug which has the best results in line.

**Negatives**

the industry does have its risk and they took a big hit when 2 of their late stage drug failed. one of toxicity and another one that wasnt effective but they want to correct that one. the delay is a 4-5 years.

**Valuation**

vertex is reletively cheap at 57 bilion market cap. 850 mil in profit last quarter and most of new revenue being profit.

there is the potential to grow their revenue of CF to 12,5-13,5 billion yearly and without competition the company has almost 0 risk growth and its more about reaching there costumers insted.

with good margens and their biggest drug is new on the market there is no patent risk where it is a problem with most big pharma's.

i think the company is worth 15-20x their adjusted pe+ cash. this would be a 62,5 billion dollar and 81 billion dollars. or a per share  244-316 dollar with the recent share price of 224 there is still a 9% growth in share price right now.

**future** 

there have been an approval in the EU and a couple of reimburstments 2022 is likely to show a dubbel diget growth. the CTX001 approval would also be the new growth driver for the company

ohk73v_VRTX,VRTX,Why VRTX is a Deep Value Cash-Flow Machine,"This is my first time writing a company analysis/dd so feel free to leave any criticism in the comments. Hope this analysis is helpful to some of you.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&#x200B;

1. TRIKAFTA

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm economic moat on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute cash-flow machine for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikfta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&#x200B;

2.  GROWTH

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth >30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s high return on equity of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&#x200B;

3.  VALUATION

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings, 15.96x forward earnings, which represents a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently extremely cheap based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX\*, an intrinsic value of $406.58 can be extrapolated which presents a >50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious deep value and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (>50%) based on future outlook.

&#x200B;

4.  BALANCE SHEET

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is extremely strong with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&#x200B;

5.  RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially cure type-1 diabetes and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **>$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

lkrufm_JNJ,JNJ,Vertex Pharmaceuticals $VRTX Why THIS is the Best Value and Growth Stock in the ENTIRE Market,"In the stock market there are tons of stocks. Tons of super growers with expensive valuations, tons of slow growers with very nice valuations. But its hard to get both

If you ask me, the single best stock in terms of growth to valuation ratio is $VRTX

To begin, this stock is at such an incredible discount because most people dont understand how most biotech stocks work, or just find them to be too complicated to value

I am a PA student so I hope I can help you understand the business model a little bit better. Vertex pharmaceuticals is a company that focuses on finding cures for some of the most complex diseases on Earth. This is different from some other drug companies like JNJ who focus on low margin, easy to produce medications like Tylenol.

Vertex' biggest success is, of course, developing the best medications available for Cystic Fibrosis. This is due to defective Chloride channels (protein) within the body. They have total control over medications in this field. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease where the body is unable to create secretions. One of the most troubled organs becomes the lungs, where your body is constantly secreting mucus to fight off harmful bacteria. In people with CF, their body cannot produce this mucus and thus typically present with terrible infection, and face possible death

The medications that VRTX produces to treat CF are called small molecule medications that, when introduced to the body, interact with the defective proteins, folding them into correct and working orientation. Truly amazing technology.

While the CF business for Vertex has grow very quickly, doubling revenues consistently over the past few years, many investors are wary of Vertex' lack of diversification across their medication portfolio.

As it turns out, VRTX actually has 7 medications in their pipeline in both clinical and preclinical phase trials.

I would like to say one more time, VRTX is not in the business of producing many easy medications for small margins, they're in the business of producing groundbreaking treatments, for HUGE margins (VRTX currently has an over 40% profit margin).

Some of the medications in their pipeline aim at treating sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia through CRSPR technology (fell free to write back asking for more information), pain, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and more.

What this indicates is that VRTX is exploring many more treatments, and using CF medication revenues to finance operations. Not all of the diseases listed above will lead to medical breakthroughs, but it only takes 1 in order to take Vertex from holding a monopoly on 1 medication industry, to now Vertex holding a monopoly on MULTIPLE industries.

Great, so that was the POTENTIAL for VRTX and where the growth will be coming in for the company, but discussing the valuation for VRTX is extremely exciting.

As I already mentioned, VRTX is a company that many investors may shy away from because they might not know how the company works.

But using the information above, while comparing the fundamentals, Vertex has a forward and trailing PE under 20 (meaning less than the average for the rest of the market). I already mentioned they carry 40% margins. And they have 12% of their entire company in cash ($7 billion). Not to mention, virtually no debt ($946 million).

In their last earnings call, VRTX made it clear that they would be looking at possibly using that superb balance sheet to acquire some late stage medications and/or their respective companies. In other words, VRTX understands they need to diversify their own portfolio, and are making moves to do just that.

Vertex is an extremely profitable company with potential coming from all ends. Usually stocks like these trade with PE ratios over 100+, but VRTX is trading at less than average. If you ask me, this is the biggest sleeper stock in the entire market.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Total shot in the dark earnings plays but anyways option basically was worthless yesterday at 0.22 bid. I know it’s a very illiquid stock option and strike. I figured on a loss of 210 since it was trading at 279 around close. At 3:45 I noticed the bid was like 0.8 and ask 3.0. I knew it was probably bs algos so I put in to sell two calls at 80 and they filled right away. Then I hesitated thinking something weird going on. Holding last call but it’s worthless. Stock didn’t move. How was it possible I was able to almost get out clean with a small profit if I woulda sold the last call

6oaig2_VRTX,VRTX,Why Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) jumped 20% on 07/19/17?,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) jumped 20% as a result of Bullish news signal:

""Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated today announced positive data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of three different triple combination regimens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min). These are the first data to demonstrate the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in these patients, who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease. Data from the Phase 2 studies in these patients showed mean absolute improvements in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) of 9.7 and 12.0 percentage points from baseline for the triple combination regimens with VX-152 (200mg q12h) or VX-440 (600mg q12h), respectively. Initial data from a Phase 1 study showed a mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 of 9.6 percentage points from baseline for the triple combination regimen of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation. The company also announced today initial data showing improvements in mean absolute ppFEV1 of 7.3 and 9.5 percentage points when VX-152 or VX-440 was added in people with two copies of the F508delmutation, who were already receiving tezacaftor and ivacaftor.
The triple combination regimens were generally well tolerated across all three studies, and the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Across the studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was low.

“These safety and efficacy data are clear and compelling, indicating significant potential benefit for people with CF from each of these three different triple combination regimens,” said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “We will be collecting and evaluating additional data from these and other studies and will make a decision on which regimen(s) to take forward into pivotal program(s), which we expect to begin in the first half of 2018.”

Vertex has established a Steering Committee of global CF experts and clinical trial investigators to support the design, conduct and execution of the triple combination pivotal study program. This committee is co-chaired by Steven M. Rowe, M.D., M.S.P.H., Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics, and Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, Director of the Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, Nancy and Eugene Gwaltney Endowed Chair for Medical Research, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Jennifer Taylor-Cousar, M.D., Associate Professor, Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary Divisions, Medical Director of Clinical Research Services and Co-Director and Director of the CF Therapeutics Development Network, Adult CF Program, National Jewish Health, Colorado.

“Patients with minimal function mutations have been waiting for a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease, which makes these data showing pronounced improvements in lung function particularly important,” said Dr. Rowe. “It’s also encouraging to see that the addition of a next-generation corrector may lead to substantial additional benefits for patients with two copies of the F508del mutation, who were already receiving tezacaftor and ivacaftor.”

Explanation:

Why Bullish? Vertex said its three-drug cocktails improved lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis by 9.6 percentage points or more. The stock has been impacted by the bullish news and jumped by 20%. It is very common that these type of news (i.e. positive trial results) will impact the stock in a bullish manner. Therefore, we provide this stock a short-term bullish signal
