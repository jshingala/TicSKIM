I've been doing a lot of research regarding taking over my own retirement investments vs sticking with the default plan in fidelity that my 401(K) is in. I'm able to fund a traditional IRA via BrokerageLink. 

The ETF & REIT I've landed on (and feel confident about!!) are VTI,  SCHD and O. My questions for you all are, how do you determine your portfolio split? 

I'm 30 so still have time and want to focus on growth. Currently I'm thinking of the below splits: 

7% - $O   
40% - $SCHD  
53% - $VTI 

But interested to understand how others determine their portfolio split. At this time I'm not sure when I will be able to add to this 401K so the money that is in there currently will be it for a while. ",2025-01-20,2,6

I was reading up on strategies and I'd like some advice on how to use each investment account. 

I have a pretty high tolerance for risk. I make 250-300k annually and expect my income to grow. Originally, I was going to be more aggressive with my Roth but I realized I should be safe with the tax advantaged growth and be more risky with my taxable brokerage. 

I plan on implementing individual stocks (AMD, etc) as a part of my portfolio, investing a little in VGT (because I'm long tech SaaS), and sticking to a boglehead approach for some. 

My question is...which account should I use for what? Should I VTI/VXUS & chill in the Roth? Or should I do that in the taxable brokerage. Should my taxable brokerage be for my more risky investments? 

Would love some insight into this. 

Here is what I also plan on doing altogether:
1. Taxable - individual stocks, VTI/VXUS/VGT
2. Roth IRA - VTI/VXUS - 70/30

1hftpr3_PATH,PATH,60/40 (SCHD/VTI),"Hey everyone,

I’m 31 and currently have about $45K spread across my Roths and an individual brokerage account. My portfolio is allocated 60% SCHD and 40% VTI. I’m a big fan of the “Simple Path to Wealth” philosophy and prefer a low-maintenance, long-term investing approach.

I’ve got a long retirement time horizon and am not looking to get rich quick, but I would love to retire early if possible. Given this, I’d love to get your thoughts on a couple of questions:

1. **Are SCHD and VTI diversified enough?** Should I consider adding other ETFs to my portfolio for better diversification, or does this allocation cover enough ground?
2. **Between VTI and SCHD, should I be doubling down on one over the other?** I like SCHD’s dividend focus, but I also appreciate VTI’s broad market exposure.

Would love to hear your perspectives! Thanks in advance!",2024-12-16,10,10

1dypqmj_VTI,VTI,"SCHD vs VTI, Roth IRA, and other questions.","Currently 19 and have just over 19k in a Schwab account that I was able to build up from working. The foundation of my portfolio is SCHD at 38% and VTI at 35% while the rest of it is a mix of other ETFs and individual stocks. 

My investment strategy is mainly guided by this subreddit, which is to hold dividend-producing securities (SCHD) into retirement without any intention on selling. However, it's my understanding that SCHD doesn't grow as much as VTI because the companies within the SCHD are very big. This is why I own both, which seems like a good strategy. 

This brings me to my question. It doesn't really make sense to me to hold all of my VTI into retirement because the dividend is not nearly as much. Therefore, would it make more sense to open a Roth IRA and continue to purchase VTI within that account while also continuing to purchase SCHD within my regular brokerage account? In this case I would still experience the growth of VTI while also getting the tax benefits, so a large chunk is not taken out of the nest egg. This way I would be able to make use of the funds from VTI in retirement or reinvest it to buy more SCHD. 

I know that I am thinking very far into the future, but I want to get these things figured out as quickly as possible so I can stick to a plan.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1990h15/comment/kibbe2h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

JEPI doesn't have lots of history so use JEPIX in your comparison. Looks at the metrics.

* JEPI has much better stdev, way less drawdown, much better Sharpe ratio, Sortino Ratio and way lower market correlation than VT.
* VXUS, BND are completely garbages, they severely underperforms even QYLD (which Boogerhead calls garbage), let alone JEPI/JEPIX.

See for yourself: [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=43M1C5t8cG0yEC5Y2fc7i](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=43M1C5t8cG0yEC5Y2fc7i)

VTI/VTSAX is all the Boogerhead has left and it only works well in the last 10 years (didn't work the decade before that but hey). Rest of their craps are falling apart faster than toilet paper in contact with water.

Disclaimer: I don't own JEPI, just find it hilarious that Boogerhead has the nerve to spread FUD and shill for garbage in this sub while people were not paying attentions.

And let's further suppose that the strategies under consideration are more long term in nature than short term.  So holding periods of a month or longer, no need for tick data.  Would want to reconstruct open/close/dividends/adjusted close by day, if possible.

Are there any ideas on how one could construct historical data in a trustworthy way for backtesting these past their true histories? Or is this a bad idea?

I am relatively new to long term investing and have been building a dividend portfolio for about 6 months now.

I have a question about retiring on ETFs like VOO/VTI. Is the idea to keep selling some shares and live off that? If yes, what makes it sustainable? 

Dividend ETFs are intuitive to me. That is, build a big enough portfolio and live off dividends and keep adding a portion of dividend back to portfolio.

Any insight would be helpful. Apologies if this is not the right forum to ask this question.

all of it is going into a fund MXWEX and the return has been roughly 5% thus far.   
it looks like i have the ability to re-balance into PRWCX Fund which seems to have done way better overall vs MXWEX. Or the other thought was to stop making contributions to the 457 and take that money and put into personal roth..  
the only diff i see is roth is post tax, and this fund is pre-tax i think.

I love the idea of dividends, but I also know I won't be retiring any time soon. It seems like going for growth stocks is a good plan, but I wanted to see if I could get some other opinions about my current plan.

I have looked into stocks like QYLD/RYLD/JEPI/NUSI/SDIV/JEPQ/VTI/VOO. I have looked at their history, and portfolios and tried to gather information to the best of my limited abilities on stocks. After looking into all this information I think my current plan is.

QYLD - 25%

JEPI - 25%

VTI - 50%

Since I have time to let it grow I chose VTI as my growth stock, and QYLD/JEPI as my dividends. I chose JEPI > JEPQ because of its age and because it targets different stocks than the QYLD which is heavily based on tech companies like JEPQ and VTI.

I'm honestly just looking for opinions about this if you think this is a horrible decision and should just aim for growth or only high-yield dividend stocks. If you think it is an okay starting point, but have your own input on how I might be able to make it better.

y9xr61_PG,PG,There's more to index funds and stocks than VTI and AAPL. Welcome to the world of small cap value stocks.,"An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?

The answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]

This post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.

**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**

[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

From another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):

> As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000® Index) led both large caps (S&P 500®) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap®) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.

**Why target cheaper stocks (value, not growth) ?**

 Here are the excess returns (annualized over 1964-2017) of small cap stocks sorted by the cheapness: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/f4lHHSk.png). The cheapest stocks are on the left. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

This has been validated in the literature, for example by the AQR paper [""Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk""](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Size-Matters-If-You-Control-Your-Junk). Essentially, small cap stocks contain a lot of 'junk,' especially among the small cap growth class. [Note: By growth, we use the academic definition of high price / (book value).]

Thus, I would not recommend targeting small cap growth in particular. Growth really just means expensive, and what the data shows is targeting cheaper stocks (value) and applying quality filters like profitability requirements yields better returns.

**Why target small cap value now or in the near future?**

**It's a good hedge if there is a decade stagnation of the broader markets**

You aren't just tilting a riskier asset class, you're tilting something that is less correlated to the broader market than your typical stock holdings. Hedge yourselves against a lost decade with this asset class.

**But why add if VTI already has small cap value inside it?**

Because market weights aren't gospel, and just as someone with less risk tolerance adds bonds, someone with more can add small cap value. VTI places 3% of its allocation into the SCV category. How about make it 10%?

**Ticker recommendations**:

I use AVUV/AVDV personally for US small cap value and ex-US developed small cap value. Some people also use VIOV or VBR. You could of course pick your own stocks, but the risk is definitely amplified.

I explain [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrwvxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/iqjujjw/) how Avantis (who created AVUV and AVDV) approach their ETFs. They already use quality filters to make sure you avoid junk while still getting a diversified exposure. 

> They look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies ""tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning
their prices are high relative to fundamentals) causing subsequent
underperformance."" And they tend to give weight to momentum, because you shouldn't just throw out a company from an index because it is doing *too* well.  Thus, you get a diversified (>600 companies in AVUV) exposure to some of the cheapest, small cap companies out there, that are highly profitable, organically growing, invest conservatively, and (may) have positive momentum. In contrast, the S&P 500 is highly dominated by a few enormously sized companies that engage in large amounts of acquisitions. Not that that's a bad thing.

y9xr61_AAPL,AAPL,There's more to index funds and stocks than VTI and AAPL. Welcome to the world of small cap value stocks.,"An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?

The answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]

This post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.

**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**

[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

From another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):

> As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000® Index) led both large caps (S&P 500®) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap®) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.

I have created an excel sheet that can compare two different ticker symbols and tell you the ideal weight between the two lowering the portfolios overall volatility.

Because VOO has a greater mean return, the higher the amount of VTI the lower the return. However having some VTI will decrease your standard deviation of return, ensuring less volatile growth.

I have highlighted the portfolios of highest return and lowest volatility. As you can see, if your portfolio has just VOO and VTI, the more VOO you have, the greater your return. However a portfolio of 52% VOO and 48% VTI is the most consistent. Owning any more VTI will result in similar volatility with less mean returns meaning you are taking on unnecessary risk.",2022-04-29,47,9

For my portfolio, I've got about 50% weighting in VOO. Had some big winners (like Ford) and also a handful of losers (like PYPL). I'm going to continue investing in individual stocks because it's a fun hobby, but I may increase my VOO allocation from 50% to 60-75%. No shame in that.

jkox71_PATH,PATH,Should I invest in VTI via Robinhood or VTSAX via Vanguard?,"Hi guys,

I'm 25 and new to investing and am almost finished reading JL Collins' book, The Simple Path to Wealth. I read on his blog that VTI is the ETF version of VTSAX. Right now I have 3 shares of VTI in Robinhood. I want to keep going but I want to know the answer to this question before I do. I'm investing for the long haul. I heard in the book that you have to be careful of ""commissions and spreads"" if you are using brokerages other than Vanguard. I know that Vanguard is commission-free, **(1) but are there ""spreads"" or any hidden fees that would make me lose more money than if I went directly into VTSAX via Vanguard account?** Their expense ratios are pretty much the same/negligible, no?

In older posts, people said they preferred Vanguard over Robinhood because you could do automatic investments as well as dividend reinvestments, but it appears that both are now possible in Robinhood. **(2) With that being said, if I invested say 5% of every paycheck for 50 years on Robinhood VTI and 5% into VTSAX via Vanguard, would I have the same amount of money? I am afraid there has to be more fees associated with Robinhood because they are the middleman, they have to make money somehow, right? And are there ""spreads"" that would take money away from me?**

PS, I'm aware you need a minimum of $3K to invest in VTSAX via Vanguard, and this doesn't bother me.
