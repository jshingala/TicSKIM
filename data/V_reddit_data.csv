1kwujy6_SNOW,SNOW,PPP.V High Potential with good Historical Exploration in the Yukon.,"As the snow starts to melt in the Yukon far north exploration opportunities and drill programs start to come back to life.  In anticipation of that I figured I would throw out one that seems to have really good potential.  Located in the same area as Snowline Gold Corp $SGD and Sitka $SIG lies Prospector Metals, Mike Lake property.   Previously drilled ten years ago by a different team with good results a new team is taking a look with a new interpretation based on technology that was previously unavailable.  The team previously sold a project in the same area (Kaminak, Coffee Gold) for $500 million.  They already have a partner in B2 Gold $TSE:BTO who holds 9% equity in the company.  Drilling is set to commence in the next few weeks.  The company is fully financed to do a drill program so between now and drilling there won’t be any additional dilution.  If you take the time to look at the chart you will see that in anticipation of drilling the price has been increasing.  In short it’s definitely a gamble however if all goes according to plan within 3 months it could be worth between $100-$200 million dollars if the results are positive.",2025-05-27,0,2

1ktg3dq_NET,NET,This Little-Known Company’s Network Effect Might Rival Visa’s,"*Summary*
SPS Commerce isn’t a name you’ll see on billboards, but in the world of retail supply chains, they’re everywhere. They help stores and brands exchange the essential documents that keep products flowing—things like purchase orders, invoices, and shipping updates—without relying on emails, spreadsheets, or outdated manual processes. That may sound mundane, but the business model is anything but.

Once a company connects to SPS, they’re unlikely to leave. And new customers often find it’s the only practical option if they want to work with big-name retailers. That’s a classic network effect—and it’s what makes SPS surprisingly hard to replace.

*What They Actually Do*
SPS runs a cloud-based platform that lets retailers, suppliers, distributors, and warehouses talk to each other in a structured, automated way. The tech behind it is called EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), which is a standard for sending business documents digitally.

Think of it like a universal translator for the supply chain. Instead of everyone building custom connections to one another, they plug into SPS, and SPS handles the formatting, rules, and compliance.

*Some of Their Top Customers*
SPS doesn’t always name every client publicly, but through press releases, case studies, and partner integrations, we know they work with:

•	Walmart

•	Target

•	Costco

•	Amazon (3rd-party seller connections)

•	Best Buy

•	Nordstrom

•	Dollar General

•	The Home Depot (via supplier network)

They also support thousands of mid-size and smaller businesses who supply these retailers. In many cases, the retailer will require their suppliers to use SPS to stay compliant with order and shipping processes.

In other words: if you want shelf space with a major retailer, chances are you’re using SPS—or you’re losing time and money trying not to.

*Why Customers Stay*

1.	Switching is expensive and messy
Once a company is hooked into SPS, changing systems would mean rebuilding how they connect with every partner they trade with. That’s a major project with lots of risk.

2.	Retailers push vendors toward SPS
If you’re a supplier and your big-box customer wants you to use SPS, saying no usually isn’t an option.

3.	It just works

Most clients aren’t looking to reinvent how they send invoices or confirm shipments. They just want it to happen automatically in the background. SPS delivers that.

*Why New Customers Choose SPS*

•	Everyone’s already using it: Joining the SPS network means you can plug into hundreds or thousands of trading partners with minimal setup.

•	Built-in compliance: SPS already knows what data format Walmart or Target wants. Trying to manage that yourself is asking for chargebacks or canceled orders.

•	Reputation: They’ve been doing this for over 20 years. That kind of trust takes time to earn, and competitors can’t copy it overnight.

Revenue That Sticks
SPS makes money from subscriptions and usage-based fees. Customers pay for the number of partners they connect with and the volume of documents they send. As their business grows, so does the amount they pay SPS.

Retention is high:

•	Gross retention: ~97% (clients don’t leave)

•	Net retention: 110%+ (existing clients spend more over time)

This is a system that grows with the customer, not one that needs constant reselling.

*Practical Risks*

No business is risk-free. Here are a few real concerns to keep in mind:

1.	EDI could become less relevant
If large players like Amazon push for entirely new communication standards (e.g., API-first integrations), SPS could fall behind if it’s too locked into legacy systems.

2.	Big customers have bargaining power
If a major retailer (like Walmart) decides to switch to or build its own system, SPS could lose a large chunk of volume and credibility fast.

3.	Security and downtime
Since SPS is embedded into critical supply chain operations, any outage, hack, or system failure could have major consequences—and cost them clients.

4.	Competition from modern platforms
Younger SaaS platforms with better user interfaces and developer tools may chip away at the edges, especially with startups and smaller suppliers.

5.	Slow international growth
SPS is dominant in North America, but less so globally. If competitors scale internationally faster, SPS may miss out on the next wave of supply chain tech growth.

*Final Take*

SPS Commerce is a quiet workhorse of the retail world. It doesn’t have the buzz of an AI company or the excitement of a consumer brand. But it does something arguably more valuable: it builds infrastructure that’s hard to leave.

And like Visa, the more people plug in, the more powerful the network becomes.

Another Judicial Milestone was reached Monday. Great coverage of this yesterday on an article that didn't get much press time, but is highly significant.

In the trial on Monday, The President of Spain’s CHG water authority confirmed that Grupo México’s mine plan has undergone a “substantial change” since it was awarded—including removal of discharge into the Guadalquivir basin. Under Spanish law, a material post-award change can invalidate the concession. It also confirms that the original bid posed environmental risks, supporting Emerita’s legal argument that the tender was improperly awarded.

1kccv6u_V,V,Inspiration Energy ($ISP.CN | $ISPNF)  beside Ramp Metals ($RAMP.V) Currently trading 0.185 on the Canadian market. US symbol received with market access expected any day.,"Ramp Metals Inc. (TSXV: RAMP) has announced a significant new discovery at its Rottenstone SW property in northern Saskatchewan, identifying a mineralized target known as the ""Rush"" zone. This discovery is particularly noteworthy as it lies directly adjacent to Inspiration Energy Corp.'s (CSE: ISP) Rottenstone North Gold Project, potentially indicating a shared geological trend.

Rush Target Discovery

The Rush target was identified during a recent mapping and sampling program, which revealed surface rock samples with assays up to 1.61% copper, 0.79 g/t gold, and 113 g/t silver. These mineralized zones overlie a 1,200-meter conductive anomaly, suggesting a significant subsurface target for further exploration.

Geologically, the Rush zone aligns with a northeast-southwest (NE-SW) trending corridor, consistent with the regional structural framework of the Rottenstone Domain. This alignment is significant as it mirrors the trend of the historical Rottenstone nickel-copper-PGE-gold mine, which produced approximately 26,057 tonnes of high-grade nickel between 1965 and 1968.

Proximity to Inspiration Energy’s Property

Inspiration Energy's Rottenstone North Gold Project lies directly northwest of Ramp Metals' Rottenstone SW property, bordering the Rush target area. This proximity suggests that the Rush zone could extend into Inspiration's landholdings, potentially enhancing the prospectivity of their project. Inspiration's management has expressed optimism about the implications of this discovery, highlighting the strategic location of their property in a region with a history of high-grade mineralization..

Next Steps and Exploration Plans

Ramp Metals is mobilizing for an extensive geophysical survey using the Xcite HTDEM system, covering approximately 2,877 line-kilometres with 100-meter line spacing. This high-resolution survey aims to refine target areas for an upcoming drill program, with the Rush target being a primary focus.

Inspiration Energy plans to commence exploration operations on the Rottenstone North Gold Project, leveraging the new data from Ramp Metals' discovery to inform their exploration strategy.

Conclusion

The identification of the Rush target by Ramp Metals Inc. is a promising development for both companies. It indicates the potential for a significant mineralized system extending across their adjacent properties. The alignment of this discovery with the regional geological trend enhances the area's prospectivity, and both companies are poised to advance their exploration efforts in this underexplored region of Saskatchewan.

Disclosure. I have a position with both companies. The main shareholder for Ramp is Sprott, who financed the recent exploration on the Ramp property. The key reason for taking a position in ISP is their current float of 18 million shares and market cap of 2.36MM. Ramp has 42 million shares and a market cap of 55.8MM. Both are are well worth a look. ",2025-05-01,2,2

I have some experience with trading vertical spreads on a swing-level (hold for a week to a month), but usually I just let them reach maturity. I understand that in day trading people typically open and close a position in the same day. My question is: I would like to set my stops at certain price levels of the underlying (e.g. SPY), but it seems like I can only set those orders based on the price of those options contracts, not SPY itself (I'm using thinkorswim fyi). I'm also not sure how to calculate my potential loss between my entry price and my stop loss price before entering the trade. So, I'm going in very blind, and I don't like having to manage the position so actively - my emotions can take more control and it's harder for me to stick to a predefined set of limits via bracket orders.



1. How can I calculate how an option will be priced at certain price levels, so that I can assess whether the trade aligns with my risk tolerance?
2.  In general, what advice do you have about this? Any resources I should check out, or your own risk management strategies in this area.

1jdkwck_V,V,Emerita Resources ($EMOTF $EMO.V) - Update on the Setup. Still destined for billions IMO,"A month ago, I laid out why **Emerita** had the potential for a major move this year. Since then, the stock heated up, running to **$2.00**, before pulling back a sizeable amount. There was no bad news, in my view it was  just a mix of profit-taking and cooling off after a strong run. Now that the dust has settled, I wanted to go over what has actually changed since my last post because the setup is looking even better now.

The **Aznalcóllar trial officially began on March 3rd**. Some investors expected an instant resolution, but the legal process is now in its final stage. The next big date is **March 31**, when the first three defendants appear in court. By **April 17**, **13 of the 16 accused will have gone before the sentencing judge**, including the two key players behind the fraud.

What matters here is how strong the legal case actually is.

* Spanish law states that if a public tender was awarded through a crime, it gets voided automatically and must be given to the next qualified bidder.
* **Emerita is the only qualified bidder.** There is no competition. It is either them or no one.
* The **public prosecutor, who had always pushed against Emerita’s claims, is now fully aligned with them.** They rejected all of the defense’s delay tactics and are backing the case to move forward without annulments.
* **Five Superior Court judges have already ruled crimes were committed.** This trial is about sentencing, not re-litigating the fraud itself.

Some investors bailed when Aznalcóllar was not awarded immediately, but this was never going to be a one-day event imo. The trial is playing out exactly as expected, and everything still points to the same outcome. **Emerita getting awarded the asset.**

Meanwhile, **analysts are finally putting a price tag on Aznalcóllar.**

* A new valuation **estimates it at C$1.48B**, translating to **C$3.85 per EMO share**.
* That is just for **Aznalcóllar alone**. It does not even factor in IBW, the new Ontario land package, or anything else.

And speaking of IBW, **Emerita just put out a major resource update, and it is even bigger than expected.**

* **Indicated resources increased 35 percent. Inferred resources up 44 percent.** 14mt to almost 19 indicated, plus 6 inferred, north of 25mt!
* **El Cura was officially added to the resource, confirming a new copper-rich deposit.**
* With IBW growing like this, an **NPV north of $1B is looking more realistic.**

On top of that, Emerita **finally secured the Ontario exploration permit**, which expands their land package around IBW by **three times**. This area has **historic high-grade copper mines**, and early sampling already returned **13.2 percent copper**, confirming strong mineralization. This is not just extra land. It is highly prospective, and any discoveries there could feed directly into IBW’s future development.



Stock has pulled back a bit from its highs, but nothing has actually gone wrong. If anything, the fundamentals have only improved. This is still a setup where one court ruling could send the valuation into a completely different stratosphere, and in my personal non-financial advisor opinion, I believe we can see 1B valuation this year. Do your own research, there is a ton of info out there on this play.

Still holding, and still liking the risk-reward here. I personally have an average price of around 1.55 and will likely scoop up more if we see some dips. ",2025-03-17,9,3

1iypsze_V,V,Kraken Robotics ($PNG.V): A Huge Opportunity in the Growing Global Defense Market,"Kraken Robotics Inc., a Canadian marine technology company, has recently secured orders totaling $34 million for its SeaPower™ pressure-tolerant batteries from three clients. To meet the increasing demand in the defense sector for uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs), Kraken is expanding its production capabilities by opening a new battery manufacturing facility in Nova Scotia.

In recognition of its outstanding performance, Kraken Robotics was ranked as the top-performing company on the 2025 TSX Venture 50 list. This annual ranking highlights the strongest companies on the TSX Venture Exchange based on share price appreciation, market capitalization growth, and trading volume. Kraken's impressive 323% share price increase and addition of over $587 million to its market capitalization underscore its robust growth trajectory.

The current geopolitical climate, marked by Canada's unwavering support for Ukraine and a global trend toward military enhancement, has amplified the demand for advanced defense technologies. Kraken's expertise in providing high-resolution 3D acoustic imaging solutions and subsea robotics positions it well to capitalize on this demand. The company's strategic expansion in Nova Scotia aims to address the rising needs of the defense market, particularly in Europe, where Kraken has established a significant customer base.

Furthermore, Kraken's active participation in international defense exercises, such as the annual REPMUS exercise in Portugal, demonstrates its commitment to innovation and collaboration. During this exercise, Kraken's Miniature Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Sonar (MINSAS) was evaluated by five NATO navies, successfully identifying over 50 mine-like targets. This achievement highlights Kraken's technological prowess and its vital role in enhancing global maritime security. 

In summary, Kraken Robotics' recent financial successes, strategic expansions, and recognition as a leading technology company position it as a compelling investment opportunity.

1iowcl0_V,V,Grid Battery Metals (CELL.V - TSX): Expanding into Lithium & Copper,"For those following junior mining companies, **Grid Battery Metals (CELL.V)** has been making some moves recently. The company has focused on **lithium exploration** in Nevada but recently expanded its portfolio by acquiring a **copper project in British Columbia**—a well-known region for large-scale copper-gold deposits.

# What’s Interesting?

* **Undervalued relative to cash** – Market cap is $6.5M, with $4.5M in cash. This means the market is assigning minimal value to its projects.
* **Drilling near a key lithium mine** – Their Clayton Valley project is adjacent to Albemarle’s **Silver Peak mine**, the only lithium-producing mine in North America.
* **Potential M&A interest** – The region has seen consolidation, with large companies looking to secure long-term battery metal supply.

# Geological Context:

* **Porphyry copper-gold deposits** – The copper project is in a region with these types of deposits, which are large and often mined at a lower grade but can be highly valuable over time.
* **Lithium basin geology** – CELL’s lithium projects share similarities with more advanced projects in Nevada, including **Thacker Pass**, which recently saw a major investment from General Motors.

# Big Picture:

Copper prices are near record highs, while lithium prices have dropped from their 2022 peak. Some analysts believe lithium prices are nearing production-cost levels, which could impact future supply. CELL’s mix of lithium and copper projects could provide flexibility in changing market conditions.

Liberty Defense currently has a combined $11 million cash from a private placement and exercised warrants recently secured and announced.

We have Hexwave, next gen AI recognition millimeter wave body scanners, they protect the public's privacy by not exposing imaging data to security staff instead only identifying a threat and revealing where on the body it would be hidden. Detects ghost guns, IEDs, etc, they boast having higher detection accuracy and fewer false positives than their competition, and have gone through beta testing in IRL sites around the world and in military testing with confidential results. The base tech for Hexwave body scanners was commercialized to them by MIT. The Hexwave is fully ready for market and is already in the hands of international distributors with contracts for the product like LineV, Smith's Detection, GRASP, Viken Detection, to name a few.

They also produce shoe scanner devices with significant funding from the TSA to help this effort. These are not ready yet for the market. TSA was at CES 2025 showing off the shoe scanners and they performed well but some users were able to trick them with gummy worms, although plastic knives did not trick them. They are working on improving this yet through further AI model training.

They also produce ""HD AIT"" upgrade kits. High Definition Advanced Imaging Technology is designed as a physical upgrade kit for existing millimeter wave body scanners already in the field, enhancing them with new AI powered image scanning capabilities. They claim the technology will allow passengers to pass through without removing bags and light outerwear, while providing improved imaging, detection, fewer false positives, and a faster smoother experience for all.

https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/liberty-defense-receives-contract-modification-from-tsa-for-continued-development-of-ait-screening-kits-892300000.html

Re: HD AIT kits and shoe scanners

    Both technologies were developed by researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, funded by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate on behalf of the Transportation Security Administration mission. Liberty is now developing the technology in house with its experienced team of engineers.

Today the stock price shot up again after Liberty announced full and unconditional FCC approval for the HD AIT upgrade kits, which means they are now legally allowed to commercialize and sell these kits in the USA.

The company does not have good revenues yet because commercialization is just getting started. Revenues from sales were about $5 m last year (after anticipating $6.5 m) mostly from contracts with distributors. They are hoping to reach $25 million revenue this year, and then $125 million the year after that. They expect the HD AIT upgrade kits to pull in more revenue than the Hexwave by the end of next year.

Management has followed through on their time commitments and has generally met every deadline they've given us over the past 3 or 4 years now within a small margin of error. They've executed impressively IMO.

The $11m cash secured recently will go towards meeting outstanding sales orders of Hexwave that need to be filled, increasing production and marketing to meet greater demand globally, and improving the efficiency of all their technology.

They have Hexwave in several places and recently began undertaking security trials of their equipment with ""a certain US strategic ally in the middle east"" - remembering that part of the Israel Palestine ceasefire includes controlling the entire borderline of Gaza including their border with Egypt.

Because Revenues are still virtually non existent at this point and we are waiting on further announcements of contracts and sales for Hexwave, all I can really say you are investing in at this point is the amazing technology, the reliable management team full of excellent engineers and security experts with relationships to international agencies around the world, the incredibly tight relationship with the TSA who is expected to announce enforcement of employee screening soon, and the anticipation of a politically tense world landscape, with projections for global growth in the millimeter wave body scanner market.

The millimeter wave body scanner market is anticipated to grow from $487m USD to $836m USD, here is one report projecting this, there are several reports with very similar projections available if you search the web.

1hf17r0_V,V,Why Aberdeen (AAB.V) is a buy,"I saw that Dev Shetty has just been appointed the CEO of Aberdeen, which piqued my interest.

Shetty has an excellent track record as a mining executive. He founded Fura Gems in 2017, which went on the find the largest ruby sold at auction ($ 34.5 million). He has been involved with several mining companies, including Prospect, which sold for over $ 500 million.

And he has bought 14.5 million shares from the market in December (about $ 600,000 worth) and been granted 5 million options. So he's incentivised.

Aberdeem has languished for years now, since it was founded in 2007. Having raised more than $ 50 million to invest in resource companies, it's only success was Brazil Potash which recently listed in the US, as I looked through their financial statements and MDA on Sedar.

The 621, 851 shares of GRO that Aberdeen owns (with a quoted price of US$ 9.70) means its market value is worth about C$ 8.5 million, which is about $ 1.5 million more than the market cap of of Aberdeen at about $ 7 million. This can be liquidated at a moment's notice as needed.

The website is outdated, there are no recent comments on the BBs, no one cares. Except.....

Why did Shetty not roll back, say, 10-1 and then invest? Because if you are going to bring in large instituitional investors, you need a sizeable public float so they can each get meaningful allocations of Aberdeen capital stock.

This tells me that a big deal(s) are afoot. So I bought 190,000 shares on Friday.

1gifbp9_V,V,Time In Market v Decrease Cost Averaging ,"Bit of a thought experiment that I can't quite comprehend myself. 

Basic strategy as I understand it for those of us who don't have hundreds of thousands to invest is to pick large ETFs or market funds such as VTI or VOO or QQQ and long hold. I have a mixed portfolio with a less aggressive 401k and a market based IRA, and also a personal investment portfolio comprised of some blue chips, some companies I like that I'm not dependent on for growth, and some ETFs. 

For my personal portfolio I have a few thousand investable held in SPAXX with fidelity. Now that the stage is set here's the thought: is it better to make a lump sum investment to have more overall time in the market for the money I have liquid or is it better to invest that money systematically over the span of 6 to 12 months in the event the market turns during the US election so as to DCA my investments over said time?

1gbanhq_V,V,ETL.V DD and future prospects ,"**Introduction:** 

E3 Lithium (ETL.V) is a lithium extraction company based out of Alberta Canada. They are committed to being one of the worlds greenest and most environmentally sustainable lithium producers, which is easy for them since they are extracting from brine. (No open pit mining). On top of this they are on track to be one of the first major providers of battery grade lithium in not just Canada but, if we exclude China, the world. 

**Financial info, their project, and funding:**

Let's get this out of the way, they have no revenue. They released their PFS for the Clearwater project in June outlining an after tax NPV of 3.72 billion sporting an impressive 24.6% IRR which is quite high for an engineering project like this, albeit compared to other lithium companies I looked at it's on the low side. The issue, and why I believe the price didn't explode on the release of their PFS, is the capex and assumed lithium price. Their capex, at 2.47 billion, is very high compared to their competitors. Hence the lower IRR. The reasoning behind this is because they are extracting from brine, aiming for low carbon emissions, and using water recycling techniques to lower their surface footprint. The other issue is the lithium price. They are assuming an LHM price of $31k (usd) which is over 3x what the price is currently. Their is a reason for this and I'll talk more about it later. Going back to capex they can't fund the project on their own, they need either a partner or a lot of government funding, if they get this their share price will explode immediately. Info on their debt and other financial info is in the math section. Funding: they have a deal of sorts with imperial oil and recently received a $5million grant from the Alberta government. 

**Lithium price projections:**

China has been flooding the market with lithium in hope of chocking out their competitors. And it's working, lithium prices have fallen from ATH to ATL in a year; and with it the entire lithium sector. When I last looked the average price change for lithium companies over the course of the last year was -88%. But they can't afford to drive it lower, Jiangxi stopped production a month ago (they make up 8% of china's production) to try and bring the price up. Their also isn't demand for it currently, EV's are still taking off and so is the green energy sector. So where did E3 get their $31k price from? Analysts. They are predicting an average price of $31k usd from when E3 is set to begin production in 2028 to when they are set to finish production 50 years later. 

**News and promising outlook:**

The only big thing I haven't already mentioned is they entered into a joint development agreement with Pure Lithium to develop batteries (for long term energy storage and electric vehicles) using their lithium.

Also they finished their pilot study. 

See more here: [https://www.e3lithium.ca/newsroom/news-releases/](https://www.e3lithium.ca/newsroom/news-releases/)

**Why I'm bullish**

If you go through my comment history you will see I worked as a business development analyst at a lithium company over the summer and this is one the companies I was looking at. The thing that really caught my eye was A their share price was beating the market (as in the -88% not spy) and B their NPV is massive in comparison to their peers. It increased 4.5x  from their Preliminary economic assessment! The share price is 50% lower now then it was last year despite a lot of positive outlook coming out of this company and if/when the lithium price turns around and begins to climb I believe we will see this company emerge as one of the largest gainers. Their market cap is only 63.5 million USD with potential profit of several billion from the clearwater project alone. Imperial oil also holds a stake in the company.

My comments prior where bearish on lithium. I believe China cutting their production is Bullish. E3 is also a larger company compared to their peers. They where top 5-6 for market cap of the ones I was watching which gives me hope they can survive until lithium prices are where they need them to be. 

**Some Math:**

FCF = 531mil - 531mil \* 0.08 - 2.47billion/50 = 439mil 

Net Debt=55.994million−24.736million=31.258million

Equity Value=3700million−31.258million=3,668.742million

Share Price= 3668.742million​/75,269,397 (outstanding shares) = $48.74 share price based off their NPV



My position: 4.2k shares @ $1.2, I just bought 

Price Target: I wouldn't take the math at face value, my prediction is $5-10 by 2028. 

This was my first DD so if you read it let me know what you think.

1g9wndh_V,V,"Outcrop Silver & Gold (OCG.v, OCGSF) Reports High-Grade Results at Santa Ana’s Aguilar Vein, Highlights 928 g/t AgEq Over 1 Meter","Last week, Outcrop Silver & Gold (OCG.v or OCGSF for U.S. investors) announced promising drill results from the Aguilar vein, part of its fully owned Santa Ana silver project in Colombia.



The initial resource estimate for Santa Ana, released last summer, detailed:

* *Measured & Indicated Resource:* 24.2 million ounces of silver equivalent at a grade of 614 g/t.
* *Inferred Resource:* 13.5 million ounces at 435 g/t silver equivalent.



The recent drilling results show strong potential for expanding the current resource base at Santa Ana, particularly through the Aguilar vein.



**Key Exploration Highlights:**

* *Drill Hole DH399:* Intercepted 928 g/t silver equivalent (AgEq) over 1.08 meters, confirming vein continuity along 650 meters of strike and 200 meters of depth.
*  *Weighted Average Grades:*
   * Aguilar vein system: 568 g/t AgEq
   * Aguilar North: 974 g/t AgEq
   * Aguilar FW: 750 g/t AgEq



The ongoing exploration also identified new, non-outcropping veins, enhancing the project's potential for multiple high-grade zones. Drilling at Aguilar continues to reveal high-grade mineralization at depth, with the deepest intercept at 200 meters.



Outcrop is advancing the project using two drill rigs, now focused on the Jimenez and La Ye veins to further extend Santa Ana's resource potential.



Guillermo Hernandez, VP of Exploration, stated that the results from Aguilar affirm the project's potential for significant resource growth.

1fswn5m_V,V,Silver Wolf Exploration $SWLF.V - A Speculative Bet on Silver,"Silver Wolf Exploration $SWLF.V is a TSX-V listed company focused on exploring high potential projects in the prime silver and gold regions of Mexico.

Their main focus is the Ana Maria property in Durango. Ana Maria consists of 9 mining concessions encompassing 2,549 hectares (ha). The claims are located in a well-known area that is prolific for carbonate replacement deposits (CRDs) in the vicinity of many active or historic mining operations. The Ana Maria property is located:

1.    9km away and on trend from the historic Ojuela Mine which produced 160 Million ounces of silver

2.    25km away from the La Platosa Mine, which had been the highest-grade silver mine in Mexico since commencing production in 2005 until it was placed under care and maintenance in 2022



CRDs are high-temperature, epigenetic and intrusive sulphide-dominant deposits that are rich in lead, zinc and silver, have major regional geologic features and occur in clusters. The Mexican CRD belt is one of the best-developed clusters of its kind in the world.  
  
Silver Wolf has operational synergies with Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd. $ASM and shares many years of combined experience in exploration, development and production. Indeed, Avino owns 9.4% of the Company and its top brass form the Company's C-Suite. Silver Wolf management has been relentlessly buying shares and own 50% of the Company with Chairman David Wolfin alone controlling 25%.

  
In addition, Silver Wolf has an experienced geological field team who have worked on similar projects with a demonstrated understanding of the jurisdiction and local communities.  
  
A 2500m 15-hole drill program at the El Soldado area of the Ana Maria property commenced in the beginning of September with the Company seeking to make a discovery after preliminary exploration yielded positive results.

During a recent field visit to the Ana Maria Property, Red Cloud Securities were quite bullish in their assessment of Silver Wolf's chances of success:

  
""After visiting Silver Wolf's project, we are of the opinion that they could be poised to make a greenfield discovery with its maiden drilling program. The area has numerous characteristics that we believe enhance the odds of drilling success.""  
  
Assays from the drill program are expected in Q4.



Overall, Silver Wolf Exploration $SWLF.V is a solid bet in this silver bull market with the below factors going for it: 

* Drills Turning

* Tight float

* C$6.4m Market Cap

* Top notch management

* 50% insider ownership

* Silver in its name ;-)

DoJ to allege Visa monopolized U.S. debit card market - report

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Visa (V.N), opens new tab shares fell 3% on Tuesday after a report said the U.S. Department of Justice plans to file a lawsuit against the world's largest payment processor, alleging it illegally monopolized the country's debit-card market.

The antitrust division of the regulator is set to file a lawsuit as soon as Tuesday, accusing Visa of a range of anti-competitive conduct, Bloomberg News reported, opens new tabon Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

""We believe this is an immediate negative to shares but we caution these types of antitrust cases are notoriously known for long/winding paths in the U.S.,"" boutique equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co said.
Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

FRESH ANTITRUST SCRUTINY

The company has been facing heightened scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for years, battling allegations of a duopoly with Mastercard (MA.N), opens new tab . Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.
""The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,"" brokerage TD Cowen said.

""It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.""

News of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.
Brokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.
The prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to ""see the intentions of the next administration,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.

""If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle. There is a lot of uncertainty when you have protracted court battles, especially against the government.""

Mastercard shares fell 1% in morning trade. Both stocks have underperformed broader markets this year, gaining 11% and 16.5% respectively, compared with the S&P 500's (.SPX), opens new tab near 20% gain.

“*It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price*” - Warren Buffett. It's definitely about Visa.

Visa's strategic acquisitions and partnerships are driving long-term growth and revenue increases. The company is experiencing significant profit growth due to persistent increases in payment volumes, cross-border transactions, and ongoing technology investments. The continuing shift towards digital payments benefits Visa. A solid cash position allows the company to enhance shareholder value.

Based on my fair price estimate, Visa is projected to yield higher returns than the S&P 500 in the next five years (projected CAGR is 14.7%). The current price is 12.18% lower than my Fair Price Basic Case estimate.

1dk6foo_V,V,$CAD.V DD post,"**DD $CAD.V**

Colonial Coal International Corp, TSX-V and OTC US markets, the Canadian coal rocket. 

Developer of metallurgical coal (met coal).

This is not advice, do your own research (material at bottom)



**Disclosure:** 

I own around 65K of $CAD.V, average price $2.103

Been buying into this since $1.58

  


**What in tarnation is met coal?**

Met coal is a component in production of high quality coke, used in steel production. Global demand for coking coal has been increasing, and continues to do so.

The quality of met coal is graded from highest to lowest:



1)Hard coking coal 

2) Semi-soft coking coal

3) Pulverized coal injection



**Thermal coal** on the other hand is more polluting, and does not produce coke. Thermal is used for energy production. Thermal is facing negative attention in media, politics, ESG etc. because of this, and is also in competition with green alternatives.

Thermal coal accounts for more the 90% of the global consumption. 



Demand for met coal is therefore going to exist far into the foreseeable future, and is not threatened by renewable energy developments.



Furthermore, governments investing into infrastructure to beef economy -> More demand for met coal.



Therefore, in my opinion, met coal is nice.



**The properties**

Colonial owns a 100% stake in two resource-stage properties in BC, Canada.

Flatbed and Huguenot.

These are both logistically well located in relation to ports facilitating transport to Asia, the world no. 1 importer of met coal.



**The Coal**

Apprx.

Flatbed: 298 Mt inferred 

Huguenot: 277.7 Mt Measured & indicated + 119.2 Mt inferred.



All hard coking coal (the highest quality) and NI 43-101 compliant.

As per oct. 2022 CEO David Austin claimed that they have only drilled out around 20%, and that there's “an awful lot of blue-sky potential left”.



I could yap on about the coal, but i recommend reading the 2024 investor presentation, containing many more details on the specifics of the coal, logistics and market situation in the BC coal industry.



**The sale.**

$CAD is led by CEO and founder David Austin, who previously founded and sold Western Coal Corp. (CAD$3.3 billion) as well as being behind sale of Northern Energy and Mining (CAD$400M).



Since 2019 Colonial have been seeking a buyer for the 2 properties.

This is where I believe there’s money to be made for investors.



During covid negotiations have slowed down, but recently momentum has been regained. This has been reflected in the share price, currently sitting at 2.45$CAD.

https://preview.redd.it/famfbjpbqo7d1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae04df51bd586040b40883a6accbefbf40c038c1

  


Since the canadian travel ban was lifted in sep 2022, there has been a steady stream of potential buyers visiting David, and well as the man himself going abroad to meet possible investors. 



More than 10 NDA’s have been signed, and amongst potential buyers are Anglo, Nippon steel and CitiBank.



A first bid seems long overdue, and should come any moment.



**Valuation**



Based on the current market cap of \~441.54M CAD, we get a price of \~ 0.64 CAD/ton (as per. 10-06-24). 

441.54/695 = 0.6353

This is undervalued (opinion).



**Comparable sales:**

Hancock prospecting -> \~$2.68/t ($740M)

Bathrust -> \~$1.89/t ($89M)

Thus giving us an avg. of \~$2.3/t.



I’m not gonna speculate too much on the exact evaluation, but the above number seems in line with what I hear from other investors. More optimistic valuations, including CEO David, are closer to $3/t.



If we go with $2,5/t, that gives a share price of:

 

695Mt \* US$ 2.5/t \* 1.38 = CA$ 2397.75M



2397.75M / 180.3M = CA$ 13.29

Estimated pps @ US$ 2.5/t = CA$ 13.29



I rest my case with this nice graph, courtesy of [Phillip Gunst](https://www.ccoal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/colonial-corporate-presentation-2024-01-24.pdf). As you can see, the line goes up.

Now the question remains, when will the first bid land, and will it start a bidding war?

Teck resources are expecting a close sale of their steel-making unit to Glencore by Q3, this will definately be an event to watch out for.



I recommend people to do their own research, read the investor presentation and canaccord report below to get a better understanding of the market before buying in.

(TSXV: NRX) (OTCQB: NRXBF) (Germany: J90)** (the “Company” or “NurExone”), a pioneering biopharmaceutical company developing regenerative medicine therapies, is pleased to announce its financial and operational results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the highlights of which are included in this news release. The Company’s full set of consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and accompanying management’s discussion and analysis can be accessed by visiting the Company’s website at www.nurexone.com and its profile page on SEDAR+ at [www.sedarplus.ca](https://www.sedarplus.ca).

**Key Business Highlights**

On March 1, 2024, the Company commenced the setup of in-house laboratories and offices to bolster its research and development capabilities, subsequent to entering into lease and construction agreements. Completion of these initiatives is anticipated by the end of June 2024.

On March 22, 2024, the Company completed the acceleration of 12,682,340 warrants issued pursuant to a private placement of units that closed on June 15, 2022. Following the acceleration event, the Company received gross proceeds of US$2.92 million (approximately C$4.0 million) from the exercise of 10,423,629 common share purchase warrants, which represented accelerated and non-accelerated warrants of which 9,684,993 warrants were exercised at a price of C$0.38, 556,818 warrants were exercised at a price of C$0.34, and 181,818 warrants were exercised at a price of C$0.48. The Company exercised its right to accelerate the expiry date of certain warrants to thirty days upon the Company’s common shares exceeded C$0.475 for ten consecutive trading days on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”). “We appreciate the confidence of the investors who exercise their warrants, and the ongoing support of NurExone’s journey,” stated Eran Ovadya, NurExone Chief Financial Officer.

On April 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Contract Research Organization services agreement with Vivox Ltd. for animal experiments as part of the preclinical testing phase for the submission of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). This is aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of the ExoPTEN drug before proceeding to clinical trials involving human subjects, which are anticipated to commence in 2025. This engagement followed the completion of a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA regarding the manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical development plan of ExoPTEN, NurExone’s inaugural ExoTherapy product, and the subsequent receipt of a written response from the FDA.

On April 25, 2024, NurExone successfully secured approval for listing on the OTCQB Venture Market, marking a significant milestone in the Company's growth and visibility within the financial community, including in the USA. In addition, the Company achieved Depository Trust Company eligibility, which enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of trading NurExone shares, facilitating better liquidity and broader access for investors.

**Growth Outlook for 2024**

According to Chief Executive Officer Dr. Lior Shaltiel, “NurExone is committed to pioneering transformations in the field of regenerative medicine with new, minimally invasive therapies and we are moving along the regulatory path towards human trials for our first product, ExoPTEN. Our focus remains on enhancing our ExoTherapy platform for the production of nanodrugs, expanding our intellectual property, and forging strategic collaborations. Towards this end, we have recently engaged Dr. Ram Petter, Vice President and head of Bio Strategy at Teva Pharmaceutical, to support our efforts in collaborating with biopharma companies.”

**First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results**

Research and development expenses were US$0.22 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to US$0.37 million in the same quarter in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the receipt of a governmental grant of US$0.02 and reductions in stock-based compensation of US$0.08, subcontractor and materials expenses of US$0.05.

General and administrative expenses were US$0.70 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to US$0.35 million in the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to costs related to public and investor relations services.

Finance expenses were US$0.01 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to finance income of US$0.01 million in the same period in 2023, driven by income from bank interest.

Net loss was US$0.92 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of US$0.70 million in the first quarter of 2023.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of US$3.25 million (December 31, 2023 - US$0.54 million) and working capital of US$3.31 million (December 31, 2023 - US$0.07 million). The increase in cash was primarily due to the completion of a private placement in January 2024 for gross proceeds of approximately US$1.49 million and the exercise of warrants in March 2024 for gross proceeds of approximately US$2.92 million.

The Company had an accumulated deficit of US$14.98 million as of March 31, 2024, (December 31, 2023 - US$14.06 million).

Eran Ovadya, NurExone’s Chief Financial Officer, added: “The Company maintains a strong cash position, ensuring sufficient funding until year-end. With strategic oversight, we navigate our business plan amidst ongoing activities, positioning ourselves for sustained growth and continued success.”

1dgzj7q_V,V,IRL V vs MA Investment Research/Experiment,"Context: One of the ways I make money during the summer is at my summer job, where I oversee a few other employees at a mini golf/driving range/batting cage place. My main job is not to work registers but I do help a little bit on them. 

I have been wanting to invest in one of either V or MA but I was unsure which to choose. So today I had the idea to take a tally of every debit/credit card I got to see which type people were using, basically the parking lot test for debit/credit cards. There were purchases today ranging from $8-$300

This was in a 3.5 hour span and wasn’t nearly all the customers that came, just all the customers I was on a register for. I had 54 total tally marks. With the following results,

Visa - 62.9%
Mastercard- 29.6%
AMEX - 7.4%

I was curious what my results looked like compared to the market share I could find online. The market share I found online was 

Visa - 61.1%
Mastercard - 25.4%
AMEX - 11.3%
Discover - 2.1%

This was pretty similar to the results I found in my small sample size which I thought was cool.

This lead me to the question, which company should I invest in? MA or V? I originally thought V because they are the most popular card and have the most expensive transactions (not in my data but found on the website I found the market share - statista). But then I thought about MA because of the greater opportunity to increase market share. V would be better if the market grows but MA would be more feasible if the market is stagnant is what I was originally thinking.

I haven’t looked into financials or anything like that yet I was just going off of reasoning and other data so far, but basically the whole point of this long post was to share my experiment and ask if you like V or MA more as a long term investment (I’m 17 so I have 30-50 year window).

1df4wvt_V,V,"NurExone Announces Expansion of ExoPTEN Patent Coverage with Notice of Allowance for Japanese Patent Application (TSXV: NRX, OTCQB: NRXBF, FSE: J90, NRX.V)","TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, June 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX), (OTCQB: NRXBF), (Germany: J90) (the “Company” or “NurExone”), a pioneering biopharmaceutical company developing regenerative medicine therapies, is pleased to announce that the Japan Patent Office recently issued a Notice of Allowance for an ExoPTEN patent, covering innovative Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) comprising a phosphatase and tensin homolog (“PTEN”) inhibitor and their application use. The Company’s ExoPTEN drug, currently under development, aims to promote nerve growth and regeneration after acute spinal cord injury by inhibiting the PTEN protein.  
The patent, titled “Vesicles Comprising a PTEN Inhibitor and Uses of Same”, was originally submitted by the Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. (“Technion”) and Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. It is the first patent licensed by NurExone from Technion and describes a fundamental element of the Company’s ExoPTEN nanodrug under development for acute spinal cord injury.  
Dr. Bat-Ami Gotliv, Patent Attorney for NurExone, stated, “The allowance of this patent application in Japan safeguards NurExone’s technology in a vital Asian market. This approval, alongside the corresponding patents granted in the United States of America and Russia, underscores the novelty and inventive step of NurExone’s technology.”  
Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone, explained, “This patent, which belongs to the ExoPTEN family in our extensive IP portfolio, is included in the exclusive worldwide licensing from the Technion. We are making progress using ExoPTEN, our first nanodrug, and other newly developed technologies as we move towards clinical trials in humans and commercialization.”  
Mr. Yoram Drucker, Co-Founder, Chairman and VP Strategic Development, elaborated, “We see Japan as an important territory for our products and technology. This expands our potential market to the Far East, and if we succeed in showing benefits in other Central Nerve System indications, we may dramatically increase our market potential.”  
A Notice of Allowance represents the final stage prior to the grant, pending the Company’s payment of the registration fees.  
Amending and Extension Agreement with BullVestor  
Further to the Company’s press release dated January 17, 2024, the Company and bullVestor Medien GmbH (“BullVestor”) have entered into an amending agreement (the “Amending Agreement”) to the investor relations agreement dated January 9, 2024 (the “IR Agreement”) pursuant to which BullVestor will continue to provide investor relations services to the Company until May 15, 2025, at a monthly rate of C$59,000. The Amending Agreement is subject to TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) approval. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Amending Agreement, either party may terminate the IR Agreement on 15 days’ notice.  
Under the IR Agreement, as amended, BullVestor assists with and enhances awareness of the Company’s products and services using advertising and communications, some of which may constitute investor relations activities pursuant to the policies of the TSXV. The advertising and communications will occur in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland).  
The consideration does not include any securities of the Company. BullVestor does not have any interest, directly or indirectly, in the Company or its securities, or any right or intent to acquire such an interest.  
Aside from the IR Agreement, as amended, the Company does not have any relationship with BullVestor. BullVestor is located in Austria.

The latest key development is that the Company welcomed Dr. Ram Petter, Ph.D., MBA, as a consultant to assist in driving the Company’s strategic collaborations. This new ‘acquisition’ showcases NRX’s desire to increase its partnerships and licensing.

Dr. Petter’s bona fides include:

* Senior Biotechnological / Biopharmaceutical professional with 25 years in leadership positions with increasing responsibility. Significant experience in Bio Operations, Manufacturing, R&D, Strategic Planning, Portfolio Development, Business Development, General Management (P&L responsibility), Commercial negotiations and alliance management across multiple cultures and geographies.
* Creative & and focused thinking, daring and driven by challenges
* Enthusiastic with the development of organizations, teams and talented individuals
* Played leading roles in developing, submitting, approving, launching, and commercial manufacturing of Novel and Biosimilar products. (Linkedin)

“Our ExoTherapy platform for drug delivery is ready for industry partnerships targeting clinical indications beyond acute spinal cord injury,” says Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone. “Ram’s extensive experience and strategic acumen will be most helpful in forging these critical collaborations.” Adding someone with such experience in pharmaceuticals and the business side is likely a game changer for NRX.

I also found a great article that digs into the company to give confidence to buy some potentially. A few highlights of the NATURE piece;

* At the forefront of developing exosomes into next-generation nanocarriers for drug delivery.
* Exosomes play an essential biological role in intercellular communication and transmission of macromolecules between cells.
* Vehicles for the delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), from small molecules and peptides to proteins and nucleic acids, as an alternative to other kinds of nanocarriers such as lipid vesicles and cell-based gene therapies.
* They do not elicit the immune solid responses that often hamper allogeneic cell-based therapies, which are used to deliver therapeutic molecules and genes to patients.
* NurExone’s ambitious goal is to market a novel treatment for acute spinal cord injuries (SCIs) derived from the ExoTherapy platform, ExoPTEN.
* NurExone’s ambitious goal is to market a novel treatment for acute spinal cord injuries (SCIs) derived from the ExoTherapy platform, ExoPTEN.

NRX seems to be making all the right moves product-wise and maintaining a robust program of partnerships and licensing. The company’s Orphan Drug status is extremely helpful.  

“The orphan drug designation provides significant benefits to pharmaceutical companies developing drugs for rare diseases, i.e. those impacting fewer than 200,000 people in the United Statesii. These benefits include market exclusivity, financial incentives, regulatory assistance, and support with drug development. Overall, the designation incentivizes and supports the development of certain treatments, increasing access to therapies for patients.” 

The latest initiative is the development of NRX-101, an FDA-designated investigational Breakthrough Therapy for suicidal treatment-resistant bipolar depression and chronic pain.

Here’s an exciting article delineating the USD68 billion potential of Orphan drugs and NRX’s potential in that scenario.

1cztp3c_V,V,What do you think about HANK.V (Hank Payments)?,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HANK.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HANK.V)

This company had great latest financial statements which suggest that it's very likely that in the next quarter (earnings will be shared in around a week) it will become **profitable!** 

However the market seems to be spotting some risks that I don't. Of course it has low cash on hand and huge debt, but this is normal for a penny stock.

* Revenue: CA$1.92m (up 27% from 2Q 2023).
* Net loss: CA$285.5k (loss narrowed by 61% from 2Q 2023).
* CA$0.004 loss per share (improved from CA$0.01 loss in 2Q 2023). -> This is the biggest highlight IMHO. \~75% reduction in losses.

The majority of the company's debt is long term and it's getting financed via selling of notes/bonds and **not** stocks which favors long term investing.

It's stupid cheap at just $4-5M depending on the day.

It's not a traditional bank, as it doesn't provide loans. Instead of helps it's customers manage and repair faster their existing loans, and gets on average $10 monthly fee per customer. It's a ""Bank as a Service"" business model.

**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

* Record revenue for the quarter of $1.91 MM, an increase of 21% over the September 2023 quarter and 27% growth over the same quarter in 2022;
* Adjusted loss from operations of $146,221 representing over 70% improvement as compared to the September 2023 quarter;
* Quarterly Canadian licensee revenues of over $500,000 during the quarter which is the minimum quarterly licensing fee to continue through the multi-year term of the agreement;
* Strong Gross Margins Exceeding 90%.

**BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS**

* Three US colleges contracted during the quarter for the Hank EDU platform with several more colleges engaged and contract announcements expected on an ongoing quarterly basis;
* Several colleges completing their integration phase and launching in the coming months;
* Material rebound in the auto sector delivered over 11% growth for the year with a 39% surge in customer enrolments in the month of December;
* Large dealer groups continued to be signed with launches expected in the coming quarters; and
* Strategic investments received subsequent to the quarter end from market development partners for two new products expected to launch this year, Hank Equity Builder and Hank Doors.

**HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2023**

* March 2023, Hank announced the signing of a national technology license agreement with an initial term of three years comprising a minimum base revenue of $5 million plus 22% maintenance for a total of $6.1 million in revenue to be earned over the term. For the first quarter ending September 30, 2023, $169,444 of licensing revenue was recognized representing one month of licensing revenue which will be reported and earned at a rate of $508,332 per quarter going forward over three years, significantly increasing future revenue and earnings;
* Most recent quarter ending September 30, 2023, saw the adjusted loss decline by 25% to $507,797 and quarterly gross margins remaining strong at 89%;
* October 2023, the Company announced a partnership with Ingo Money to power instant disbursements initially for Hank's education platform (""Hank EDU""). Hank EDU includes a product called Fast Funds that enables seamless instant disbursements to students, saving time and money while enabling compliance with strict legal requirements around distributions of funds for students;
* Investment in expanding the Education EDU sales team yielded results with three new colleges signed in 2023; and
* Thirty-two new Auto Dealership partners were added throughout 2023 contributing to a 39% surge in new customer enrollments for the month of December in comparison to December 2022.

Can you think of a better penny stock selling this cheap for the huge potential of becoming profitable this year? Also the stock price has dropped with around 70% this year with ZERO NEGATIVE NEWS!

The biggest risk is if the company becomes insolvent, but with the low interest rates on it's debt (since it's noted/bonds), and the $5M revenue bonus (on a high profit margin), and additional financing for each subscribed customer, and some private equity investments from time to time (looking at the older news in Yahoo) it looks like bankruptcy isn't that close.",2024-05-24,3,1

NurExone (TSXV:NRX, OTC:NRXBF) is a biotech company specializing in Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) that holds significant potential for investors. Why? Firstly, let me explain. With its robust pipeline portfolio, rapid advancement, and strong analyst projections, NurExone is positioned for success. While the current share price hovers around $0.60, Litchfield Firms, a reputable research entity, has set a price target of $4.00 for NurExone’s shares! It’s evident that the company is credible, and disregarding this opportunity would be akin to fumbling a pass from Tom Brady. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers; the Super Bowl victory is within reach.

**What is Behind NurExone’s Future Success?** 

Exosomes, tiny cell-secreted particles, are big news in medicine for their ability to carry healing treatments. NurExone (TSXV:NRX, OTC:NRXBF) is at the forefront, using exosomes to create ExoTherapy, a cutting-edge way to deliver drugs. Their star product, ExoPTEN, targets healing and recovery in people with spinal cord injuries, a breakthrough that even the FDA recognizes with Orphan Drug Designation, a special status for crucial treatments.

NurExone’s ExoTherapy isn’t just a lucky guess—it’s the result of years of hard work and smart research. By tapping into the power of exosomes, they’re making sure treatments hit the right spots, improving outcomes for patients. Plus, they’ve got the exclusive rights to top-notch research from prestigious institutions like the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology and Tel Aviv University. It’s no wonder they’re leading the pack in exosome-based medicine.

Since early March, the company entered into another whole dimension with significant updates: 

* On March 1, 2024, the Company began setting up its own labs and offices to boost its research and development efforts, after finalizing lease and construction deals. These initiatives are expected to be finished by the end of June 2024.
* Then, on March 22, 2024, the company announced its involvement in animal experiments conducted by a Contract Research Organization (CRO). This is part of the preclinical testing phase for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. The goal is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ExoPTEN drug before moving on to clinical trials with humans, which are planned to start in 2025. This engagement follows a Pre-Investigational New Drug (“Pre-IND”) meeting with the FDA, where the manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical development plan for ExoPTEN, NurExone’s first ExoTherapy product, was discussed and a written response from the FDA was received.

Here is what Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone said:

*“Our emphasis on research and development in 2023, coupled with the expansion of our Intellectual Property (“IP”) portfolio, the ODD for ExoPTEN, and the growth of the ExoTherapy platform, are laying the groundwork for the accelerated introduction of minimally invasive regenerative medicine.”*  


Eran Ovadya, CFO of NurExone, also said: 

*“Due to the ongoing support and confidence of our investors, the Company is confident that its current total existing funds, augmented by the recently completed exercise of warrants, will support ongoing operating activities through the end of 2024.”*

**Ovadya mentioned warrants and funds. But how are they?** 

**Nurexone closed $4M thanks to its warrants**   
NurExone (TSXV:NRX, OTC:NRXBF)  recently finalized the exercise and expiration of its common share purchase warrants, originally issued in a June 2022 private placement. After meeting predefined criteria outlined in a September 28, 2023 press release, 9,684,993 warrants were exercised, yielding C$3,680,297 in gross proceeds. Additionally, 2,997,347 warrants expired unexercised.

In parallel, NurExone saw gross proceeds of C$276,591 from the exercise of warrants not subject to acceleration. These proceeds originated from two distinct groups: 556,818 warrants from a September 2023 private placement with an exercise price of C$0.34, and 181,818 warrants from another September 2023 private placement with an exercise price of C$0.48. This strategic maneuver reflects NurExone’s commitment to optimizing shareholder value and seizing favorable market conditions.

**Expenses and Funds**

* In 2023, research and development (R&D) expenses totaled US$1.54 million, up from US$1.39 million in 2022. This increase of US$0.15 million was primarily due to extensive efforts in developing ExoPTEN technology and other siRNA targets.
* General and administrative (G&A) expenses were US$2.12 million in 2023, down from US$4.15 million in 2022. The decrease of US$2.03 million was mainly due to reduced professional services related to the transition to a listed public company in 2022.
* Listing expenses were absent in 2023, compared to US$2.08 million in 2022, associated with a reverse takeover transaction.
* Financial income/expenses, net, shifted from an expense of US$0.55 million in 2022 to income of US$0.02 million in 2023, primarily due to non-cash expenses related to warrant and royalty liability valuation in 2022.
* The net loss decreased to US$3.64 million in 2023 from US$8.17 million in 2022, with reductions in G&A and listing expenses being key factors.
* As of December 31, 2023, the company’s cash and equivalents stood at US$0.54 million, down from US$2.46 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to net cash used in operating activities, partially offset by proceeds from private placements and a grant from the Israeli Innovation Authority.
* Additionally, the company secured US$1.20 million in restricted cash as of December 31, 2023, associated with a private placement completed in January 2024.

NurExone is currently in the dynamic stages of research, development, and expansion. While we haven’t introduced any products to the market or generated significant revenue yet, we’re actively working towards those goals. We’re optimistic about our future and are committed to achieving profitability. To support our endeavors, we will continue to explore opportunities for financing through equity or debt until we reach our objectives.

1cg9q7c_JPM,JPM,"VISA and JPM, 2 companies for 2 economic scenarios","Disclaimer I held a position in Visa and a smaller one in JP Morgan for a couple years, and plan on adding some shares in the next few days

1. Rates cuts and higher inflation = great time for VISA.
A expansionary monetary policy would increase consumer spending in real terms, and accelarate nominal spending even higher because of inflation. Both of these trends would benefit VISA, since it has great pricing power and charges a fixed percentage on any transaction. VISA has little need for capital, so an increase in nominal spending would boost revenues while inflation is unlikely to affect his costs, thus further expanding it's already incredible margins. I believe the transition away from cash to card would be accelarated, both because of less cash in the wallet and the advantages of financing purchases at lower rates.
I think visa could return 15% y/y in this situation, with 12 free cash flow growth and FCY of 3%.
The only risk I see are slower growth (current PE of 30) and governament regualtions.

2. High rates low inflation = great time for JPM. In this situation JP Morgan chase would probably be able to expand its balance sheet, because of people moving their asset into JPM from smaller and riskier banks, as well as Aquistions of distressed banks very short on liquidity. In addition, the Bank would be able to employ this capital at high rates, and increase its credit spread substantially. All of this should lead to massive profits, putting JPM fortress balance sheet in an enviable position, like we saw in 2022.
I'm this scenario I think 15% returns are possible ( 6% free cash flow growth and 9% FCY)
The main risk I see is a fall in CIB revenues and some losses on the asset side (few distressed loans and marking to market some bonds with high duration)

The financial sector is historically quite risky, and prudence is key when investing, however I think these companies will do great is some scenario, and good in others, and survive in all but the most tragic ones, thus MAY offer and interesting Risk/Reward proposition.

* Exosomes have the natural ability to find inflamed tissue in the body
* Exosomes can be loaded with drugs
* Because of their small size, exosomes can also penetrate the brain, which is usually difficult (blood/brain barrier).
* Exosomes can “feel” inflammation through their receptors and dock there
* Damaged cells swallow up the exosomes along with their drug load.
* Our technology can be the solution to one of the main neurological problems - getting the active ingredient to the right place in the brain.
* If the exosomes do not find damaged tissues, they are simply excreted in the urine.
* There are no immune reactions of the body to exosomes
* We have invented a new loading method and applied for a patent
* We can completely control the loading, both what we load and how much we load

**Nurexone Biologic Inc.\***

WKN: A3DNSU , TSXV: NRX

**Nurexone Biologic Inc.\* (NASDAQ:** **NUR** **)** is a TSX-V listed pharmaceutical company developing a platform for biologically controlled exotherapy using exosomes as a next-generation drug delivery system. The company's first product, ExoPTEN, targets neuronal regeneration and recovery in patients who have suffered an acute spinal cord injury.

Notably, ExoPTEN has received orphan drug designation from the Food and Drug Administration, underscoring its potential importance for these patients. The company has an exclusive worldwide license from the Technion and Tel Aviv University to develop and commercialize the technology.

**The EUREKA Commission seems Equally Enthusiastic:**

Eureka was launched back in 1985 as an agreement between 18 countries and the European Commission to promote competitiveness and market integration and support collaboration in research and development. Since then, Eureka has expanded to 47 countries supporting organizations with national funding.

**Developing Drugs of the Future with EXSOSOMES**

Exosomes, on whose use the technology of **Nurexone Biologic Inc.\* (WKN:** **A3DNSU** **)** is based, are particles that are created, among other things, by the proliferation of stem cells. An outstanding property of exosomes is that they can stimulate the body's own regenerative processes after injuries or in acute phases of an illness. For example, exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells have been found to activate multiple processes important for bone fracture repair and wound healing. These exosomes are also involved in the regulation of immune-mediated responses and anti-inflammatory processes. Exosome research is considered the holy grail for numerous diseases and that is why a lot of capital is being invested:

* Roche ( SIX: ROG ) is investing $36 million in Puretech ( NASDAQ: PRTC ) - up to $1 billion in milestone payments and royalties
* Takeda ( TOKYO:4502 ) will pay $44 million for the collaboration with Evox - up to $838 million in Meileinstein payments and royalties
* Eli Lilly ( NYSE: LLY ) will pay $20 million to work with Evox - up to $1.2 billion in Meileinstein payments and royalties

**Nurexone - Exopten nasal spray cures paraplegia?**

In the technology from **Nurexone Biologic Inc.\* (WKN:** **A3DNSU** **),** the exosomes are used as “carriers” that have modified siRNA in them. To put it simply, the exosomes find the damaged nerve cords and the modified siRNA is responsible for healing.

In preclinical animal studies using a completely transected spinal cord, intranasal administration of ExoPTEN resulted in significant motor improvement, sensory recovery, and faster recovery of the urinary reflex.

**Functional Restoration**

https://preview.redd.it/v8zbzotfgxqc1.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b9fcab006996d1fbdbe3fdbdd8908b9c1ef02bc

The MRI clearly shows almost complete recovery of the severed spinal cord. This can also be seen in an impressive video. The rat, whose spinal cord was previously severed, regained its motor skills after treatment with ExoPTEN.

**Conclusion:**

Wouldn't you be tempted to call this technology a miracle now that you know the video and the facts. I think so - but a miracle is often only a one-time thing and **Nurexone Biologic Inc.\* (WKN:** **A3DNSU** **)** is working to make this miracle reproducible as often as desired and I am firmly convinced that this can be achieved and that ExoPTEN will become the standard -Treatment for paraplegia can be done.

Bull Case:

Bitcoin has a 4 year cycle, centered around the halving event.  Here is a list of the low to high price after each halving. 

2012 Halving: $12.40

13 months later: $1,170

2016 Halving: $535

18 months later: $19,400

2020 Halving: $8,590

18 months later: $69,000

There are diminishing returns each cycle, so the first one was about 95x, second cycle was 35x and the third cycle was 8x.  As you can see, this next cycle should be around 2-3x from the price at the halving, but the halving isn't until next month and we are already at $73,000.  Let's just go with the current price, the peak should be $146,000 - $219,000 per Bitcoin around 18 months from now.

Bear Case:

* **Prices for nickel are down around 30% because of oversupply from Indonesia.**
* **The automobile industry could play a key role in helping develop nickel deposits in North America.**

*Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify the Alaska Energy Metals CEO’s comments on automotive companies.*

Nickel prices are tanking and that’s hurting companies’ exploration efforts, according to **Alaska Energy Metals** **AKEMF** CEO **Greg Beischer**.

""It makes it harder to raise capital because the commodity is out of favor in investors' eyes,"" Beischer told Benzinga.

With a low stock price, he added, “if we sell shares, that's expensive capital. It dilutes our shareholders.""

The world's nickel mines are divided into two types of deposits—sulfide and laterite. Sulfide deposits offer easier extraction while laterite deposits require more energy and chemicals.

Because of a lack of exploration in recent years, high-grade sulfide deposits are becoming depleted. Low-grade sulfide deposits offer an alternative to the more-polluting laterite deposits in Indonesia.

**‘Low Nickel Prices Drive Mines Out Of Business’**

Prices for nickel—a key material in stainless steel production and electric vehicle (EV) batteries—are down around 30% over the past year because of oversupply from Indonesian nickel mines. Tempered growth forecasts for electric vehicles (EVs) have also helped pressure prices. 

But with the tanking nickel price, these low-grade sulfide deposits are becoming uneconomical, making it harder for developers to bring them into production, Beischer said.

""There's going to be projects like ours that are discovered and advanced that are going to have difficulty getting financed while the nickel price is low,"" he said. ""At a low nickel price, it starts to drive some existing mines out of business.""

Alaska Energy Metals is developing its Nikolai nickel sulfide project on the southern flank of the Alaska Range about 124 miles southeast of Fairbanks.

North American and European nickel users should reject nickel produced in a way that creates a net detriment to the environment, even when end uses such as EVs are considered in the equation, he said.

""They can't really look themselves in the face by purchasing metals that are being produced in a manner that's anything but environmentally friendly,"" he said.

The automobile industry could play a key role in helping develop nickel deposits in North America, which has strong environmental and regulatory frameworks, he said. 

""They are going to have a much stronger lobby than the mining industry could ever have,"" he said. 

That will be needed to help burnish the mining industry's image, as the industry is still viewed by the messes it made in the old days instead of the modern methods employed among North American miners nowadays, he said.

Automakers such as **General Motors Co.** and **Tesla Inc** have been investing in mining companies or contracting with them to secure supplies of electric vehicle metals, including nickel. **Ford Motor Co.** Last year said it would take a stake in a plant under construction in Indonesia that will supply nickel chemicals for electric vehicle batteries.

“Car companies and mining companies should collaborate, and the government should save its money, but the government should also have pro-mining development policies to go with their electrification agenda,"" Beischer said.

The U.S. has ceded metal supply chains to other nations, but at the same time isn't particularly friendly to mining companies even though a lot of minerals will need to be produced to support the nation's electrification ambitions, he said. 

""There seems to be a disconnect,"" he said. ""The permitting agencies still move very slowly.""

The mining industry doesn't want to see environmental regulations rolled back in the U.S., he said. Rather, it would like to see the timeline for environmental reviews sped up, he added.

""Just make the industry feel welcome encourage mine development,"" Beischer said. ""Have the permitting agencies move at a faster rate. We've got to get this done.""

Alaska Energy Metals shares are currently up about 1.36%, trading at 29 cents on last check.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

* The Eureka West and Eureka East deposits reported in the maiden 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) are now connected as one deposit measuring 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) in length.
* Relative to the maiden MRE:  

   * A significant portion of the deposit was upgraded from Inferred to Indicated MRE. Previously there was 0 tonnes of Indicated resource. There has been an addition of 813 million tonnes of Indicated resource to the MRE.
   * The grade of the Indicated resource is 0.29% nickel equivalent (“NiEq”).
   * The Inferred resource has increased from 319.6 million tonnes to 896 million tonnes, a 180% increase. The grade of the Inferred resource is 0.27% NiEq.
   * There has been an addition of 3.877 billion pounds (1.758 million tonnes) of contained nickel to the Indicated resource.
   * There has been an increase in Inferred resource contained nickel metal from 1.552 billion pounds (703,975 tonnes) to 4.225 billion pounds (1.916 million tonnes), a 172% increase.
* As a consequence of joining the two deposits together, the strip ratio has been reduced from 3.7:1 to 1.5:1. Three parallel zones of mineralization are now identified (EZ1, EZ2, and EZ3).
* A higher-grade core zone has been identified within EZ2 and it shows continuity along much of the strike of the deposit. The higher-grade core contains an Indicated resource of 211 million tonnes at a grade of 0.34% NiEq and an Inferred resource of 154 million tonnes at a grade of 0.33% NiEq.

**THE MRE now stands at:**

***Indicated*** **MRE:**

813 million tonnes grading 0.29% NiEq containing:

3,877 million pounds (1.758 million tonnes) of nickel

1,276 million pounds (578,783 tonnes) of copper

303 million pounds (137,438 tonnes) of cobalt

4.0 million ounces of platinum, plus palladium and gold

***Inferred*** **MRE:**

896 million tonnes grading 0.27% NiEq containing:

4,225 million pounds (1.916 million tonnes) of nickel

1,040 million pounds (471,736 tonnes) of copper

327 million pounds (148,324 tonnes) of cobalt

3.4 million ounces of platinum, plus palladium and gold

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC, OTCQB: AKEMF) (“AEMC” or the “Company”) announced today an updated independent mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 *Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects* (“NI 43-101”) (“2024 MRE” or “2024 Resource”) for its 100% owned Eureka Deposit, Nikolai Nickel Project (“Nikolai” or “Deposit”) in Alaska, USA, with an effective date of February 12, 2023.

The newly-published 2024 MRE contains an addition of 813 million tonnes of indicated resource, 896 million tonnes of inferred resource (an increase of 180%), and a strip ratio decrease, when compared with the maiden resource published in 2023 (see press release dated November 20, 2023). The study was completed by Stantec Consulting Services, Inc., and includes 35 historical drill holes, the data for which the Company purchased in August 2023, and eight diamond drill holes (totaling 4,138 meters) drilled by the Company on the project in 2023.

Alaska Energy Metals President & CEO Gregory Beischer commented, *“In less than a year, we have taken an exploration concept to a substantial deposit of nickel and other critical metals. The mineral resource estimate update has produced a 180% increase in the Inferred tonnage, and added substantial, new Indicated tonnage to the deposit. The update increases the nickel metal content of the deposit to over 8 billion pounds (more than 3.7 million metric tonnes) with only a 0.01% grade decrease and a notably lower strip ratio. With this updated mineral resource estimate, the Eureka deposit of the Nikolai Nickel project represents a globally significant accumulation of nickel and has now become one of the larger known nickel deposits in the United States. Nikolai could potentially become an important source of nickel for the USA, catering to the needs of various manufacturing sectors including stainless steel, electric vehicles, defense components, long-term, grid-scale renewable energy storage batteries and a myriad of other uses. This significant achievement speaks volumes to the hard work our team has put into the project over the past year. I am particularly encouraged by the delineation of a higher-grade core zone. The presence of this core zone could dramatically affect project economics in a positive way.”*

**Nikolai Mineral Resource Estimate Update**

* Total ***Indicated*** mineral resources of 3.877 billion pounds (1.758 million tonnes) of nickel, 1.276 billion pounds (578,783 tonnes) of copper, and 303 million pounds (137,438 tonnes) of cobalt, plus a total of 4.0 million ounces of platinum, plus palladium and gold in a constrained model totaling 813 million tonnes, at an average grade of 0.29% total NiEq, using a 0.20% NiEq cut-off grade. See detailed breakdown in Tables 1, 2, and 3 below.
* Total ***Inferred*** mineral resources of 4.225 billion pounds (1.916 million tonnes) of nickel, 1.040 billion pounds (471,736 tonnes) of copper, and 327 million pounds (148,324 tonnes) of cobalt, plus a total of 3.4 million ounces of platinum, plus palladium and gold in a constrained model totaling 896 million tonnes, at an average grade of 0.27% total NiEq, using a 0.20% NiEq cut-off grade. See detailed breakdown in Tables 1, 2, and 3 below.
* A **higher-grade core zone** has been identified within EZ2, and it shows continuity along much of the strike of the deposit. The higher-grade core contains an Indicated resource of 211 million tonnes at a grade of 0.34% NiEq and an Inferred resource of 154 million tonnes at a grade of 0.33% NiEq. This zone will continue to be evaluated, as it could positively affect project economics
* The 2024 MRE represents a significant, material tonnage increase in the MRE for the Nikolai Nickel project compared to the maiden MRE (see press release dated November 20, 2023).
* The 2024 MRE is defined by 43 drill holes comprising 35 historic and eight holes drilled in 2023 by AEMC. The drill holes provide confirmation that mineralization is interconnected across all three domains. The deposits remain open along strike and in the down dip direction.
* The 2024 MRE incorporates three zones (EZ1, EZ2, EZ3) of sulfide mineralization that cover 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) of the Eureka deposit (Figure 1). The Eureka Zone East and Eureka Zone West MRE reported in the 2023 maiden MRE are now connected to form one continuous deposit.
* As a consequence of joining the two deposits together, the strip ratio was significantly decreased from 3.7:1 to 1.5:1.
* Chrome and iron are also present within the deposit but have not been reported in the 2024 Resource due to the lack of historical assay data and analytical methods used.

The 2024 MRE will be incorporated into a NI 43-101 compliant technical report for the Nikolai Nickel project to be filed within 45 days.

* NiEq = nickel equivalent, MT = million tonnes, Mlb = Million pounds, KtOz = thousand troy ounces.
* Totals may vary due to rounding.
* CIM definitions are followed for classification of Mineral Resource.
* Metal pricing used to calculate NiEq is based on observation of monthly metal pricing for the past 24 months up to end-January 2024 with Ni at US$23,375/tonne (US$10.6/lb) (World Bank), Cu at US$ 8,644/tonne ($US3.92/lb) (World Bank), Co 41,050 US$/tonne (US18.62/lb) (Trading Economics), Pt at US$963/toz (World Bank), Pd at US$1,664/toz (Kitco), and Au at 1,878 (World Bank). Totals may not represent the sum of the parts due to rounding.
* Nickel equivalent grade formula is as follows:  
\**NiEq = (Ni%) + (Cu% \* 0.31) + (Co% \* 1.46) + (Pt% \* 1,103) + (Pd% \* 1,907) + (Au% \* 2,153)*  
*Coefficients used to calculate the value of other metals to Ni equivalent include allowances for differences in assumed recoveries of other metals (50%) and nickel (60%), and are calculated as follows:*  
*(Metal Price)/(Ni Price) x (metal recovery/Ni recovery).*
* Base case NiEq cutoff grade is 0.20% calculated from a Ni price of US$23,375/tonne (US$10.60 US$/lb), surface mining cost of US$2.50 per tonne, processing costs US$25.00 per tonne and Ni recovery of 60% and 50% for other metals (Cu, Co, Pt, Pd, and Au).
* Mineral Resource are reported from within an economic pit shell whose extent has been estimated using a Ni price of US$23,374.56/tonne (US$10.60 US$/lb) and mining cost of US$2.50 per tonne, from a Ni equivalent grade calculated from Ni, Cu, Co, Pt, Pd, and Au, and 45-degree constant slope angle.
* The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared by Derek Loveday, P. Geo. of Stantec Consulting Services Inc. in conformity with CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices” guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators NI 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.

**SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS**  
A sensitivity analysis for Indicated and Inferred mineral resources are provided in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively, which demonstrates the variation in grade and tonnage in the deposit at various cut-off grades. Constrained Mineral Resources are reported at a base case cut-off grade of 0.20% NiEq. The values in the table reported above and below the cut-off grades should not be misconstrued with a Mineral Resource Statement. The values are only presented to show the sensitivity of the block model estimates to the selection of cut-off grade. All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate.

**MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION CALCULATION METHODOLOGY**  
The geologic model used for reporting of mineral resources is a 3D block model that was developed using LeapFrog Edge version 2023.1.1 and MinePlan version 16.1.1. The block model was developed using the UTM NAD83 6N and is in metric units. The block size is 40 m (X), 10 m (Y) and 10 m (Z) rotated by 26 degrees toward the east to align the X-axis along strike at 118 degrees. The block model captures three mineralized ultramafic intrusive bodies (“zones” or “solids”) that dip towards the southwest at between 45° and 50°. These three zones are called Eureka Zone 1 (EZ1), Eureka Zone 2 (EZ2) and Eureka Zone 3 (EZ3) from south to north across the deposit, respectively. The mineralized zones were built using Seequent’s Leapfrog Geo software from a drillhole database of 43 drillholes. Mineral sample assays have been validated for 36 of the 43 drillholes and assay data from these holes has been used to estimate grades for nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), gold (Au), silver (Ag), iron (Fe) and chromium (Cr). All metals, excluding Ag, Fe and Cr, have been used to calculate a NiEq grade based on average (24 month) market prices. Ag and Au grades were capped prior to estimation at 0.6 parts per million (ppm) for Ag and 0.03 ppm for Au within EZ1. Ni is approximately 77% of the total in-situ value of the metals included in the equivalent grade calculation.

Reasonable prospects for economic extraction have been determined by calculating a recovered NiEq cutoff grade of 0.20 percent (%) using the following assumptions:

* Mining costs US$2.5/tonne;
* Processing costs US$25/tonne;
* Processing recovery of 60%.

Resources are reported from within an economic pit shell at a 45-degree constant slope using Hexagon mining Pseudoflow algorithm. No underground mining is considered. Assumed revenue used to drive the pit shell is US$10.60/lb Ni applied to a recovered Ni-equivalent grade assuming 60% recovery for Ni and 50% recovery for all other metal equivalents. This pit optimization does not represent an economic study. Future engineering studies will be needed to develop optimal bulk tonnage mining methods. The pit-constrained MRE is at an indicated and inferred-level of assurance based in the quantity of exploration data available for grade estimation. Mineral resources are reported for the EZ1, EZ2 and EZ3.

The Nikolai Project MRE, with an effective date of February 12, 2024, is shown in Table 1 and associated grade sensitivity is shown in Table 2 and Table 3.

**MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE PREPARATION**  
The 2024 MRE has been prepared by Derek Loveday, P. Geo. (the “QP”) of Stantec Consulting Services Inc. in conformity with CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices” guidelines and are reported in accordance with NI 43-101. The QP is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio‐economic, marketing, political, or other relevant issues that could potentially affect the 2024 MRE. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.

**METALLURGY**  
All deposits in the 2024 Resource contain desirable nickel sulfide mineralization consisting of thick, layered horizons of nickel and copper sulfides, which are enriched in cobalt, chrome, iron, platinum, palladium, and gold. Preliminary deportment assessments for the Eureka Zone 2 mineralization have been completed by Pure Nickel Inc. in 2014 (see Pure Nickel’s press release dated April 22, 2014) and by the Company in 2022 (see press release dated September 29, 2022). Results from these two assessments (Table 4) indicate an average of 83.4% of the total nickel is in potentially recoverable mineral phases of Ni-sulfides and Ni-Fe alloys. The Company also analyzed copper deportment, with an average of 74% of the total copper in potentially recoverable mineral phases of Cu-sulfides and Cu-oxides. Additional deportment studies and bench scale metallurgical testing are on-going using core samples collected from the Company’s 2023 drill program. Results from these studies will be released when completed.

**CHROME AND IRON**  
Chrome and iron have been identified as potentially significant co-products of mineralization at the Nikolai Nickel Project. Data the Company purchased in August 2023 had incomplete iron assay data and the analytical methods used to determine the concentration of chrome prevented the assessment of these elements in the 2024 MRE. The drilling completed by the Company in 2023 indicated an increase from 0.18% to 0.28% in the mean chrome assays and an increase from 8.2% to 8.8% in the mean iron assays relative to the historical purchased data. AEMC will continue to evaluate the chrome and iron data from the 2024 infill drill program, which is currently being planned. The Company has the objective of integrating these elements in future resource updates.

**CAUTIONARY NOTE** **CONCERNING TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE AND U.S. SECURITIES LAWS**  
The MRE has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure requirements under United States securities laws. Unless otherwise indicated, all resource and reserve estimates included in this news release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. The definitions used in NI 43-101 are incorporated by reference from the CIM Definition Standards.

The SEC Modernization Rules replaced the historical disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7, which has been rescinded. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources”. Readers are cautioned that while the above terms are “substantially similar” to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that the Company may report as “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources” under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared mineral resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules. Accordingly, information contained or incorporated by reference in this news release describing the Company’s mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

The demand for copper is surging globally, primarily driven by its crucial role in the transition to renewable energy and the electrification of transportation systems. Copper's excellent electrical and thermal conductivity makes it a key component in electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems such as solar and wind farms, and the infrastructure required to support these technologies. As countries and industries strive to reduce carbon emissions and move towards more sustainable energy sources, the need for copper is expected to continue increasing dramatically.

The energy transition, aiming to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, is at the forefront of this increased demand. Copper is essential for constructing the infrastructure needed for renewable energy generation and distribution. For example, an offshore wind turbine can contain up to 8 tonnes of copper per megawatt of generation capacity, and EVs use over twice as much copper as traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. This shift towards green energy and electric mobility is expected to significantly boost copper demand, highlighting the metal's importance in achieving net-zero emissions goals.

In this context, ATEX Resources Inc. stands out as a promising option for investors and industry stakeholders looking to capitalize on the growing demand for copper. The company's Valeriano project, located in Chile's rich mining landscape, has demonstrated significant potential with its extensive copper-gold porphyry resource. ATEX's strategic exploration and development efforts have resulted in a significant inferred resource, highlighting high-grade porphyry trends and successful metallurgical recoveries. Moreover, with the backing of strategic shareholders and a robust financial structure, ATEX is well-positioned to advance the Valeriano project and respond to the global demand for copper.

The company's commitment to expanding its exploration efforts and the potential for further discoveries within the project area make ATEX a noteworthy player in the mining sector. As the world continues to move towards a more sustainable and electrified future, the strategic importance of copper will only increase, making companies like ATEX Resources, with their promising projects and strategic positioning, an attractive choice for those looking to invest in the future of energy and mining.

1afqp44_V,V,Alaska Energy Metals (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF) Nikolai Project Overview: A Sulphide Nickel and Battery Metal Initiative,"In Interior Alaska, a company called Alaska Energy Metals ($AEMC) is working on an exciting project called Nikolai. This project focuses on extracting sulphide nickel and other metals used in green energy products like electric-vehicle batteries. The goal is to secure a dependable domestic supply of nickel for the current shift towards cleaner energy 

**Project Overview:**  

Nikolai is located 80 km south of the town of Delta Junction, on the southern side of the Alaska Range. Historical drilling has found promising signs of a substantial nickel deposit, along with other valuable metals. In the fall of 2023, the first round of drilling was completed successfully by AEMC. With this new drilling AEMC will add to the amount of nickel documented in the ground, building on the maiden Inferred Resource published late in 2023. Look for the update in the first quarter of 2024. The potential for an Inferred Resource containing roughly three billion pounds of nickel is evident. 

&#x200B;

Every now and then you come across a stock that is high reward but relatively low risk. These are penny stocks that have the potential to 5x but the downside of going lower from current price is highly unlikely. These are stocks that lacking visibility.

Look up  **CEMATRIX Corporation (CTXXF)/** **CEMATRIX Corporation (CVX.V)**  (. Its a cellular cement company.

It's currently at 23c/share and only a 32 mil market cap.

I dent like promoting stocks for others or giving financial advice but I want the numbers and data to speak for themselves. Just look up their recent earnings and their backlog of existing contracts and future outlook and tell me how this stock does not at least tipple in 2024.

How often do you have a penny stock be an industry's leader in it's sector (Cellular cement might not seem like a big market but it's a niche business that is expected to be 48.2 Billion by 2031 while the market cap of this company is only 30 mil curranty). The US infrastructure bill only helps this industry and their partnership with Lafarge (the largest cement manufacturer in the world only gives it more credibility).

their current backlog of contracts is $92.3 million as of November 15th, 2023. and their market cap is $30 mil lol. This stock is going up for sure when people get wind of things.

I'm going to come back in a year and repost this thread when it's tipple the price. Feel free to screenshot this yourself and hold me accountable but i'm pretty sure this time next year this stock is over $1 per share.

101hvcu_V,V,VSIGX v IBTK (regular bond fund v defined maturity bond fund),I was wondering which bond fund I should choose. Originally I was going to go with VSIGX which is an intermediate-term treasury bond ETF. But then I noticed BlackRock has IBTK. It seems to trade like a ETF but mature like a bond. My reasoning was that bond funds like VSIGX need to maintain a certain average maturity date and so they have to sell some of the bonds potentially at a loss to balance the maturity dates. It seems like a defined-maturity bond fund could avoid this problem. But I don’t know much about them. Does anyone know what the pros and cons for both of these are? Thank you.,2023-01-02,75,7
zw92t6_V,V,How To Trade The W - V Pattern - ISRG Setup,"Hello Traders,

This is an educational post for identifying and trading a W - V pattern using the ISRG chart. This setup is done using the daily chart, however this pattern can be used with other time frames as well.

First off, when I'm am looking for trade setups I plan them out beforehand as I have done here. This is not yet a fully formed W-V pattern, however I have the trade setup planned so that if price does complete the pattern I am prepared and ready to enter.

The W - V pattern forms a... well, W-V. As you can see the W has formed, now I just wait to see if the V forms. If price retraces to the neckline at $244, the V will be complete and I will likely enter the trade.

Price target is technical resistance at $309, however I will likely exit half at the first resistance level at $275 then use a trailing stop for the second half.

Note: Although you would typically enter at the neckline for a W-V pattern ($244), it's very possible that price could trade down to $236 first to complete the gap fill and hit the 200MA first before reversing and trading back to the upside. - The reason I'm saying this is because you could potentially get a better trade entry if this occurs, so whether you enter at the neckline at $244 or the gap fill level at $236, is up to you.

I was wondering how the E/V ratio works with no debt and lots of cash. Because it has no debt, I would assume the E/V ratio is just 100%. But according to the internet, the definition of Enterprise Value (V) is Market Cap + Market Value of Debt - Cash. 

Imagine market cap is 20,000 million, debt is 0 and cash is 5,000 million. V is then 20,000 + 0 - 5,000 = 15,000 million. Then E/V is 133%, which does not make sense to me because 100% is already all-equity financed. What am I doing wrong? Do I have to subtract the cash from the market cap? Then it would be 100%.

Thanks",2022-10-02,4,7

vds62x_V,V,LME.V - Laurion Mineral Exploration - Due Diligence & Buyout Target,"TLDR: Gold mining stock poised to provide 800-1200% ROI over the next 3 months.

Laurion Mineral Exploration (LME.V on the TSXV) is a junior brownstone polymetallic mining company focusing on proving up resources on its flagship Ishkoday Project with the end-goal of a full-cash buyout in the near term.  Assay results have shown a strong presence of Gold, Silver, Zinc and Copper mineralization throughout the property.  As a result of the mineralization being near the surface, LME was able to first channel sample the property to create a 2D GIS model, and over the last couple years has executed a very successful drill program to turn that 2D model into 3D.  Managements goal over the past few years has been to prove up resources amounting to 10 million Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEO's).  Although an NI43-101 has yet to be filled, I believe they've managed to hit that 10M GEO target and as a result of the expansion of the original mineralized area (called the McLeod Zone) the number of GEO's being considered for a buyout could instead be in the neighbourhood of 12-15M.

The company doesn't hold any debt and has been able to fund its drilling programs through successful private placements over the last number of years that have all been oversubscribed.  As it stands, assay results for 12 more drill holes are expected.  To meet regulatory requirements, LME needs to hold an AGM by September, which leads me to believe that big news could be coming in the next 3-6 weeks.  It was announced this week that the CEO has exercised options for 1,530,000 shares, many of which weren't expiring until the end of 2022, 2023, and 2024.  If that's not a bullish signal for you that something big is about to happen, then I don't know what is.  She's also never sold off any of her shares of LME, so I wouldn't be scared that she exercised her options, only to sell them at a good profit.  In fact, she's LME's largest shareholder, which is why I have the confidence she's got her shareholders best interests in mind seeing as she has so much personal capital invested and so much to gain herself.

With the stock mostly trading in a **$0.90 to $1.15** range for the past few months, where do we see it going from here?  Earlier in 2022, another Canadian Junior Miner (GBR) was bought out by Kinross Gold for what I believe was **$200/oz**.  Most of GBR's mineralization was at depth's of \~1800m, which makes it very difficult to access.  If GBR was able to fetch that price per GEO, then what can LME reasonably expect to see on an offer sheet when an open-pit mine is feasible as a result of the mineralization being at the surface!?! Conservatively, if for some reason, the market downturn, and managements requirement for an all-cash deal results in LME receiving a similar price per oz as GBR then at 10M GEO's, they'd be looking at a **$2 billion cash offer**.  With a little over **250 million shares** outstanding, this results in a buyout price of **$8.00/share,** which is an **800%** increase from current market prices.  If we ere on the side of optimism with something closer to **$300/oz.** and/or **12-15M** GEO's, then a buyout price of **$10.00-14.00/share** isn't unreasonable to expect.

From their latest PR, it's mentioned 81% of shares are held by ""friends and family"" insiders.  This means there's at most 48 million shares up for grabs by the street.  I doubt anyone within that insider category are willing to part with any of their shares if they have an inkling of an idea what the company's end goal is.  With the prospects of a 10X investment being ripe for the pickings to anyone with an investment account, I find it hard to believe the share price isn't currently above the $2.00-4.00 mark.  Clearly this company isn't being spoken about enough, and it's truly in the category of a hidden gem.  With inflation hitting such high levels, gold is going to be the safest place for investors and I think LME provides tremendous upside potential.

Let me know if you have any experience with other junior gold miners and potential buyout targets as well as what was a price you've seen get paid per GEO.

v3awic_AXP,AXP,Visa/MA Valuation Compared to AMEX,"To start this off, I do know Visa dominates the card space by having over 50% of market share with Mastercard controlling around 22% and American Express controlling 18% roughly. 

Visa and Mastercard both trade around a 33 PE and above a 15 Price to Sales. This is brutal to me and seems all the dominance is priced in or just trading at an overvaluation. AXP trades at a 16 PE and around a 2 Price to Sales.

AMEX is right there with MA as far as the market share and they issue their own cards unlike MA. I know they are dominant in their space and create a crazy amount of money but the valuation seems brutal.

Any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will also no longer work within the country, the company said in a statement Saturday.

“We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” said Al Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer. 

“We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.”

I've done my DD, and invested with a company called TrackX (TKK.V) currently worth .045 - .05c CND (market cap of 6.25mill currently). $TKX is a SaaS-based enterprise that provides tracing, tracking and collaboration solutions. Their roster of clients include PII, PAG, TSN, PEP, GE, CVNA, GEICO, alongside several others.

There's obviously a risk, but the risk vs reward potential is what's very attractive about TKX especially at this valuation, and the new global environment for supply chain management requirements. The current valuation reflects their past/existing business and has high potential for a significant rerate based on recent developments and upon further future execution of their new higher margin SAAS revenue model.

They were also named top innovative technology provider in 2021.

qqsok5_V,V,Alphamin Resources ($AFM.V): Tin supercycle?,"There are a lot of indicators that point to a supercycle in tin.

* Tin is being used in small quantities and a lot of products (electronics, car, batteries,...).  Because it's only used in those small quantities, the demand is very inelastic, which means an increase in price will not cause demand to decrease a lot.
* Tin is coming out of a 10-year bear market and investments in new mines have been rare.  Not a lot of new deposits are expected to hit the market the next years.
* The price of tin is reaching new heights, while stocks on LME and SHFE are [decreasing the last few months.](https://twitter.com/Peter52834033/status/1456782002045128706/photo/1)
* China, the world's biggest producer and user of tin is short on tin and tries to consolidate tin deposits all over the world.
* Demand exceeds supply and it is predicted this will last.

&#x200B;

There are only a few plays out there but I will highlight the one that I think has the most value: [Alphamin Resources](https://alphaminresources.com/).

**What I like:**

Alphamin operates a high grade mine in the DRC.  Mining has started in 2019 and they are now mining 4% of the world's tin.  They are mining at the moment only at the Mpama North mine, but drilling has been done at a second sector: Mpama South, which indicates this has similar characteristics.  Drilling will continue and they regularly post updates.

They are net debt free since Q3/2021.

They are [are now conducting ""strategic review""](https://alphaminresources.com/2021/11/09/alphamin-announces-record-q3-2021-ebitda-of-us537m-and-a-net-debt-free-position-initiation-of-strategic-review/) to maximize shareholder value.  There has been a little bit of chatter on mining twitter what that would be and this has been most suggested:

* Payment of a (high) dividend
* There will be a buyout offer from another mining company (possibly Chinese)

Both the tin market and mines have been under the radar.  Unlike uranium for example.

**What I like less:**

The main risk that I see here is that the mine is located in the DRC, not the most stable jurisdiction.  However, management has been making it happening the last decade.

pj9fs8_PATH,PATH,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD: V, UPS, PRPL, PATH","This week we saw some CRAZY action in a few names that began to trend around social media. Let’s look at the following charts: SKLZ, VIH, and BBIG. Eventually traders FOMO’d into the trade chasing 25-100% gains… but it’s important to note that these high-reward plays are also VERY risky.

Remember, nobody really knows where a stock will go. As an investor or swing-trader it’s your duty to manage risk and use entry points that are suitable for protecting your hard-earned dollars.

&#x200B;

If you are swing-trading, as many of us enjoy doing, there are a few rules I live by when entering a position:

* If it’s based on sentiment avoid the red zones (FOMO zones) that I usually highlight on the charts. I try entering on a green or orange zone for the best risk/reward if it’s on a name I’d like to take a chance with.
* If it’s based on technicals, WAIT for the opportunity. There are hundreds of high-quality stocks, you don’t need to jump into a trade because it’s hot right now. Be patient with your entries and I guarantee you will become a better trader.

&#x200B;

For those of you that don’t remember or haven’t read some of my earlier posts.

**Red Zone** = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play.

**Orange Zone** = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone.

**Green Zone** = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade.

Here are the charts.

&#x200B;

**SKLZ**

https://preview.redd.it/5mwndl4sdyl71.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3e8afccf6e95119636dc1abcd1303ce7a5eb80b

SKLZ took off early in the week. The red zones are clearly defined on days the stock went up 10-25%. This is a chart with a very short-term timeframe, so the orange level is still somewhat risky. If SKLZ drops back into the green zone, it might be a better entry level. Note: I had this stock on my list a few weeks ago at $13.50, currently sitting at $12. This goes to show not all my watch-list stocks are winners.

&#x200B;

**VIH**

https://preview.redd.it/ejnd150tdyl71.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=5edf3eca81603b2de7b2116cbc00a0d9775f2c02

This SPAC started trending Thursday and Friday after the share price increased 15%. I’m going to stay away from this name since, generally speaking, the general SPAC trade that was popular earlier this year has been extremely under-performing since April.

&#x200B;

**BBIG**

https://preview.redd.it/qgrzwdqtdyl71.png?width=2428&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ba57ad183b52e059bc25c8ed3e9ee29d6ef2585

BBIG is a name that has trended BIGLY on Reddit and Twitter, pun intended. The stock squeezed to $5 in June and then fell to nearly $2 a share just two weeks ago. This is a great example of how one bad FOMO trade can completely wreck your portfolio. Those who were chasing this name in June at $4 after the stock doubled saw their positions cut in half by July.

A few weeks ago and back in the $2-3 range the risk/reward was becoming more favorable, but after recent price action it’s in my no-fly zone. Personally, if this gets back to $5-6 it might look interesting, but not right now.

&#x200B;

# What’s the difference between trading on technicals or sentiment?

&#x200B;

Whether you are trading on technicals or hype, they are very similar. They BOTH require lots of patience and waiting for the correct entry. Here are some points describing them:

&#x200B;

*Sentiment/Hype*

* Avoid FOMO/red zones
* Patiently wait for hype around the stock to calm down to pre-squeeze levels
* Are known to have explosive squeezes that can yield a 40-50% or more return in a matter of days
* Sentiment stocks are known to catch new waves frequently (think AMC in February and then again recently in May/June)

&#x200B;

*Technicals*

* Identify uptrends, support/resistance, break-outs, and consolidation
* Wait for the stock to get to your entry point
* Swing-trading on technicals can yield 10-30% per play

&#x200B;

The goal is to help identify plays that have become favorable for a swing-trade. This requires lots of patience, but can be very rewarding if you stick to the process. When you have at least a 6-month time-frame/outlook when getting into a position you greatly increase your chances of turning it into a winner.

&#x200B;

Don’t aim for 100% gains in one week.

Aim for 20-30% return in 6 months.

&#x200B;

This, of course, works for long-term buy and holds as well as medium-term swing trades. My portfolio is divided into the following two segments:

1. Long-term holds (6-months to 2 year outlook)
2. Swing-trades (come out profitable in 6 months, if it happens earlier that’s great, but not expected)

I want to make it clear that I absolutely never day-trade.

&#x200B;

Soon I am going to move my swing-trade segment of my portfolio to a different broker so I can highlight trades and make them easier to display.

&#x200B;

# The BTFD List

**Visa (V)**

https://preview.redd.it/wrm5zdmreyl71.png?width=2450&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbfa7fa4bdd99687faf55f13773374aeed99b801

Visa is at short-term lows. The upward channel/trend just broke down and it is currently sitting at support of \~$225. I might enter here looking for a bounce back to $240-250 level. My short-term risk is potentially seeing this at $210, a 6% loss, while I think the upside could be 10-20%. Visa is also a relatively safe blue chip stock that pays a dividend and RSI is hitting some solid over-sold ratings.

&#x200B;

**UPS**

https://preview.redd.it/xlansygseyl71.png?width=2446&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d4b402fb782a0bd2a4d322bbe6ed0daa6fd659

UPS’ share price took a hit after earnings just a month ago. It consolidated for a full month and has recently crossed back over the 50 EMA (orange line), while sitting right at the 100 EMA (dotted blue line). We might see that earnings gap get filled and a bounce back to $210 level.

With the holiday season coming up it would be wise to keep an eye on economical data such as retail sales, consumer spending, and e-commerce earnings reports.

I like UPS at this price.

&#x200B;

# The MEME List

**Purple Mattress (PRPL)**

https://preview.redd.it/4zr76kxweyl71.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6be953feb732e0883ba7887d95313660db4513e

Purple Mattress has been in a slow decline since May. I think we’ll find some support here at the $23 range. It will face some resistance at $30 level, but if it gets enough momentum to go past we could see this back in the $35 range. PRPL has been known to pick up on social hype and it could be an interesting entry point for a swing trade here.

&#x200B;

**UI Path (PATH)**

https://preview.redd.it/7t1qlx43fyl71.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3814e27156ef2a1b20815fbb57914ad81b52d6d

NOTE: Earnings Tuesday September 7th after the close. UI Path IPO’d in April and is down 25% from the highs. PATH is a growth stock so this is more on the risky side. I am LONG shares of PATH from about $61, currently $63. ARKK ETF currently holds this stock at roughly 2% weight of the ETF.

Here’s a look at some option flow from Friday, courtesy of the Vig platform.

https://preview.redd.it/mejyovd3fyl71.png?width=1870&format=png&auto=webp&s=26f2e0689c983181c2483e1940f2f6a2f5984a11

In August of 2011 during the debt ceiling crisis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the federal budget would show a deficit of close to $1.5 trillion, or 9.8 percent of GDP. 

8/1/2021 we are entering a new debt ceiling crisis with congress on a 6 week vacation, combined with an expired rent moratorium where 6.2 million renters face evictions, the homeowners of said tenant's houses will likely never receive back-pay for rent owed possibly causing record high bankruptcies akin to 2008 or worse, and without taking this into account, CBO projects a federal budget deficit of $3.0 trillion this year as the economic disruption caused by the 2020–2021 coronavirus pandemic, while the legislation enacted in response continue to boost the deficit (which was large by historical standards even before the pandemic).

At 13.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP), the deficit in 2021 would be the second largest since 1945, exceeded only by the 14.9 % shortfall recorded in 2020.

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2019, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.3 %.

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 14.1 %.

Which in my opinion and as shown below by these reports is due to the insanely high level of newly printed money and covid stimulus payments.

https://www.cbo.gov/publication/21999

CBO estimates from 2011 would be heaven in comparison to the reality we're facing, which is a crippled economy, and stock market on the verge of collapse. Evident as follows;

In 2011 CBO projected the 3 month Treasury bill to be worth 4.4% in 2021.

The actual 3 month Treasury bill rate for July 2021 is worth between 0.01 and 0.06%.

In 2011 the projected 10 year Treasury note bill rate was projected to be 5.4% for 2021

The actual 10 year Treasury note bill rate is 1.24% In July 2021

Part 2 of 4

7/29/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Beureau of Economic Analysis, on the Gross Domestic Product, Second Quarter 2021

A report by the Beureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, shows that the 2nd quarter of 2021 has been a bloodbath in terms of loss of income, savings, and increased expenses for the average American.

Personal Income: ""Current-dollar personal income decreased $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, or 22.0 percent, in contrast to an increase of $2.33 trillion (revised), or 56.8 percent, in the first quarter of 2021."" -

This means that income literally was cut by nearly 22% on average in 2nd quarter of 2021.

Disposable personal income decreased $1.42 trillion, or 26.1 percent, in the second quarter, in contrast to an increase of $2.27 trillion, or 63.7 percent (revised), in the first quarter. - Again all fake gains thru the stimmy.

Real disposable personal income decreased 30.6 percent in Q2, in contrast to an increase of 57.6 percent in Q1. - and again Trump & Biden Bucks.

This means that (money considered as non-essential, 🙄) decreased by over $890 billion for Americans in Q2 of 2021 alone.

AT THE SAME TIME, Personal outlays (expenses) increased $680.8 billion in Q2, after increasing $538.8 billion for Q1. - This means that expenses have increased by $150+ Billion in average from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021 for Americans! Can you say inflation?

Personal savings was $1.97 trillion in the second quarter, compared with $4.07 trillion (revised) in the first quarter of 2021

The personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was DOWN 10.9 percent in the second quarter, which was already DOWN 20.8 percent in the first quarter.

This means Americans have lost $3 TRILLION in savings Q2 2021 ALONE.

Where does it go? Banks and lenders?

Inflation seems to be the only thing that's going up this quarter.

""The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent (revised) in the first quarter...   The PCE price index increased 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the 1st quarter.

5/1/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, on GDP and the Economy for Q1 2021

The acceleration in real GDP growth reflects artificial economic strength.

The GDP is primarily based in the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as government assistance payments were distributed to households and businesses. An acceleration in consumer spending and upturns in federal as well as state and local government spending more than accounted for the acceleration in real GDP.

These were partly offset by downturns in private inventory investment and exports and by decelerations in residential fixed investment and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports slowed.

The US Economy by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis says;

""The acceleration in consumer spending reflected an upturn in spending on goods and an acceleration in spending on services.

Within goods, all components of both durable and nondurable goods contributed to the upturn. The leading contributors were upturns in spending on motor vehicles and parts as well as on food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption.

Within services, the leading contributors to the acceleration were upturns in spending on food services and accommodations and on transportation services.

An upturn in federal government spending was the second largest contributor to the acceleration in real GDP. The upturn primarily reflected an upturn in nondefense spending on intermediate goods and services purchased by government. In the first quarter, the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government added approximately $13.2 billion ($52.6 billion at an annual rate) to nondefense services. Federal government purchases of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to the public contributed to the upturn in nondefense goods.

The upturn in state and local government spending reflected an upturn in consumption expenditures, led by compensation of employees, that was partly offset by a downturn in gross investment, led by a downturn in structures.

The downturn in private inventory investment was led by a larger decrease in retail trade and a downturn in manufacturing. Within retail trade, the largest contributor was a larger decrease in inventory investment by motor vehicle dealers. Within manufacturing, there were downturns in both durable and nondurable goods manufacturing inventory investment.

The downturn in exports reflected downturns in both goods (led by a deceleration in industrial supplies and a downturn in foods, feeds, and beverages) and services (led by a deceleration in transport and a downturn in royalties and license fees).

Residential fixed investment slowed, largely reflecting a slowdown in new residential structures, notably single-family units, and a downturn in brokers' commissions.

Nonresidential fixed investment slowed, reflecting a slowdown in investment in equipment that was partly offset by a smaller decrease in investment in structures. Investment in intellectual property products grew at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter.

The slowdown in equipment investment was more than accounted for by a slowdown in transportation equipment that was partly offset by an acceleration in information processing equipment.

The smaller decrease in structures was more than accounted for by a smaller decrease in investment in industrial structures.

Imports slowed. As a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, imports contributed to the acceleration in first-quarter GDP. The main contributor was a downturn in automotive vehicles, engines, and parts""

https://apps.bea.gov/scb/2021/05-may/0521-gdp-economy.htm

July 21, 2021 CBO released report:

""Additional Information About the Updated Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031""

""As the pandemic eases and demand for consumer services surges, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in CBO’s projections grows by 7.4 percent this year and surpasses its potential (maximum sustainable) level by the end of the year.""

A.K.A a market crash is insinuated by CBO and they directly state that the GDP of this nation surpassing maximum sustainability!

https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57263

Meanwhile, CBO claims unemployment will decrease....

""Employment grows quickly in the second half of 2021 in CBO’s projections and surpasses its prepandemic level in mid-2022. Inflation rises in 2021 to its highest rate since 2008 as increases in the supply of goods and services lag behind increases in the demand for them. By 2022, supply adjusts more quickly, and inflation falls but remains above its prepandemic rate through 2025. As the economy continues to expand over the forecast period, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes rises, reaching 2.7 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2031—still low by historical standards.""

But unemployment hasn't decreased at all.

7/21/2021 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released report states, ""The national unemployment rate, 5.9 percent, was little changed over the month""

Part 3 of 4

The Debt Ceiling Dillema

""A two-year deal to suspend the debt ceiling lapsed at midnight (7/31/21) following inaction from Congress and President Biden to give the U.S. more borrowing authority. The Treasury Department will now begin taking what it refers to as ""extraordinary measures"" to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt.""

""Republican leaders have told Democrats that there can be no bipartisan debt ceiling agreement without a slate of debt reduction measures targeting the roughly $28 trillion national debt. Several GOP lawmakers have floated a deal similar to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which ended a debt ceiling standoff shortly before the U.S. suffered its first ever credit downgrade.""

CBO says, ""the Treasury would probably run out of cash sometime in the first quarter of the next fiscal year (which begins on October 1, 2021, most likely in October or November, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.

The timing and size of revenue collections and outlays over the coming months could differ noticeably from CBO's projections. Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, either earlier or later than CBO projects.

Yellen has also said uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's fiscal response has made it harder to pin down exactly how long the U.S. to avoid a default.""

Yellen stated that the default could happen as soon as early September.

This means we could see the US Treasury's ability to pay almost all bills completely crippled well before or after Congress' return to duty as they just began a 6 week vacation on 7/31/21.

https://thehill.com/policy/finance/565745-missed-debt-ceiling-deadline-kicks-off-high-stakes-fight

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-29/the-federal-debt-limit-political-drama%3f_amp=true

Our GDP is a complete farce that was being held up by stimulus payments, government covid spending, Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements of Treasury Bills to the tune of now over $1 Trillion per day, imports and exports are down huge while sea ports are more severely congested than ever before as are airline cargo carriers. Mortgage applications, sales, and broker commissions are down heavily, trucking rates are at all time highs with minimal availability especially for ocean and rail drayage, warehouse storage for said freight is at maximum capacity with available space at all time lows & prices at all time highs due to supply and demand, retail trade and manufacturing are down significantly as well in Q2. Consumer spending is down as well as savings to lows not seen in many years as well.

Essentially the bubble from stimulus has already been popped. It's only a short matter of time before we see the effects on our country and it will be reflected on the stock market first and foremost as it is already being seen by the banks unwillingness to invest in long term stocks/bonds/treasuries using the record high $1 Trillion per day Repurchase / Reverse Program to prevent the dollar and market from collapsing together.

A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office analyzing the 2013 debt ceiling standoff found that ""investors reported taking the unprecedented action of systematically avoiding certain Treasury securities,"" which are considered almost as safe as cash, causing widespread issues across credit markets.

""Industry groups emphasized that even a temporary delay in payment could undermine confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States and therefore cause significant damage to markets for Treasury securities and other assets,"" the report said.

The last 2 times the debt ceiling crisis occurred in 2011 and 2013, rating agencies to re-evaluate the rating of US government debt.

On October 15 2013, Fitch Ratings placed the United States under a ""Rating watch negative"" in response to the crisis.

On October 17 2013, Dagong Global Credit Rating downgraded the United States from A to A−, and maintained a negative outlook on the country's credit.

In 2013 while lawmakers and the Obama Administration came to an agreement on the debt ceiling, from September 19th to October 9th, the S&P 500 moved below its 50 day moving average and the SPY lost 5.2%.

On 8/9/2011 during the Debt Ceiling Crisis The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 634.76 points as approximately $2.5 TRILLION was erased from global equities.

That's $2,500,000,000,000.00 in one day.

The S&P 500 Index lost 6.7 percent to 1,119.46, its lowest level since September, as all 500 stocks fell for the first time since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1996.

7/30/21 -Federal Reserve announced commercial bank asset and LIABILITY numbers release H8

The Liabilities have grown big time since last year.

Federal Reserve released COMMERCIAL BANK ASSET & LIABILITIES numbers for July 2021 and year over year losses have increased tremendously in the tens of trillions of dollars, a large majority of this is based on derivatives, options calls/puts, mortgage back securities, swaps of all kinds, rehypothecated shares, naked shorts, synthetic shares up the ass... See screenshot for explanation of subsection 22 losses description.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/

All of the 11 Tables provided shows an increase of losses.

The only table pictured is TABLE 2 showing an increase of $1.54 Trillion in unrealized losses in the form of derivatives, securities, swaps, etc...

On Table 2 (of 11) alone, their RESIDUAL Assets (less liabilities) <minus expenses> increased only $40 Billion compared to the $1.54 Trillion increase in losses.

So even though they had huge increases in revenue (covid stimulus), the net gain was hugely diminished by the losses in these sectors.

6/28/2021

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released report stated that 4 large banks held 89 percent of the total banking industry notional amount of derivatives, a total of 1,385 insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations held derivatives at the end of first quarter 2021.

Additionally,

derivative contracts remained concentrated in interest rate products, which represented 72.7 percent of total derivative notional amounts.

the percentage of centrally cleared derivatives transactions increased quarter-over-quarter to 38.2 percent in first quarter 2021.

In 2011, gridlocked House Republicans and the Obama White House came within days of a drop-dead default over the debt ceiling. The S&P 500 fell for five days in a row leading up to the weekend that lawmakers finally struck a deal. Over 4% of the entire stock market was lost in those 5 days.

osmgzl_V,V,Petroteq multiple catalysts $PQEFF/$PQE.V/$PCQF.F,"Hello hello,

OK, two catalysts.

TL;DR  - FEED study came back positive, and Mysterious Bidder contacted the  company directly. Shares likely to go brrr. Price is reasonable now,  will not be later.

Y'all may recall the interest around PQEFF when an offer was placed in the [German Business Gazette](https://bundesanzeiger.de/) indicating an offer to buy roughly 47% of the company at €0.48 a share - $0.57. This was posted in this forum by  [u/kirkrikster](https://www.reddit.com/user/kirkrikster/) [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nkcfrm/pqeff_recent_newsfiling_suggests_a_10x_increase/).  There was understandable skepticism, because that was almost exactly 10  times the price that PQEFF was trading at at the time and the broker,  Uppgard Konsult AB, are primarily a forestry company.

Well, now things have changed, and two major catalysts have landed

**1. Front End Engineering Design (FEED) Study**

Petroteq  have been operating a demonstration plant in Utah for the last few  years, and using it to iron the kinks out of the process, in partnership  with Valkor Engineering out of Texas. That study was completed recently  (after the offer in Germany) and sent for 3rd party verification. That  verification has now been received by the principal, TomCo Energy, who  have [announced the results](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/TOM/receipt-of-final-feed-study-and-third-party-report/15073972).  The two details that stick out are indicative costs of $22 per bbl in a  5000 bpd plant operating 24/7/365, and the comments by the TomCo Energy  CEO

>*The  FEED study  outlines better economics for the proposed plant than we  initially  envisaged, together with verification that the proposed  technical  approach is appropriate*

Nice.  TomCo through their Greenfield partnership with Valkor are already  raising the estimated 110 million financing to build the plant.

*Edit: Rumour is that the FEED study itself will drop tomorrow. Petroteq are expected to make an announcement this week.*

**2. The Uppgard offer went live**

So  the Uppgard offer was weird on the face of it. Uppgard said they were  working on behalf of an unnamed client and the offer was only to  shareholders with more than 1million shares in Europe. It fizzled,  predictiably, after spiking the share price to $0.22 or so. However, it  didn't go away. Uppgard extended the deadline, increased the offer to  €0.5 ($0.59) per share, and engaged a [Canadian law firm](https://www.accesswire.com/655815/Uppgard-Konsult-AB-Update-on-its-Share-Purchase-Initiative-for-Petroteq-Energy-Inc-TSX-VPQE-OTCPQEFF-FSEPQCF?s=09) to begin preparing an offer for North American shareholders. As part of that process, they have made public a proof of funds showing that they can afford the share purchases.

The [real catalyst came today](http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-accesswire/2076185/petroteq-announces-contact-from-uppgard),  though, as Petroteq announced that its Securities Counsel has been  contacted by Uppgard's clients. Before a recent share offering round the  company were attempting to acquire 200 million shares which was roughly  47% of the company. After the funding round (including a quarter  million share purchase by the CEO) that will have fallen to  approximately 36-41% depending on the exercise of issued warrants.  Apparently this prompted the Mystery Bidder to contact the company  directly.

**Risks**

Petroteq recently raised \~$5MM with a fairly large dilution, although this has not really hit the share price badly.

They also had to announce [a late filing of the 10-Q](https://www.accesswire.com/655922/Petroteq-Announces-Expected-Late-Filing-of-Financial-Statements-and-Application-for-Management-Cease-Trade-Order-Cautions-Against-Reliance-on-Certain-Previously-Issued-Financial-Statements)  because of an issue around disclosure of a potential liability, and  will have to refile their last 2 years 10-K (annual reports).

The  Petroteq demonstration plant is just that, a demonstration plant. It  has been run at up to 180 bpd, and the oil sold at WTI prices, which is a  premium. While some financing is in place, the output of the plant is  not currently defraying much in the way of costs. The plan is to push  the output higher, but this has not yet occurred.

TomCo  need to raise 110m for their plant, and the appetite for this will be  dependent on oil prices remaining above $50/bbl, in my opinion.  Petroteq's revenue model is dependent on royalty payments (a hefty 5% of  the gross oil revenue) so will be limited until these plants start  producing.

Talks have been opened,  but that does not mean that talks will conclude with anything. This is a  penny stock, invest at your own risk, and beware the jabberwock!

ol4ymo_V,V,JNJ V.S GOF (Safe V.S High yield),"I want to start this off with 2 quotes that have stuck with me from the youtubers: Dividend Bull and Passive Income Investing (Adrian).

[""Going onto other youtuber's ""portfolio review"" videos, the biggest complaint about dividend growth investing is how big the portfolio needs to be just so you can live off dividends. People normally living off dividends have around a 1 million dollar portfolio... For many people saving this kind of money isn't possible in their life time and can be extremely discouraging.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn6PnM_OVCA&t=12s)\- Dividend Bull

While these quotes aren't anything special they do make great points or point you in the direction this post and videos are going.

Comparing:

I want to start this out with comparing a high yield income focused stock (GOF) against a favorite for dividend growth investors (JNJ). I want to show people just how quickly an income focused stock can compound compared to an expensive blue-chip company, and why it's so appealing to some people (There is some assuming as we can't determine JNJ's dividend increases or future stock growth).

Let's compare JNJ against my favorite US income fund GOF (via Google Finance):

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-

**Dividends:**

JNJ:  
Yield: 2.5% ($4.24)

Quarterly dividend: 1.06[Increased 5% 2021, 6.3% 2020, 5.6% 2019](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-dividend-increase-of-5-0)Increases yearly around $0.04 - $0.06

GOF:  
Yield: 10.11% ($2.19)

Monthly dividend: 0.1820[increases by 0.0001 and decrease 0.0001 but has never fallen below 0.1820](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOF/dividend/)Let's assume it stays at $0.1820 for the below example).

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Onto the simple Test (some math / Hypotheticals)

**You have $10,000 USD to invest in ether JNJ or GOF. Let's see what your results are if you held it for 5 years (You could continue this trend but the same results would still show):**

$10,000 / $170.10 (after hours as of writing this at 4:13PM) = **58.78 shares**

$10,000 / $21.65 (after hours as of writing this at 4:00PM) = **461.89 shares**

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The increases from JNJ average around [$0.05](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/jnj/dividend-history) , with a few $0.06, and a few $0.04. To make this easier to calculate lets pick the ""safer bet"" and say they increase their dividend by $0.05 on a yearly basis.

Tickers: JNJ GOF

Shares **58.78 461.89**

2021 dividends (4.24) $249.22 $1,011.53

**2022 Shares 60.24 508.61**

2022 dividends (4.29) $258.42 **(+$9.2)** $1,113.85 **(+$102.32)**

**2023 Shares 61.75 560.05**

2023 Dividends (4.34 )$267.99 **(+$9.57)** $1,226.50 **(+$112.65)**

**2024 Shares 63.32 616.7**

2024 Dividends (4.39) $277.97 **(+$9.98)** $1,350.57 **(+$124.07)**

**2025 Shares 64.95 679.08**

2025 Dividends (4.44) $288.37 **(+$10.4)** 1,487.18 **(+$136.61)**

**2026 Shares 66.64 747.77**

2026 Dividends (4.49) $299.21 **(+$10.84) $**1,637.61 **(+$150.43)**

**Total Returns: $1,641.18 $7,827.24 (4.7 Times more)**

In this ""5 year chart"" we can see what would happen if you added $0 extra and only re-invested the dividends, assuming JNJ continues to increase its dividends by $0.05, and the stock appreciations stay the same with 0.00% growth.

Even with a $0.05 increase JNJ is almost 5 TIMES slower then GOF's compounding. There is a few major factors to this mainly being that JNJ has:

* a much smaller yield small yield (2.5%)
* Its significantly more expensive then GOF

These small factors obviously won't change overnight or even in years, so GOF will always beat out JNJ with these numbers (Even if JNJ had insane increases it would still seriously struggle to beat GOF) in both the short term and LT (if we exclude dividends). If growth does get added (which we have to use past data cause we don't know the future) JNJ would probably beat GOF. But then your also planning to sell JNJ for... what? more then likely more JNJ when it falls back down or for an income fund cause your ready to start focusing on large monthly return.

This is why Income investing is becoming more and more appealing for people to invest in high yield/income stocks. The increase in large blue-chip dividends (even with 5 years/1,825 days) is significantly smaller then GOF's dividend return. You have to rely on ""It's value will continue to increase"", or your stuck with an insanely small yield.

Major Advantages to this strategy:

**Stock Appreciation doesn't matter**

* A F.I.R.E / Income investor is investing in these type of stocks to purposely build up monthly income, if the stock price falls great! You can buy more at a nice discount, the stock price literally doesn't effect you.  
EX:  
If GOF falls to $0.01 it will continue to pay its 0.182 dividend. Just because the price falls doesn't mean the yield will as well or they will cut the dividend. That is a few ""risky"" stocks like Split Corps.

**ETFs/CEFs fall less in volatile markets**

* If a market crash was to happen, ETFs and CEFs normally fall less then single stocks. QYLD, NUSI will fall less then MSFT or APPL will. this is due to the ETFs holding more then just those 2 companies. On top of that ETFs and CEFs normally pay a much higher dividend then single companies will.

**Dividend compounding**

* As shown above high yield income focused stocks can give a faster compounding then large companies. While some investors in large companies (APPL, MSFT, JNJ, MMM) are there for the growth and slowly increasing dividends the growth isn't always guaranteed and can slow down or speed up. You don't know for sure.

**Stock appreciation CAN still happen for income stocks**

* Income stocks can see some minor growth, while MSFT will run 9% or more NUSI, JEPI, QYLD might only run 0.9% or less. But overtime this will slowly climb as well. This is more of an extremely minor ""extra"" as you normally aren't in this strategy for stock appreciation

# RISKS: 

# Yield Traps (Seriously watch out for these)

This video explains it a lot better than I could ever try:[The Dividend Yield Trap explained with 5 Examples - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRv10mQee4s)

While this can be extremely easy to avoid new investors normally jump into stocks that are yield traps due to ""oh look an insane yield!"" and nose dive into it without research or they do minor research. For the love of god do your own DD PLZ! your saving yourself a ton of trouble.

**You loss out on Stock Appreciation:**

* Although you can get some minor growth from income stocks you won't get as much as an ETF (with low yield) in the S&P 500, or single companies like MSFT, or APPL. This is the major thing you are sacrificing for this strategy (if its worth it is ultimately up to you).

**""Expiration dates"":**

* Not really a risk but a ""just so you know"" type of thing. This is more common in Canadian stocks but some stocks and split corps have ""expiration dates"".EX: EIT.UN (EIT-UN.TO) has an expiration date of June 2050 for example. This means the CEF will be ""unlisted""/removed in June 2050, unless the company that owns the CEF wants to expand its ""expiration date"" (which is normally the case). In Canada your broker will sell the ETF/CEF for you automatically and deposit the cash back into your ""available funds"" to ether withdraw or re-invest.

**EDIT:**

( [u/DontForgetTheDivy](https://www.reddit.com/u/DontForgetTheDivy/) asked for GOF's holdings so here ya go!)  
GOF Holdings:

GOF, in my opinion, is an insanely weird CEF. It has **683 Holdings** with

* Securitized (Basically all bonds) - 15.73%
* Cash and Equivalents - 3.71%

ojodhd_V,V,"Equities Rebalncing, quarterly v monthly?","Hi,

I have a simple equities momentum strategy that screens global stocks for certain fundamental and technical characteristics, uses a stop loss and rebalances. If a stop loss is used, yearly rebalncing has the poorest returns, makes sense as the money just lies around until next year earning 0 return. The more frequent the rebalancing, the better the return, which also makes sense as the edge is played out a number of times. However, I am only able to go down to quarterly and don't have the means to see if monthly rebalancing would improve returns albeit from yearly to 6 monthly to quarterly improves returns linearly so conceptually more frequent rebalancing is better. Of course, keeping in mind that costs will also add up with more frequent rebalancing so perhaps quarterly is best..

The system buys a portfolio of 10 stocks each quarter and uses a stop loss of 5 to 10 pc. I expect the spread plus commissions for each buy or sell would add upto approx 0.5 to 0.75 pc or so of the purchased, sold amount as its mainly small caps.

Any thoughts on whether I should even consider monthly rebalancing even thought I cant test it or is quarterly likely the limit? I expect it is not unrealistic to expect 20 to 30pc a year from the system, not compounded, just gross of expenses.

# Explaining the $0 Earnings and Dividends/Yield:

**NWX gets its cash from Royalties and its 100% interest from its investments**, specifically, from two companies. NWX can't make decisions in the Cooper Basin but does make royalty from the company on a Quarterly basis (This cash is then used to pay shareholders their dividends).**Specifically:**

* 100% interest in the Chu Chua copper-gold project located to the north of Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada.
* 2.5% gross overriding royalty interest on oil and gas permits in the Cooper Basin in Queensland, Australia.

Quote:

>As stated in a Company News Release dated March 12, 2021, the Company retains the option of **increasing the quarterly dividend at any time**, as it did in December 2020 with the tripling of the scheduled quarterly dividend amount. **The Company's strong balance sheet ensures that it has the ability to not only maintain regular $0.01 per share quarterly dividend payments, but to increase the second quarterly dividend for 2021 to $0.02 per share**. This is being done for the benefit of all shareholders and without taking on any debt or undertaking equity financing.  
>  
>**Notwithstanding the doubling of the second quarter 2021 dividend, the Company still retains a margin of financial safety to maintain scheduled dividend distributions.**  
>  
>*""The recent decrease in production should be offset this quarter as a result of the 39% increase in oil price received by Beach, and by doubling the second quarterly dividend, Management is simply keeping its pledge to return GOR revenues to shareholders in a timely manner,""*stated Ian Rozier, President and CEO of Newport.

# Why I'm considering this company:

I'm mainly considering going into this company for the yield, as an income investor (And someone in higher yield then this (18% is my highest)) I'm interested. It seems to be sustainable, they have $0 debt, they have investments in oil producers that pay them a nice large sum of cash. They just seem like a pretty steady company to invest in. Although I don't see the yield rising much more the yield at its current price is insane to me.

EDIT: Guys I get it, this is still newer technology and a new publicly traded company.  Tread carefully, this is still fairly speculative and IF you enter a position consider starting small.  This is an investment in BATTERY technology and only graphene by association but this will still take time.  RISK MANAGEMENT FOLKS. I am not a financial advisor.

&#x200B;

Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) is an Australian based company that specializes in the production and sale of graphene enhanced products. Traditionally cost prohibitive and difficult to produce high quality Graphene, GMG’s proprietary production method using Natural Gas (Methane) instead of Graphite allows for high quality, inexpensive graphene to be produced.  This allows GMG to pivot towards fast-charging Aluminum-Ion battery prototyping/production as their primary products.

&#x200B;

ALUMINUM-ION BATTERIES AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

Aluminum-Ion Batteries are a newer type of battery currently being researched and tested by a number of organizations, including University of Queensland (UQ) and Stanford University, and have shown increasing promise as an alternative to Lithium-ion batteries. The additional benefit of using little-to-no heavy metals (i.e. Lithium, Cobalt, etc.) makes this a super attractive formulation.

One of the limiting factors has been the graphite/graphene (depending on prototype tested) used in the battery. While I’m not going to deep dive into the ins and outs of graphene production, traditional methods producing graphene from Graphite are expensive and difficult to obtain a high-quality plane structure. This is where GMG comes in……

The University of Queensland, in their Aussie government funded research into Aluminum-Ion batteries, went with GMG to supply their graphene and found they were able to achieve fantastic results. GMG’s high quality graphene plane structure produced from natural gas instead of graphite allowed for a breakthrough in the amount of aluminum atoms that could be “inserted” inside of the graphene planes (layers) to produce high density electrodes………

&#x200B;

THE RESULT OF THIS?

A high-density battery that acts practically like a super capacitor. **Charges times up to 60x-70x faster and capacity comparable to traditional lithium-ion batteries WITHOUT EXHIBITING HEAT ISSUES THAT WOULD CAUSE A LITHIUM-ION BATTERY TO EXPLODE TRYING TO CHARGE THIS FAST**. Numbers like these might sound too good to be true, but this is peer reviewed research by the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at the University of Queensland. And Graphene Manufacturing Group has exclusive access to this battery formulation through their research and commercialization agreement with the University of Queensland and Uniquest (UQ's commercialization company) because they supplied the Graphene free of charge.

&#x200B;

ENERGY DENSITY

Below is a chart of the current Aluminum-Ion technologies being tested.

[\*Lithium Ion: Energy Density \~100-265 Wh\/kg, Power Density \~250 – 340 W\/kg  \(Source: See links at end of page\)\*](https://preview.redd.it/sbsaun2ddh171.jpg?width=911&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23d77989abc17d4d72c87ea88c697acfd37078e1)

>”GMG Managing Director Craig Nicol insisted that while his company’s cells were not the only graphene aluminum-ion cells under development, they were easily the strongest, most reliable and fastest charging.  
>  
>“It charges so fast it’s basically a super capacitor,” Nicol claimed. “It charges a coin cell in less than 10 seconds.”

&#x200B;

MULTIPLE OBVIOUS USES FOR BATTERIES LIKE THIS

* Cars – Fully charge a car in 10-20 minutes
* Cell phones – Fully charge a cell phone in 1-5 minutes
* Laptops
* Coin Cells (watch batteries) – Fully charge in 10 seconds
* Powerwalls
* etc

&#x200B;

PROS

* Much faster charge times
* Little to no Heat buildup
   * Safer charging and at faster rates
   * Weight reduction in batteries (less cooling and thermal management circuitry)
* Reduce dependence on China for rare earth heavy metals
* Materials are highly recyclable and easy to obtain
* Cycle lifespan up to 3x longer than traditional Li-ion
* Can fit into same housings and operate at the same voltages as Li-Ion

&#x200B;

>“So far there are no temperature problems. Twenty percent of a lithium-ion battery pack (in a vehicle) is to do with cooling them. There is a very high chance that we won’t need that cooling or heating at all,” Nicol claimed. “They don’t need circuits for cooling or heating, which currently accounts for about 80kg in a 100kWh pack.”

&#x200B;

CONS AND OTHER NOTABLES

I will always be the first one to talk about potential caveats and downsides:

* Graphene is traditionally expensive - GMG’s method claims that it is much cheaper to produce than traditional methods, but final figures are still yet to be known.  Current prices from other producers are around $100/gram, but this figure is for typical graphene production methods using mined graphite. GMG has plans to ramp up production so pricing models are yet to be known. I was unable to find how much graphene is required per kg of battery, likely proprietary info right now.
* Infrastructure – If charge times truly are this fast, our electric grid simply cannot handle large batteries charging this quickly.
   * However there are proposed workarounds for this. For example, I have seen suggestions of charging an Aluminum-ion powerwall to full capacity at a slower rate and then using said powerwall to fast-charge an EV separate from the grid.
* This is still in early prototyping right now but the research and production methods are sound. GMG is a smaller company and it will take time to ramp up graphene production and develop new products.

&#x200B;

GMG’S PLAN MOVING FORWARD

Graphene Manufacturing Group currently has research and commercialization agreements with the University of Queensland and Uniquest and has begun the prototyping stage:

>“Under the agreement, GMG will manufacture commercial battery prototypes for watches, phones, laptops, electric vehicles and grid storage with technology developed at the University of Queensland (“UQ”). GMG has also signed a license agreement with Uniquest, the University of Queensland's commercialization company, which provides GMG exclusive license of the technology for battery cathodes.”

Currently, their revenue is pretty small from their traditional graphene products they sell, but they have made it clear that they are pivoting to batteries this year. GMG is starting with coin cell batteries by the end of 2021 and are aiming to work their way up to automotive style batteries estimated around 2024. Currently they hope to run with the technology and vertically integrate it themselves instead of licensing the technology. However, they have stated this is not set in stone and potential partnerships with phone / automotive companies could be an option.

GMG recently went public and trades as $GMG.V / $GMGMF

n3by8r_V,V,Investing Philosophy V (Fundamental vs Technical Analysis: which works better? Why does the stock price drop after an earnings beat?) - 5/2/2021," 

Hello investors,

It's been a while since I last posted a memo and I am still going through a busy transition with the work. I hope everyone is staying safe and riding the markets to the top.

**1) Fundamental vs Technical Analysis**

I wanted to discuss a topic that should probably have been addressed earlier. I didn't realize until recently that many of the folks that are just getting started in trading tend to lean more towards the ""technical"" analysis of investing and I believe it is critical to understand what the difference is between a technical and fundamental analysis.

**Quick answer to the question of which works better, there is no better or worse. It's a combination of the two that makes an analysis more comprehensive, based on a** **Mosaic Theory****.**

Just for the sake of formality, here are the quick definitions of each.

**Technical analysis:** Technical analysis is concerned with price action, which gives clues as to the stock’s supply and demand dynamics – which is what ultimately determines the stock price. Patterns often repeat themselves because investors often behave in the same way in the same situation. Technical analysis is concerned with price and volume data alone.

**Fundamental analysis**: Fundamental analysis considers the value of the company. This ultimately depends on the value of its assets and the profits it can generate. Fundamental analysts are concerned with the difference between a stock’s value, and the price at which it is trading.

Many people tend to look at the charts and patterns of stock price movements and make quick decisions based purely on the technicals, such as breaking out of a resistance level, forming a consolidation, gapping, ascending vs descending triangles, moving averages, and so on.

I think what many fail to understand is that these trading strategies are highly specialized, meaning that there are hundreds of thousands of people trying to benefit from this type of analysis and most of them fail to achieve consistent returns.

And these are industry veterans with years of experience and the resources with computing power to recognize patterns and being able to execute on the trade ideas in a millionth of a second.

It's not to say that you can't profit consistently from these strategies. I'm saying you cannot simply rely on ""this stock price just broke the 200-D moving average and has a potential to move exponentially higher"" type of analysis.

There is a concept called **""efficient market hypothesis"" (""EMH"")**, which basically states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible.

Now, I have previously mentioned that it is possible to generate alpha in this memo.

What I didn't mention is different levels of EMH.

**Weak efficiency: This type of EMH claims that all past prices of a stock are reflected in today's stock price. Therefore, technical analysis cannot be used to predict and beat the market.**

**Semi-strong efficiency: This form of EMH implies all public (but not non-public) information is calculated into a stock's current share price. Neither fundamental nor technical analysis can be used to achieve superior gains.**

**The point of today's memo is that I believe the market tends to fluctuate between weak and semi-strong efficiency levels of EMH, meaning a combination of fundamental and technical analysis can lead to excess returns and I personally tend to put a heavier weight into the fundamental analysis.**

From a personal standpoint, technical analysis is almost a 50/50 chance game for an average trader. A person who monitors charts at home during the day out of his/her 4 monitors will almost never generate consistent profits over 10-20 year period.

Don't get me wrong. It is possible to generate alpha for that person.

All I'm saying is of the 1,000 hours he spent monitoring and trading on those securities, only 10 hours of research actually resulted in any profitable ideas and he just racked up tens of thousands of dollars in trading fees, **just to increase his winning odds from 51% of all trades to 52%.**

It's not really an efficient way to use your time and energy if you ask me.

After all, technical trading yields very thin odds of success, anywhere from 51% to 53% winning probability on any single trade. That's why professional investors diversify their strategies across hundreds of different trades in a single hour using automated trades, which an average investor doesn't have the capacity to do so.

My suggestion is to approach it from the Warren Buffett style of investing.

Study the company, understand the business model, and evaluate how the company is priced relative to your view of the intrinsic value.

**One important caution to this approach.**

I have also observed recently that many people tend to buy into this type of analysis: **""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and people will likely to eat out at bars and restaurants and therefore, I will buy the restaurant stocks.""**

Or this, **""Biden administration is pushing clean energy policy and EV stocks will outperform.""**

While these are good ideas to start off of, they're not the end.

It's almost like saying ""US population is increasing and more people will drive cars. Therefore, I will buy auto stocks.""

These are big leaps in assumptions. We need to fill in the gaps.

My suggestion is to think in more depth, especially in terms of numbers.

For example, ""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and restaurant visits are increasing as % of 2019 levels. Darden Restaurants is poised to benefit from this trend because it is highly specialized in an indoor dining experience and the demand is picking up, as evidenced by its growing sales numbers that are higher than its competitors. The stock is currently trading at 37x 2021 P/E, which seems to be undervalued given the fact that it is expected to grow its bottom line at more than 40% over the next three years, yielding a PEG ratio of less than 1. Its peers are also trading at 50x 2021 P/E. Therefore, if the company exceeds the profit growth expectations, the stock has a potential to outperform the market.""

This is a more in-depth fundamental analysis, divided into two parts: 1) qualitative factors that prove why the company is better positioned against its competitors and 2) quantitative factors (mainly the valuation, or what the market priced in) that will drive its stock price outperformance.

**The bottom line is, when you are picking stocks, do not make the big leap in assumptions, coupled with preliminary technical analysis. Instead, approach it from a view of an investor: ""what is good about this business and why would I buy into this company rather than its competitor who seems to be having more success? Is the company priced at an appropriate valuation? Will its market cap grow from $10B to $50B? And why?""**

Which leads me to the second topic of today's memo.

**2) Why does the stock price drop after an earnings beat?**

The answer is simple: it's because the market has priced in a better outlook than what's reported.

If the street consensus estimate was $2 EPS for a company and the earnings came out to $3, it doesn't mean the stock price will jump. And it can be for many different reasons.

Perhaps the company beat on the earnings but fell below the estimates on the topline.

Or the company's margins shrank dramatically.

Or the company sold lower volumes of a new line of cars than expected, which was supposed to show an exponential growth. But the higher-priced cars offset the losses and still resulted in an earnings beat. The market was pricing in the growth of the new line of cars but now that growth expectation has disappeared.

You really need to think at a high level on earnings beat. It's not a 1+1=2 type of problem.

**On top of that, you will never know what the market has priced in its growth expectations until the actual earnings come out.**

This is because we can only know what the market has priced in only after observing the stock price reaction after the earnings. Because the stock price dropped after the earnings, the market was expecting a better outcome than the actual and by definition, it is an after-the-fact analysis.

Over time, the stock price mean reverts to its earnings potential and any anomalies in the way will be reverted back.

Thus, a better game to play is to focus on its fundamentals, study the earnings, and determine if this company will outperform not just qualitatively but also from a quantitative perspective. Will it expand its trading multiple? Will the earnings outperform the street expectations?

Hope this helps and thank you for reading!

mxcs6r_V,V,"Canadian Dividend Investor mini DDs and some small tips/mistakes I made: ENS (E-Split) V.S. ENB (Enbridge), ZWC, and a ""weird"" CEF: PDI","***!!!Obviously not financial advice!!!!***

Note: If your Canadian and looking into US dividend stocks there is a 15% non-withholding tax, unless your also a US citizen, this CAN be avoided in an RRSP (But I know little to nothing about RRSPs so I'll leave it there).

Hello everyone I've been investing for a little over 2 months now, and I wanted to try and help any new Canadian investor. with some small tips that I didn't learn till recently or a month into my investing journey.

**TLDR: If you have a personal account BAIL ON IT NOW and open a TFSA to avoid taxes on gains/dividends!!**

# Things I wish I knew when I started:

* Once you choose a broker IMMEDIATELY open a TFSA (Tax-Free-Savings-Account) and only put your money for LT investing into this account.
   * This will avoid ALL/Most taxes on your investments (as long as you do 1 VERY important thing)

1. **Stay within your contribution limit! (I found out about this after investing around 3K. I'm happy I did!):**

* You do have a "" [Contribution Limit](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html) "", based on when you turned 18 (The link will send you to the CRA's official website and go into more details on Contribution limits)!   
EX: I'm 23 and so my contribution limit is 23K (just how it added up). So I won't get taxed as long as I remain at or below the 23K, Once we get into next year this amount will increase.
* In a TFSA **Dividends don't count towards your contribution limit** and are borderline ignored by the government.  
EX: If I invest exactly 23K into only dividend stocks (literally my plan), Once I get my dividend payments I can either:   
1. Re-invest it into stocks (remember I can't put money into my TFSA if I hit my limit, but dividends CAN get put back into stocks ;) (I think you can see how truly broken this is)   
2. Withdraw it for cash

# ONTO the Stocks!

# E-Split vs Enbridge (Debate):

There is an ongoing debate from Canadians of the E-Split Fund (Ticker: ENS) which is heavily and ONLY invested in Enbridge but offers a higher dividend. Or if you should just invest in Enbridge.

This honestly boils down to the person investing. From my research, I've seen they follow a semi-close trend as they somewhat copy each other. I prefer monthly dividends over quarterly but I also like each about the same as they both have their own strength and downfalls (ENB has few but still).

There are a few arguments for each:

**ENS Arguments:** 

* ENS is a CEF (Closed-Ended-Fund) which means it has an Expense Ratio! (funny enough it's hard to actually find out what it is. Apparently, its 0.75% which really isn't a lot compared to other CEFs)  
* ""If your planning to buy 1 share of ENB you may as well buy 3 ENS as it's almost 4x's CHEAPER"" ENS ($13) Vs ENB ($46)
* ENS has a higher yield of 11.80% and pays monthly while ENB pays 7% Quarterly
* ENS has yet to cuts its dividend so it's likely a ""stable"" CEF, but is also slightly volatile in its stock price, normal for a CEF off what I've found (CLM, PDI)
* ENS uses covered calls to make money (Lost money 2020, and 2018)
* ENS mimics ENB's stock price (just at a lower cost) even stating: ""The objective of the ordinary ENS shares is to provide investors with a regular monthly dividend and capital gains linked to the share price performance of Enbridge. ""

**ENB Argument:**

* In ENS you don't actually own a share of Enbridge, you're simply buying into a fund ONLY in Enbridge. But if you buy a share in ENB you OWN that 1 share in the company.
* ENS has lost money lately and has to normally sell ENB shares in order to keep paying its dividend, ENB doesn't have this issue, and will likely increase its dividend LOTS over the course of years.
* ENB has increased its dividends quite a few times throughout the years, so you will miss out on these and only get your .13 CAD Monthly (which will likely never change or increase)
* ENB is less volatile, stock price-wise, compared to ENS

Good reading material: [E-Split Corporation: A Poor Alternative For Enbridge | Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305386-e-split-corporation-poor-alternative-for-enbridge)

# Opinion:

Honestly, ENB is the better way to go for the long term and it's also less risky. It has grown its dividends, and its stock NOT having an expense ratio makes it overall a better option as you don't lose money. However, I can see why people like ENS, its 100% into Enbridge, semi mimics its stock price, is cheaper, offers a nice monthly dividend, and seems decent for a CEF.

I own both (25 shares - ENS, 4 shares - ENB) and agree with both arguments however I think ENB stands out more as it's safer, and has a great chance of growth while ENS will likely stay the same and continue to lose money due to its high dividends (Which I'm assuming will eventually mean they have to cut it)

# ZWC

**The BMO CA High Dividend Covered Call ETF** [(ZWC.TO)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZWC.TO?p=ZWC.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch) is a Canadian ETF that's operated by BMO (Bank of Montreal), this ETF is mainly the Canadian Banks and life insurance companies (TD Bank, Manulife for examples). This is a VERY popular Canadian ETF and is part of the BMO ETF family (You have likely heard one of the many stocks in this family if you looked into Canadian ETFs).

**So what makes this so appealing?**

* its high **Yield: 7.62%** paid out monthly (.11 CAD)
* Its stock price has VERY little movement (**it's basically a ""Floater Stock"" at this point**). this means VERY little gains but it also means it has little risk. Although it is still trying to reach the $18 mark (Very slowly mind you)
* Reasonable Expense Ratio of 0.65%
* Gives good exposure to the Canadian banks and life insurance companies:
   * What it holds: TD Bank, Royal Canadian Bank, BMO, Enbridge, Manulife, BCE, Canadian National Railway, Great-Western Lifeco Inc, etc.
   * 41% Financial, 15.3% Energy, 10% communication services, 9% Utilities, 7.9% Industrials, 6.5% Basic Materials, 5.6% Consumer Defensive, 4.2% Consumer Cyclical
* Ran by a decent-sized Canadian bank, meaning it has great financial support when/if it needs it

# Opinion:

God, I love this fund, I've been in it for a little over a month and it was my first Dividend stock I jumped on (25 shares @ 17.46). This fund gives me great exposure to expensive stocks for a cheap amount (Specifically talking about the Banks), pays a nice safe yield of 7%, has little risk, has great backing if funds ever become an issue, and pays monthly as a nice bonus! Although it does have an expense ratio of 0.65% it's the only con I can find in this fund. Overall 10/10 ETF in my opinion.

# PDI

 **PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund** [(PDI)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/PDI?p=PDI&.tsrc=fin-srch)  is a CEF (Close-ended-fund) These normally have 3 things...   
1. insanely high dividends, 2. LOTS of dividend cuts and 3. A high expense ratio... this has 2 out of the 3

**PDI is weird for a few reasons:**

* PDI has actually **INCREASED** its dividends and kept it the same since. Only cutting and then re-adding, for some reason, $0.0005 monthly.
* Has a **very high yield** of 9.27%
* Has a **VERY** **high expense ratio**: 3.71% (This is due to two companies managing the fund)
* Pimco actually gained cash in previous years but lost a large amount in 2020 (So aside from 2020 its been feasible for them to pay out their high monthly dividend)
* Has small growth (It had slow growth till March 2020 when the market crashed. It's still trying to recover but should be almost there)

 [PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund (PDI) Dividend History | Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDI/dividends/history) 

# Opinion:

I've been eyeing this CEF for a while and finally bit the bullet and got 15 shares @ 28.55 today I likely won't add much to it as it's very volatile and too risky to justify a large position in ANY portfolio. I'm keeping it at only 10% - 15% MAX. PDI, although having a great dividend record for a CEF, is still too risky share price-wise to justify a large position in portfolios. For now, this is more of a ""just so you know"" type of thing.

Portfolio for anyone interested (outdated but I'll add ENB soon):

# -Advanced Beginner-

## Spreads

* Spreads (with 2 legs) are neat because they manipulate how delta and theta act.  It caps your gains and losses, but you can profit with less stock movement.  Try several spreads on a P/L calculator to see for yourself.
* Spreads usually require margin trading.
* Spreads allow you to define max losses (assuming you close before expiration day) and use less capital.
   * Experienced traders will open many spreads at identical/similar strikes to heavily profit off movement.  Spreads can make you/lose you a lot of money if you are right.
   * For example: I could make $200 premium off a $500 risk trade, max loss would be $300.  This is much more effective capital utilization than a naked or cash secured put, however it does not have the same downside protection or “wheel” potential as a written/sold put.  Higher risk, higher reward.
* Vertical Debit spreads:  I think of these like mini calls/puts.  I personally don’t use them unless calls are outrageously expensive or the break even is absurdly high, but there’s nothing wrong with them.  A call debit spread will lower your breakeven and overall cost vs just a call.  You can do clever things like making a positive theta call spread if you’re creative.  I like doing this since I hate losing money to theta.
* Vertical Credit spreads: 
   * Very good theta strategy to define downside/upside risks.
   * A put credit spread is bullish and allows you to bet on upward movement with less capital and defined losses.
   * A call credit spread is a bearish strategy that allows you to bet on downward movement.  These are very cool since they allow you to sell calls without selling naked calls, which can ruin you financially.  I see selling these as better than buying puts since it’s so much easier to be profitable; to be redundant, Θ rocks.

* **I repeat this on purpose: Don't EVER leave short spreads open on expiration day, close them.  If you don't close, they better be VERY far from the strike on a non-volatile stock.  In after hours a stock can jump/dip below your strike and be exercised without the other leg to protect you.  This can lead to massive, life ruining losses.  This is not an exaggeration, google this and be scared.  It happened to a fair number of people with TSLA.**

## Trading Mechanics, Taxes, Market Manipulation

* Learn about wash sale rules.  They suck and are very easy to activate with options.  This will eliminate your ability to write off losses.  Over trading can easily cause wash sales.  
[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp)
* Order Fills:
   * A good broker will fill your orders quicker, potentially with better prices.
   * I tried using RobinHood for cheap spreads and iron condors to save money.  It ultimately ended up costing me money.
   * I recently watched RH fail to close an Iron Condor for $10 over the market price for an hour.  I eventually had to pay even higher over market rate to close it, which cost way more than trading fees.
   * I have placed identical vertical spread orders on E-trade & RH; E-trade filled almost immediately, sometimes cheaper than my limit price.  RH sometimes did not fill at all.  I have had to “chase” spreads in RH by adjusting my price, losing me even more money.
   * Free brokers often provide the illusion of saving money.  If you save a $.50-.65 commission, but get a fill that is $1-2 worse, you actually lost money by using a free broker.
* Short attacks:
   * Learn to recognize these sketchy attacks by hedges/firms.  They manipulate the market, it’s been documented countless times.  A common one is rapid short selling, which pushes the price down.
   * Short Ladder attacks:
      * [https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)
      * Some people say short ladder attacks don't exist.  I've seen some very strange stock nosedives off low volume, so I tend to think they do.
   * If you plan well enough and the market doesn’t give up on the stock you may be able to use it as a great opportunity to buy the dip.
* Cramer explains how he intentionally manipulated the market when he ran a hedge fund years ago.  Multiple links to the video are below since this video gets pulled often, Cramer / The street never wanted this to go public.
   * Reuters article: [https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320](https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320)

   * [https://youtu.be/QFfjX8dW-QQ](https://youtu.be/QFfjX8dW-QQ)
   * Due to this video I don’t fully trust Cramer.  His show can give you stock ideas to buy (or inverse), but you never know where his true loyalties lie.
* Plan for taxes if you are up big.  You may need to over withhold or contribute to taxes quarterly depending on your situation.  [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306)

## Technical Indicators / Technical Analysis (WIP)

* Technical indicators can be very useful to plan trades or attempt to predict stock movements.  Resistance and supports can be fairly reliable.
* Very common indicators are 50, 100, & 200 day moving averages, volume, RSI, and MACD.  I use these most of the time.
* Volume Profile
* Bollinger Bands:
* Moving Average Envelope
* Rainbow Moving Average Indicator

# -Intermediate / Advanced Strategies (work in progress)-

*You’ll notice many of these strategies inverse one another.*

## Short Strangle / Straddle

* Both of these strategies profit from little price movement.  I recommend using a P/L calculator to determine BE, profit, etc.
* A straddle sells (or buys) two options at the same expiry and strike.
* A strangle sells (or buys) two options at same expiry with different strikes.
* Both these strategies involved selling a Call and a Put for a credit.  Straddle uses ATM legs, strangle uses OTM legs.
* Limited max profits and unlimited risk.  Due to the unlimited risk, I am not a fan.  However, many people like these a lot.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx)
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-straddle.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-straddle.aspx)

## Iron Condor and Iron Butterflies

* These strategies profit from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  They receive a credit to open and benefit from theta decay.  If your stock is range bound, these may be a good choice.
* These are both 4 ""legged"" trades, so you will have 4 trading fees to enter or exit the trade.  A lower cost broker shines here.  However, “bad” free brokers (like RH) will give you poor fills, which is not worth the discount  (see fills above).
* Condors and butterflies have ""wings"" which are your purchased puts and calls.  The wider the wing the higher the max profit/risk.  The condor body can be riskier and skinny with a narrow high profit range or wider for a much greater chance of success with lower payout.
* An iron condor is built by combining a put credit spread and a call credit spread with the same expiry.
* An iron condor can be thought of as a modified short strangle with limited risk, and therefore a bit less profit.  I prefer defined limited risk.
* The butterfly is similar except instead of a plateau it has a sharp peak.  My personal mental note is that a condor looks more like a strangle with wings, while a butterfly looks like a straddle with wings.
* Pay attention to earnings dates when you open these, I have forgotten to check before and it led to bad trades.

## Long Condor (Debit Call Condor)

* The debit version of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to stay inside your defined range.  This strategy profits from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  I’ve never tried this, Iron Condors make more sense to me.
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/condor.aspx)

## Short Condor (Credit Call Condor)

* Inverse of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to go OUTSIDE your defined range.  These are useful when you expect significant price movement.  Credit to open.
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* Can be harder to set up.  I want to try these, haven’t yet.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-condor.aspx)

## Reverse Iron Condor

* Inverse of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to go OUTSIDE your defined range.  These are useful when you expect significant price movement.  Debit to open.
* I haven’t gotten to try these yet, looking for a good opportunity right now
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/reverse-iron-condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/reverse-iron-condor.aspx)

## LEAPS

* Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities
* LEAPS Options are options that are long term with many DTE, often over a year until expiration.  LEAPS calls are great for long term growth plays (downtrends with LEAP puts) or simply when you really like a company and can't afford 100 shares.  LEAPS (or any ""longer term"" option) enables you to sell a PMCC or PMCP (below)
* They are technically over 1 year.  Sometimes people informally refer to options with over 6 months DTE as LEAPS.
* LEAPS are always technically used for both 1 or multiple LEAPS since it’s an acronym.  I sometimes informally call a single contract a LEAP so I don’t sound like a tool.

## Diagonal Spreads: PMCC / PMCP

* PMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call (or poor man's covered puts).  They are diagonal options, often used with purchased LEAPS.  You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.  These are very powerful; I’m using them more and more often to replace “non-explosive” growth calls.
* For PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.  These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.  If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting ""blown by"" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.  Keeping your purchased LEAP deeper ITM should protect you.  Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.
* I'm currently tinkering with these myself.  So far I like .7-.9 delta call LEAPS with 30-45 DTE calls on my CC.  The goal is to hold the LEAP long term, potentially until expiration, and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.  Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAP anymore.
* Some people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my cost basis until it's zero (or even negative).  I have a page in my notebook I write each CC on my NIO LEAP (I Meme stock sometimes).  I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.  When I originally wrote this I had \~2 years left on it and it's 9-10% paid for; that doesn't even count the actual gains the LEAP has.
* TT states this is considered an IV play, which I partially agree with.  You want to buy these during low IV times since an IV drop will hurt your LEAP value.  I look at them more as a way to sell calls/puts on a high IV company with a lot of price movement and potential upside/downside.

## Advanced Orders

* Guide to several order types: [https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/order-types-from-basic-to-advanced-07162019](https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/order-types-from-basic-to-advanced-07162019)
* One Triggers Other (OTO):
   * Good brokers will allow you to set these up, some will require a desktop to do it.  This lets you link one action to another.  In programming think of it like an if-then.  You’ll tie a buy/sell to another buy/sell
   * Setting trailing stops on options is very chaotic since their price movement can be drastic due to volatility.  I prefer to set my trailing stop to a stock. 
   * What I like to do is set a trailing stop on a stock (or just link it to a stock price drop) and have it sell 1 share I own.  Then it immediately executes a market order to sell my call.  I’ve had good luck doing this with incredibly volatile plays where stop losses aren’t effective.  I’ll often have an order saved and ready saved for when a strong run up starts.  When my price alerts start blowing up my phone, I’ll immediately hit execute to turn it on.

lhx62a_V,V,$NOU.V / $NMGRF - Nouveau Monde Graphite - DD,"I haven't seen a post that does this stock justice, so here we go. My second DD for you guys.

&nbsp;

$NOU.V for Canadian investors. $NMGRF for US investors.

&nbsp;

Nouveau Monde will be a key operator in the sustainable energy revolution, developing the only fully integrated source of green battery anode material in the Western World. With full scale commercial operations by 2023, NMG will provide advanced carbon-neutral graphite-based material solutions to the growing lithium-ion and fuel cell markets, with low-cost operations, the highest of ESG standards, ensuring robust and reliable advanced material, while guaranteeing supply chain traceability.

&nbsp;

Do you like mining companies? I sure do. The company wants to operate a mine in province of Québec in Canada. Located only 150 km north of Montréal, the Company’s world-class deposit constitutes the largest projected graphite operation in North America and Europe and is expected to become the world’s first all-electric open-pit mine.

&nbsp;

The Quebec Government has issued an environmental decree, authorising the construction of Nouveau Monde’s Matawinie mining project. The decree covers a starting production level of 100,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of high-quality graphite material, which will form part of Nouveau Monde’s value-added anode strategy – supplying material for the electrical vehicles and renewable energy storage industries. The 100,000 is just a start with ramp up over the next few years. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/10/2172855/0/en/Key-Milestone-Reached-as-Nouveau-Monde-Receives-Quebec-Government-Authorisation-to-Build-What-is-Set-to-Become-the-Western-World-s-Largest-Graphite-Mine.html)

&nbsp;

Nouveau Monde’s development plan embraces sustainable development measures, including water management system, tailings co-disposal, progressive land reclamation and biodiversity protection, acclaimed by the government’s environmental experts. Also includes eco-engineering advancing to ensure optimal design of the site’s infrastructure and progressive reclamation with vegetation that bolsters biodiversity and captures carbon. This is very GREEN for mining.

&nbsp;

The communities around Matawinie welcome the project as a positive contributor for socio-economic development, including direct and indirect employment.

&nbsp;

Some fun napkin math:

* 53 kilos of graphite pack a car battery, on average.
* Average cost for graphite to pack a car battery with graphite (after processing) $3,000 to $5,000
* Plus ""The decree covers a production level of 100,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of high-quality graphite material, which will form part of Nouveau Monde’s value-added anode strategy – supplying material for the electrical vehicles and renewable energy storage industries""
* 100,000 tons at 53kg per battery = ~1,886,792 batteries at $3k to $5k = $5,660,377,358 to $9,433,962,264 in potential revenue, just from this initial contract. That's $5.7B to $9.5B in potential revenue with this initial.

&nbsp;

I like that napkin! What do you think? Rocket ship? Expect this to hit $3 within a couple of weeks, and to go higher from there in the coming months as they continue deploying.

&nbsp;

**PLUS** The company posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy7R6sc1xiI) today. Very interesting and in depth on the whole operation.

lgpn8y_V,V,NYSE v. Off-Exchange(FINRA) Short Volumes for GME: Short Volume in Public Exchanges Wasn't Even Half of Whats Needed for 150% Drop in Short Interest,"**The drop in SI from 226% to 78% required around \~100 Million shares to cover shorts, but the NYSE only saw 49 Million Short Volume, while OFF-EXCHANGES saw about 3X as much.**

Got the **Daily Short Exchange Trade data from NYSE now** so I can compare it to the FINRA numbers that I've been using in the past. General bullet points below:

# TLDR: Check bottom, look at Figure 1, and Napkin Math.

&#x200B;

* **Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded ""upstairs"" in OFF-EXCHANGES (OTC) but have to be reported... or should be...**
* **Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.**
* **Short sale trades done on NYSE  are NOT in the FINRA data, and vice versa.**
* **The GOOD STUFF is in the** [MONTHLY SHORT SALES FILES](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021) **and it isn't out yet for January.**

&#x200B;

To start out we can compare the total volumes for GME across the public exchange, NYSE, against the off-exchange, FINRA's numbers.

[Figure 0: I DONT HAVE ALL THE VOLUME, as YAHOO reports nearly double what NYSE and FINRA are reporting. Missing Volume was added to show Yahoo-\(NYSE+FINRA\)](https://preview.redd.it/7rohwucqflg61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf399f5180a2bc22c68320fad0eb8f542c1b3299)

* *DISCLAIMER: No idea where the Missing Volume is from, but it's not on the NYSE and not being reported to FINRA? Does Yahoo count volume some other way?*
* I sure as hell didn't know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges, but we got data now. Notice how it really doesn't pick up until the 13th though, and it seems to be settling down as we get further into February.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Comparing NYSE to OFF-EXCHANGE short volume with respect to GME's Float.](https://preview.redd.it/4qhtpaqqflg61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=67ca1196548a84f92c5c8d87b1c83b2f863cf812)

* Figure 1 lays out just exactly where the shorts are going on. Jan 13th nearly used the entirety of the GME Float in the off-exchange.

&#x200B;

[Figure 2: Short Volume\/Total Volume from FINRA and NYSE Daily Short Volume files, respectively.](https://preview.redd.it/n0zdmv7czlg61.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=df17986998464f35f8053bb0c3c3daa92285cdf2)

* Figure 2 shows us that around \~50% of all the volume, no matter which exchange, is around shorts, even before Jan 13th.
* Jan 19th - 26th, see how the NYSE actually leads in short volume/total volume on those days, WHICH were also the same days that GME shot up toward $400+

&#x200B;

Next I wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bi-monthly reports for GME and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the off-exchanges.

&#x200B;

|FINRA|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|84,529,878|155,033,361|79,236,275|
|Short Exempt Volume|1,119,003|**3,437,532**|**4,306,437**|
|Total Volume|193,791,490|415,527,741|146,617,603.00|
|Short Vol/Float|1.80|3.31|1.69|

# NOTE: SHORT EXEMPT VOLUME IS THE ONLY THING NYSE HAS MORE OF THAN OFF-EXCHANGES!

&#x200B;

|NYSE|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|13,279,699|49,046,558|19,041,023|
|Short Exempt Volume|587,776|**5,075,452**|**7,304,781**|
|Total Volume|31,822,868|105,950,709|43,875,824|
|Short Vol/Float|0.28|1.05|0.41|

Now let's use some of these numbers to check some reports.

# NAPKIN MATH TIME

1. So 226% SI for around Jan 15th  and we're at 78% SI reporting now, from end of January.
2. 226-78 = \~150
3. 150% Short Interest = 150 (Shorts/SharesOutstanding)
4. Shares Outstanding = \~70Million
5. 70Million \* 1.50 = **105 Million Shorts were settled from 15th to 29th**

OK, I can believe that 105M shorts went through because that's when GME went up to to $400+

The only thing is, and here's the kicker...

# Of the 100+Million shorts only 49 Million were executed on the                     NYSE during Jan15th to 29th!

We still have 55 Million shorts that were executed those two weeks, and in the FINRA exchanges we can see the155 Million short volume.

But how/where do they do this OFF-EXCHANGE trade you might ask?

# RIGHT ON YOUR DAMN PHONE, Urist McPaperHands!!!!!

*""For market makers with a customer order to sell, they will temporarily  sell short (which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination) and then immediately buy from their customer in a  non-media transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double  counting share volumes.""*\-  [OTCMarkets.com](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

* **If you sold GME via any of those apps, chances are they bought up those shares themselves AFTER they used them to cover their shorts.**
* **The rest of the shorts are just in the ether of OTC exchanges**

Granted I can't get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed, how many started to juggle around with options, but we do know that before tonight the SI was above 200% and has been updated to 78%.

I believe that the update is referring to data at the end of January. CORRECT ME IN COMMENTS!!!

**TLDR:**

1. **NYSE see's only 1/5 the volume that OFF-EXCHANGES do regarding short volumes for GME**
2. **""Short Exempts""are nearly twice as prevalent in the NYSE than OTC**
3. **Only half of the shorts were executed on the NYSE to decrease SI from 226% to 78%**

3) Speaking of Jeff Dahn, I know most people already know this, but Jeff Dahn's brother(Rodger Dahn) and his daughter(Jessica Dahn) works at Manganese Energy X Corp. Now whether this a direct link or a plant seeded, this is still in my books a golden speculative play that MAY in the future hold fruition to contracts with Tesla. Also other than the fact Rodger Dahn is well known as Jeff Dahn's brother, he's worked as a Exploration Manager at various mining company through his extensive 30 year career so this guy knows his stuff.

4) Manganese Energy X Corp is meeting this Q1 to talk about its arrangement agreement with their wholly owned subsidiary Graphano. Anyone holding MNXXF or MN.V before their meeting will receive 0.125 share of Graphano for every MNXXF or MN.V they hold. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/manganese-x-announces-arrangement-agreement-051500913.html

5) Biden Administration is around the corner. Every country practically on this planet is planning a move to EV infrastructure. Manganese is going to be the new hot commodity and you guys are chasing stocks when this is currently sitting comfortably at $0.30. I rest my case.",2021-01-18,141,67

kliktp_V,V,DD: Neo Lithium Corp : NLC.V:TSX,"Hello Everyone, 

This is my first post here, and I'm going to be explaining some DD on Neo Lithium Corp. You can read for yourself some of the information I have [here](https://www.neolithium.ca/index.php). **All of the $ values in this post will be in CAD - Canadian Dollars**

**Fundamentals:** 

NLC is a lithium/lithium carbonate mining company headquartered in Toronto, and operating in Argentina. They are traded on the TSX, under the ticker symbol **NLC.V.** They are planning to operate in the Lithium Triangle, a region in Argentina/Chile/Bolivia **LOADED** with Lithium. Approximately 27% of the worlds Lithium supply is mined out from this region, and 12% of which is located in Argentina, where Neo Lithium Corp is operating. The area in which they operate is 100% owned by Neo Lithium Corp, which lowers external risks from competitors operating in the area. More info on the competitors will be included below in the risks section.

Now, into the good stuff. Currently, NLC is priced at $1.56 / share (@close December 27th) with a market capitalization of \~$187M. Yes, I know, the market cap is quite small compared to other big industrial companies, however this company is fresh and is showing great upside potential. Recently, they secured an \~$8.6M deal with CATL, a massive Chinese lithium battery manufacturer, where 10.2M shares were sold to CATL. This is good news because it means that this company is getting noticed and people are buying in. NLC has a strong net cash position, approximately $35M, with little to no debt. The no-debt thing was mentioned in their investor presentation, but take it with a grain of salt. I believe they have little debt, but it would be foolish to assume that they are completely debt-free, however, they are in a great position cash-wise. Approximately 9% of outstanding shares are owned by company insiders, 40% belonging to institutional ownership, and the remaining 51% being publicly owned. The volume on average is \~290k which is quite low, but is steadily increasing as the days go by. I expect to see a massive volume increase by the spring.

Speaking of the spring, the last peace to this puzzle is **to obtain the construction permit.** Once this permit is granted, the company will be fully operational and start generating revenue. As this happens, news will come out and with that, attract investors to this company. There is no definitive date where this permit will be granted, however I expect it to happen before Q3 of 2021. When this permit is granted, and revenue starts being generated, I expect the stock to rise by AT LEAST $3 by Q4 2021. The best thing about this is that the price currently is dirt cheap. Yes, I know, stocks that are priced this low are quite volatile and risky, however, it is up to you and your personal risk tolerance to decide if this play is right for you. I've included a risk section to detail every risk that could be potentially threatening to this company. Continuing on, you will be able to absolutely load up with shares on this company and by the time summer of 2021 comes around, you should be able to realize a large gain. Please note that this play will take anywhere from a few months to a year to actually make you some money, however if they are successful in operations then holding longer will prove more profitable.

**MY POSITION (CURRENTLY) : 122 shares @ $1.50 / share.** I would like to say that while I would love to buy more shares, I'm a semi-broke college student with not a lot of money to invest, so I'm doing the best I can. I do plan on buying more shares with any money received over the holidays. Please refrain from making fun of my positions, lol. 

&#x200B;

**TA:** 

Right off the bat I'm going to admit I'm no saint at Technical Analysis. I have watched quite a bit of videos, and gained a minimal amount of knowledge in TA. However, the rule of thumb stands, which is **to conduct your own TA**. This is simply DD.  I'm going to include my share of TA so that you guys can get an idea of how the stock is performing, however it's definitely best if anyone interested conducts further TA.

[This](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=NLC.V) link is the link to the [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com) graph of NLC. It includes the RSI, MA (50/200), and the MACD chart. Starting with the RSI, this stock fluctuates in between 50 and 70, and ATM is at 61.15. This is a decent rating as it indicates the security is neither underbought/overbought. It fluctuates periodically over 70, only to drop immediately after. It typically drops a few cents when it peaks above 70, but typically recovers once it hits \~50.

Moving on to the candlestick chart w/ moving averages. As seen in many other securities, the 50 day Moving Average acts as a support line, and you can see for yourself how it bounces after it comes close/touches the support line. Both moving averages are showing bullish symbols, so that is always good. 

Looking at the MACD indicator, as I'm writing this the EMA's are bottoming out after a bearish 2 weeks. I expect to see a nice, bullish 1-2 weeks coming. The indicator shows lots of people selling, but the number of which dropping each week, which to me is bullish. The candlesticks are currently showing a bullish uptrend above the support line but looking at how the stock has performed in the last 6 months I think it will continue to bounce, which is inline with what the MACD indicator is showing. 

**TA TL;DR:** Technical Analysis of this security is showing a bullish trend in the coming weeks.

**Risks:** 

**Risk #1: Construction Permit Not Granted.**

The first main risk with this play is the construction permit getting blocked. This would be absolutely detrimental to the company as the future of NLC is entirely dependent on this permit being granted. There are 2 reasons that I believe would be the cause of the permit being denied

* **COVID-19**
   * Obviously, COVID-19 is a serious risk to tons of businesses this year. If COVID-19 continues it's rampage on the world we might see the local government in Argentina cancelling any concurrent operations. This could mean a delay in getting the construction permit, and if granted, a pause in the construction process. We also have to take into account that COVID-19 procedures in Toronto may cause delays in decision making/administrative related-decisions. Ultimately, most of the risk from COVID-19 is focused in Argentina.
* **Argentinian government changes their mind.**
   * I really do not see this happening, but I'm just including it juuuuust in case. Other companies already operate in this area and have been for quite a while, so the odds of this happening are quite slim. If it does happen, its not good news for NLC.

**Risk #2 - Competition**

This is a risk that occurs in any industry. Competition is inevitable, and some may see it as a bad thing but I see an increase in competition as a sign of money to be made. Most of the worlds lithium is produced by ""the big three"": **Albermarle Corp, FMC Corp, and SQM (**Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile)

* **Albermarle Corp** mines lithium in CHILE
* **FMC Corp** mines lithium in ARGENTINA, however the lithium division of the company is a separate entity 
* **SQM** mines lithium in CHILE

Since NLC is going to be operating in Argentina, the main competitor is FMC Corp. FMC Corp is a big company, however they operate in an area hundreds of miles away from where NLC is going to be mining. Also mentioned above, NLC owns 100% of the massive area where they operate, so it's almost safe to say that FMC Corp will not be a huge risk in terms of generating profit

**Risk #3 - Switch from Lithium batteries to some other variant**

This risk is close to impossible from happening, however there's a sliver of a chance that some big, blockbuster switch from lithium batteries to some other compound occurs, where most lithium mining companies would be heavily impacted. I highly, highly doubt this is going to happen in the next 2-3 years, so its a very small risk.

Well, this is the end of my DD. Please feel free to comment your thoughts, ask questions, or call something out I may have missed/overlooked. I'm no JPM analyst, just a 20 year old trying to make some money.",2020-12-28,24,28

jlv0kt_AXP,AXP,"Visa, Mastercard and Amex profits hit by lack of international travel during pandemic","Global travel screeched to a halt during the pandemic, and it’s hurting credit card companies’ bottom line. 

[American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AXP), [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MA) and [Visa](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=V) all reported double-digit drops in profit for the recent quarter, compared to a year ago. The companies pointed to a plunge in international travel as borders remain closed during the pandemic. 

Visa was the latest major card company to report results on Wednesday. Cross-border transactions fell 29%, while Visa’s revenue in the quarter was down 17% from a year ago. The company did not give guidance based on uncertainty around the virus, but said the cross-border weakness remains a “significant and continued drag on revenue growth.” That will likely continue into 2021, according to Visa’s CFO Vasant Prabhu. 

“The cross-border recovery has been sluggish since borders remain closed, and there are significant impediments of crossing borders like quarantines and other such restrictions,” Prabhu said on a call with analysts Wednesday.

Visa rival Mastercard reported earnings Wednesday, with many of the same themes. Mastercard’s net income fell 28% year over year, and net revenue fell 14%, missing analysts’ expectations. The company reported a 36% drop in cross-border volumes, and did not forecast a rebound in travel spending anytime soon.

Shares of Mastercard have fared the worst in the past week, and are down 11% this week. Visa and American Express are down 8% and 10% this week, respectively.

Amex kicked off the card earnings on Friday with a 40% drop in profit from a year earlier. Travel and entertainment spending was down 69% year over year. While the company is “highly confident” that travel demand will return, “it will take a while,” American Express CFO Jeffrey Campbell told CNBC in a phone interview.

i6j8e3_V,V,"Unusual Option Flow Summary Week of August 3rd – ADBE, CNK, FB, MSFT, SDC, SNAP, V","Good morning fellas. Swaggy is back with a Sunday morning read and summary of unusual options activity for the week. I've highlighted some plays that came across as unusual based on how far OTM the bet was, the premium paid, and the volume of contracts in the play. If you want to check out additional tickers for yourself, you can scan the [unusual option flow tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I use at your liking (it's free).

**ADBE – Adobe**

Saw a bullish position in ADBE being opened with a debit spread. My scanner missed the long leg being opened, but I managed to catch the play by digging deeper. I’ve added the OI from Yahoo Finance so you can see the contracts. Stock is currently sitting at $450 after Friday’s -3% move. The debit spread was in October’s $450 strike (long leg) and sold the $490 strike (short leg). Earnings aren’t until September 15.

https://preview.redd.it/c5zwew1t8zf51.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aeb0137a19b57af372a8bc574686146ec796933b

**CNK – Cinemark**

A bit of an unusual ticker for unusual activity. Cinemark saw some pretty heavy call buying on Friday. The stock has been on a bit of a run recently. One player bought calls 80% OTM for the $20 strike (stock is currently $11). This play was only $55k, but highly suspect with how far out the money they went. The play has an expiration date for September 18. I’ve attached Yahoo Finance option chain for August 21 so you can see the heavy volume in the near OTM strikes. This stock typically does not have high volume with options.

https://preview.redd.it/xfl6sgou8zf51.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c240cd54686a66f589a3733cc3a44437c29467d

**FB – Facebook**

Facebook had a huge melt up Thursday and Friday. Volume on option activity was well above the average for the last 2 weeks. Saw a good amount of CALL buying with some CALL selling far OTM as well. Most of the call selling (potentially covered calls?) were done with expirations in the next 1-3 weeks. The call buying had expirations toward the end of the year and even into 2021. Long-term bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/h59saplv8zf51.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36f92032e3c7444ec4f41e4a83bc22468518393

**MSFT – MicroTok**

Microsoft saw a massive bullish debit spread opened in November 2020 calls. 75,000 CALL contracts bought with the $220 strike while selling 75,000 CALL contracts at the $240 strike. Looks like the player/fund is expecting upside, but wanted to limit their downside by opening a spread. They have a max risk of $49 million with a max reward of $150 million if MSFT closes above $240 by November.

https://preview.redd.it/804hwqew8zf51.png?width=2858&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f76633f4b0db8220a1d1053daa8f54f5b796121

**SDC – Smile Direct Club**

Another unusual ticker, this stock saw some unusual call buying recently. Two trades in particular were for next week’s earnings report (August 12). Both trades are for $9 strike, which is currently in-the-money. When the trades were initiated the stock was trading at $8.82. Judging from the OI it looks like of the 16k contracts traded, only 10k are left on the Open Interest. He may have sold part of his position to collect profit, but left a lot on the table for next week.

https://preview.redd.it/m4ish39x8zf51.png?width=2740&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d9b879e6326f3a90959a6c2e9087da82ab9c1c

**Snap – Snapchat**

Snap saw extremely high volume of call options traded relative to it’s average. Bullish flow out-weighed bearish flow by 3.5 to 1. Could be potential TikTok play as they expect the ban to increase their own share. There’s was a lot of flow to go through on this ticker, so I’m only mentioning that flow in general was above the average here and also more on the bullish side.

https://preview.redd.it/iy8yygxx8zf51.png?width=2858&format=png&auto=webp&s=a02ccb95317ec638ac9566cbae050a86c6067d22

**V – Visa**

Visa saw some unusual option flow last week on Wednesday. That day alone the stock gapped up 2% and closed another 3% higher. Stock is currently trading at $196 and most of the call blocks had strikes of $202.5-$205. Visa generally does not have that much volume on option flow so it’s always interesting to keep an eye on. If you look at the price action of the stock is has been in range-bound trading in the $190-$200 channel for almost 3 months now. Hit’s $200 and drops back down to $190, then touches $190 and makes it’s way back up to $200. Maybe some flow rolling through will be enough to have it break out.

**V – Visa**

Visa saw some unusual option flow last week on Wednesday. That day alone the stock gapped up 2% and closed another 3% higher. Stock is currently trading at $196 and most of the call blocks had strikes of $202.5-$205. Visa generally does not have that much volume on option flow so it’s always interesting to keep an eye on. If you look at the price action of the stock is has been in range-bound trading in the $190-$200 channel for almost 3 months now. Hit’s $200 and drops back down to $190, then touches $190 and makes it’s way back up to $200. Maybe some flow rolling through will be enough to have it break out.

>  
>Shares [**V,** **-0.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/V?mod=MW_story_quote) were off 1% in after-hours trading.  
>  
>The **company posted net income of $2.4 billion, or $1.07 a share, down from $3.1 billion, or $1.37 a share, in the year-prior quarter**. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.06 a share, whereas analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $1.03 a share.  
>  
>**Visa’s revenue fell to $4.84 billion from $5.84 billion**, while the FactSet consensus called for $4.82 billion. **Payment volume dropped 10% for the quarter, while cross-border volume was off 37%**. Excluding intra-Europe transactions, cross-border volume fell 47%.  
>  
>The company said in its earnings release that it saw spending improve in each month of the fiscal third quarter as more countries began easing coronavirus-related restrictions on economic activity. Payments volume “meaningfully improved” in the U.S. as the quarter wore on, giving a boost to card-present spending as e-commerce spending “remained consistently elevated,” backing out travel-related spending.  
>  
>Processed transactions dropped 13% in the quarter on a global basis. Visa said that this metric has lagged volume growth “as the mix of spending shifted away from smaller transactions.” Cross-border volume “has improved only marginally through the quarter” given continued restrictions on travel, a key source of this sort of spending activity.  
>  
>Management isn’t providing an outlook for the full fiscal year given the uncertainties around COVID-19.

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■",2020-05-08,540,137

g4cbd3_V,V,COVID-19: The Transient v Permanent Impacts,"In the interest of engaging in some high level discussion, of the many changes wrought by CV which are transient and which, even if transient, will result in permanent changes to the investing landscape?

This is not about which stocks to buy or not and not about whether to invest in stocks v bonds v options v warrants v prefs etc. This is about discussing the changes in business dynamics in the broad sense. For example, will businesses continue with large scale work from home strategies even after lockdowns? Will people, having sat in isolation for 2-3 months begin using less at home entertainment? if so, how much of that will be a permanent behavioural shift. 

I know none of these have answers. I don't want answers. I want a discussion because I have my theories and want to know how others think. 

To kick things off:

- I think the work from home thing will not be a permanent shift. I think this because, at least in my industry (law), people seem to crave social interaction. It is evident in the weekly conference calls we now have. Those calls are really just a flimsy excuse for casual banter. Arguably, you could drop the facade but doing so is not likely to be acceptable in the longer run. Moreover, quite a few people have voiced irritation with the fact that if you work from home, you're never not at work and days have no structure. To an extent I think it would be easier to have structure if you can leave home to go to the gym etc. but if you're always at home, there is a lost mental switch of sorts, both for you and for those giving you work.

cvednx_V,V,BTC .v. FIAT,"If you look at gold this year, gold has done very well, it’s up 17%, breaking out to a multiyear high. Gold bugs are popping champagne bottles, and dancing in the streets in utter glee, as they should. They’ve had to be very patient in the gold market, and it’s wonderful for gold investors that they’re finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel and not another oncoming train.

Let’s put that into perspective from valley to peak. Bitcoin, over the same period of time, has been up well over 300%. So, in terms of bitcoin as a tool for a store of value, as a hedge against an erosion in value of paper money…

Because, that’s what the world is afraid of right now. They’re afraid that we have so much fiat currency in the world, that you have $15 trillion of bonds trading at a negative yield. Which means the borrowers—the people who are borrowing—are getting paid to borrow. That’s insane. It’s nuts.

It is an indictment on the way the world views fiat currency. There’s a reason why central banks are buying more gold now than in any other time in my lifetime. (I’m almost 50.) It’s because they are—in my opinion—enacting one of the greatest thefts in human history. They are taking essentially worthless bits of paper that they print and have complete control over, and they are exchanging essentially cowry shells for something that has real value. And that is gold.

You have to ask yourself, why are they doing that? They are doing that, because I believe the fundamental value of fiat currency will erode and will erode traumatically. It will be something that you just wake up… and it happens.",2019-08-25,2,1

Here is the [link](https://www.canadianinsider.com/node/7?menu_tickersearch=FIRE+%7C+The+Supreme+Cannabis+Co) to the insider buying transactions at the open market. Obviously something is brewing to see that type of activity so close to each other by at least the two top dogs at Supreme Cannabis.

&#x200B;

What we do know are the following upcoming catalysts:

1. HC inspection of additional 12 newly completed cultivation rooms (120,000sq.ft addition)
2. Official date of TSX uplisting (conditional approval was given early last week)
3. Q2 financials due Feb 28 (but that may change to Feb 14 if they uplist to TSX prior)
4. Completion and approval of remaining rooms by March 2019.

a5nebw_V,V,2nd Circuit Court of Appeals: Washington v. Sessions - Incredible questions from the appellate judges,"This morning I attended the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals oral argument heard by Judges Jacobs, Calabresi, and Rakoff (by designation) in the Washington v. Sessions case. 

Counsel for the Plaintiffs/Appellants Michael Hiller masterfully explained the constitutional challenge to the Schedule 1 classification of 'marihuana.' He told the Court:  2.1 million US patients rely on medical cannabis to treat illnesses and ailments; the child Plaintiffs' 'right to life' is infringed; Judge Hellerstein (lower court) said there was no question on the merits; 33 states have legalized medical cannabis; and the US government holds medical cannabis patents.

It is impossible to predict how the Court will decide but the questions from the panel of judges were truly remarkable:

--Jacobs: ""We have a situation where one part of the government [FDA] said it's a medicine and another part of the government [DEA] says it's a crime to use?""

--Calabresi: ""Should the Court tell the FDA/DEA to expedite a review of cannabis, i.e. tell the agencies that Schedule 1 will be ruled unconstitutional so the agencies should take expedited action?""

--Rakoff: ""The usefulness of cannabis for medicine has been known for decades. Why can't the Court take judicial notice that medical use of cannabis is proven?""

8kslmu_V,V,Organigram (OGI.V): A Review of Recent News and Technical Analysis,"*On recent expansion news:*

Forward thinking like this is what's separating the mass small fry companies from the industry leaders. In a few years I believe there will be 5\-10 companies running show, on a domestic and international scale. It's what happens **now** that determines how those companies are positioned in the future.

Greg Engel, CEO, makes some great points:

1. OGI will have a massive advantage right off the hop. 36,000KG/year rate ready for REC. 2nd highest in the industry. The result of work/planning that OGI did years ago. They focused on building their indoor grow to what it is now, and weren't necessarily spreading their money on various investments. Targeted goals. Now, with the first supplier advantage, they're looking at the saturated market in Canada \- estimated in the next 2\-5 years. As such, they're forward looking to the international market.
2. Organigram is *Testing* the international markets in these early stages. This is nothing but important, in these early stages they'l look to see which markets they can achieve the largest profit, and exactly how to expand accordingly. They're not blindly committing to massive deals without knowing the markets. And they get to save their bulk of inventory for the Canadian market becoming legal.
3. They have close to 1/3rd of their market cap, 177 Mil in cash in the bank, of that, 115m ready for an opportunity they see fit.
4. They haven't locked up a huge amount of their inventory to provincial or other supply deals. While locking up some of their distribution networks is important, tying up the majority of it it could be a mistake. There's going to be a shortage of supply come August 1st\- no doubt about it. OGI will have their pick of where they want to sell their product and at choice prices \- think online ordering. Ontario alone will have only 40 stores total.. Majority of people will be ordering online.

The below quotes strengthen my belief in management. Taken from the recent CBC article.

>""Which means that at some point, the volume supply will catch up with the anticipated demand, especially in the adult \[recreational\] market, so we're just looking down the road.""  
>  
>It's hard to determine at this point exactly how much revenue the company could make from exports  
>  
>In any case, the company wants to be ready for any opportunity that arises, he said.""We're planting seeds and building relationships and understanding what the dynamics of each of these markets are, so when there comes an opportunity for Organigram to enter that market, we'll be ready,"" he said.

***Looking at the Charts***

Technical Analysis of Organigram \(OGI.V\).

You can view the Weekly and Daily charts at the following link:[http://stockcharts.com/h\-sc/ui](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui)Type in OGI.V at the top, and select DAILY view first.

If you want to scroll dates farther back, extend the ""Chart Attributes"" to X years. Make sure MACD is one of your indicators.

**Daily:**

Another *PERFECT* Bull Flag established, as predicted in my last TA post a few days ago. You can view it here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/8jxui9/easy\_technical\_analysis\_macds\_and\_bull\_flags/](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/8jxui9/easy_technical_analysis_macds_and_bull_flags/)

We closed near the high of the previous flag at $4.82, which was created on May 14th. Were looking for yet another leg up this week, and I anticipate OGI coming close to or touching and rejecting it's **All Time High** this week. Following that will be low volume consolidation yet again, then rinse and repeat. We should be creating a NEW All time high in correlation with the June 7th vote.

**Weekly**

Weekly MACD should be crossing positive on Tuesday when Canadian markets open. Please view my above link to see my analysis of the likely results of this cross. This is HUGE for OGI and the sector.

Keep in mind WEED, APH, and many others are also being turns in the WEEKLY maid, looking to cross in the week or two. But OGI will cross first. Keep in mind THCX already crossed, MACD positive on the weekly. The day it crossed, THCX touched it's  ALL TIME HIGH. Now it's consolidating before probably breaking out bluesky on Tuesday. Major markets are also seing a turn in Weekly MACD. When these cross, it will rally as well and bring the industry up yet again.",2018-05-20,54,14

I'm looking to do an introductory course into algo trading with machine learning, and I'm tossing up between learning Python or R. I've previously used R for basic data analysis, \(which I preferred over Python\) however I can't say I'm proficient with it. Here are the courses I'm considering:

I am looking at investing, for long-term growth, in either Visa or American Express. Visa overall looks like it has a better and stronger company with more net income, a greater 3 and 5 year dividend increase and has a large portion of the global market share. American Express does not seem to be as strong but it is the most popular credit card, according to google statistics, in US, India, and China. These are 3 very strong and growing economies. Keep in mind I am keeping this as growth for at least 10 years.

7vtmry_IBM,IBM,The right time to by this blockchain stock (TSX.V LTV),"TL;DR version:

LeoNovus is a provider of solutions to cloud data storage using blockchain technology. It was included as a major underlying component in a recently launched blockchain ETF. Blockchain stocks are all the hype, but LTV actually has solid fundamentals. It currently has projects with government of Canada, large Canadian bank, and a Canadian college. It is currently on a hot hiring spree for more software engineers as it vamps up its platform and take up more projects (just google LeoNovus careers). For more info on their recent accomplishments, check out the list on the bottom! If you want to invest in blockchain companies without trading cryptos, LTV is one of your best bets! 

Long version:

A year ago today, bitcoin was at $1025USD, ethereum was at $11.3USD, NEO was not even a thing… Even with the current crypto market sell off, if you have bought bitcoin and ethereum a year ago, you are still up 580% and 5800% on your investments, respectively. However, don’t beat yourself too hard if you have missed the crypto rally. There are still other opportunities, namely the rise of the blockchain technology.

You may wonder isn’t betting on cryptocurrencies the same as betting on blockchain technologies. Not really. Why?

1)   **Not every blockchain needs a native currency.** There are two types of blockchain – public and private. The difference between public and private blockchains is similar to the differences between Internet and intranet. The Internet is an open public space that anyone can tap into, while an intranet is designed to be a private space. Both bitcoin and ethereum are public blockchains. All transactions on a blockchain must be validated and embedded in data blocks, which essentially form the blockchain. Since the creators of public blockchains likely do not have the processing capabilities to handle all the transactions alone, miners step in. Miners on public blockchains need a reward for verifying transactions, therefore, cryptocurrencies are necessary for the operations of public blockchains. On the other hand, private blockchains are internal networks that are tightly controlled and do not require the need for a robust network of miners to verify transactions/blocks. Private blockchains are primarily used for business application where access to the chain is limited to certain parties. Cryptocurrencies are not a necessary component for most private blockchains.

2)   **Regulators are keeping their eyes close to cryptocurrencies and are trying to regulate them. However, they have shown very supportive attitude towards the development of blockchain technologies.** At this point, the consensus view is that: at some point down the road, blockchain will revolutionize part of, if not the whole, society. Regulators may frown upon cryptocurrencies given their speculative nature, but they have also come to realize that they cannot afford not to embrace blockchain technologies. In December 2017, Janet Yellen called bitcoin as a “highly speculative asset”. As to a government-issued digital currencies, she commented ”While we’re looking at research on this topic, there are, I think to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a limited need for it and some substantial concerns.” Blockchain technologies have definitely started being adopted across multiple departments in the US government. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, The Department of Defense Transportation Command, The Food & Drug Administration all have issued notices saying they would looking into potential application of blockchain technologies.

Why should you invest in blockchain technology stocks?

1)  **Blockchain technology is not a fad.** Many of the applications have passed the proof-of-concept stage, and started being adopted for social and business uses.

2)  **It is investing in the next “big thing”.** Talking about blockchain today is like talking about the Internet back in the 90s – it is just difficult for people to imagine its specific applications. But most of us can see it being broadly applied.

3)  **Unlike cryptocurrencies which are highly speculative, the development of blockchain technology has its fundamentals.** So far, it has been hard if not impossible to time all the cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, investing in blockchain stocks comes down to understanding applications of the technology and evaluating businesses, which can be much more predictable. 

4) You may say, well, a lot of this blockchain stocks sell off when the cryptocurrency market melts. True. But investors panicking over their blockchain stock holdings when the cryptocurrencies are down just indicates how naïve those investors are – they look at blockchain stocks as another way to profit on cryptocurrencies, which is totally wrong. **And if anything, it means opportunities for better educated investors.**

5)  **Opportunities are yet to come.** The realm of public blockchains and their native assets is most relevant to the innovative investor at this stage. Private blockchains have not yield an entirely new asset class that is investable to the public. However, with the rise of blockchain technology, I believe this will come, and it will create new investment opportunities.


That being said, don’t just throw your money into any start-up companies that have the word ""blockchain"" in their names. There are a ton of garbage stocks out there doing nothing in blockchain and just waiting to monetize on stockholders’ hard-earned money. 

Investing in blockchain technology stocks is no easy task, it requires a lot of due diligence. One of the most basic questions investors need to ask is: Does the blockchain technology project make sense? This applies to both public and private blockchains. For example, STEEM is a public blockchain many investors are familiar with (Currently, it is among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap.) STEEM aims to offer a blockchain-based social media platform, where users can earn rewards through activities such as posting. But, think for a second. Do we need a decentralized Facebook? If not, well, this is exactly what STEEM does. This spells out the biggest challenge many investors face. **We all agree that blockchain will become a big thing, but not every company needs to get on a blockchain and not every company will benefit from a decentralized system.** Unless the management actually understands blockchain technology and how their company in particular will benefit from it, many of their new initiative on blockchain could just be noise. And it is investors' job to filter through it.

Moreover, don’t expect a 200% return on your blockchain technology stocks in a year if you invest in the companies like Intel, Amazon or Walmart. I get it, all of the giants have said they are engaging in blockchain, and I believe they have the ability to come up with interesting things. But how much of they company earnings will be driven by the blockchain initiatives? And what’s the fraction of that will be translated into their stock prices? Tiny, probably.

So, after all this talk, here is one stock I like a lot - LeoNovus (TSX.V: LTV). I have been following the stock for four months now. The company has undergone rapid growth in the one year time since it launched its first product. The company is offering specific solutions to cloud data storage using blockchain technology - this project has broad applications; and cloud data storage can be truly made more secure yet accessible with blockchain technology. On the technical front, LTV is partnering with DTL Labs, the company behind Enterprise Ethereum, IBM’s Fabric, R3’s Corda, and JP Morgan’s Quorum. On the application front, LTV has signed contracts with the Government of Canada, one of the Canadian leading banks, a leading Canadian college, and a global healthcare data provider to install their platform. As a start-up company that only started selling its products less than a year ago, these are significant achievements. The stock has been recently sold off a lot with the broader crypto sell off, even on the backdrop of great new developments. To me this is a buying opportunity. 


For more details on the company, keep reading...

Leonovus is a blockchain-hardened software-defined cloud storage solutions provider for enterprise. Their patented algorithms virtualize, transform, slice and disperse data across a network of on-premises, hybrid or multi-cloud storage nodes, which allows for secure object-based data storage that across the entire solution. The architecture is designed to minimize latency, optimize availability, reduce remote backup costs and meet data sovereignty requirements.

They have strong management team! I dug in on their employees profile and found most of them have strong IT architecture and software background, this is especially true for those who at the top of the company structure. So many of the start-up blockchain companies are ran by people in the financial industry. Well, no offense, as I am also one of the capital market employees, but really, how much do we actually know about the technicals to develop a great blockchain project. Very little I would say.

Leonovus launched its first product at the beginning of 2017. Within one year, the company has undergone rapid growth in product development, sales, as well as partnership. Here is a timeline of major events:
January 10, 2017 - Leonovus launched its software-defined object storage solution solving security and compliance requirements for enterprise cloud storage. The solution is designed to bring enterprise cloud users an increased level of data security, recoverability and compliance across any combination of cloud storage solutions. The solution is hardware and software agnostic, which cuts implementation costs for enterprise. As an Oracle Gold Cloud Partner, Leonovus complements Oracle’s storage solution offerings by bringing GRC (governance, risk management and compliance) to Oracle’s IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud storage solutions and providing a foundation for enhanced GRC in all of Oracle’s cloud PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions.

January 30, 2017 - The software-defined object storage solution is in trials by one of the largest public colleges in North America to ensure its sensitive data meets compliance standards and remains secure within the cloud. Leonovus will begin with the institution’s multi-cloud environment in late February 2017, with the potential of being implemented into the other 24 post-secondary schools within its peer network over the next 24 months.

June 21, 2017 - The new product, Leonovus 365, targets the installed base of 89 million Microsoft 365 users. It provides Microsoft 365 with advanced security and compliance features, and it can pool the cloud storage from all the OneDrive licenses into one managed cloud storage instance. Users are able to achieve advanced collaboration in Leonovus 365.

September 26, 2017 - Leonovus announced enhancements to its existing data storage solution via the integration of blockchain technology. The company’s core technologies offer scalable distributed data storage with improved security, governance, and compliance while reducing costs, risk and providing additional defense against cybersecurity threats. The utilization of blockchain technology further enhances its effectiveness. The company’s previous adoption of blockchain technologies:


1st - In 2014, the company produced and deployed a managed, loosely-coupled blockchain computation pool built from available idle resources. The system managed both public and private blockchain computation on thousands of low/no-cost computing cores across North America with only a few clicks of a mouse from a browser-based dashboard.

2nd - In 2014, the company leveraged its proprietary distributed computing technology to mine digital currency from low-end distributed devices.

October 4, 2017 - Leonovus partnered with DLT Labs to accelerate the engineering of the blockchain components of the storage solution. DLT Labs is a global leader in implementing permissioned and non-permissioned blockchain solutions for enterprises. The Lab has extensive enterprise experience and expertise with all distributed ledger/blockchain technologies including Enterprise Ethereum, IBM’s Fabric, R3’s Corda, JP Morgan’s Quorum, and etc.. During one interview with DLT Labs, they expressed firm belief that Leonovus would continue market leadership in the field.

October 23, 2017 - Leonovus signed a proof of concept agreement with one of Canada’s “big six” banks (For those who live in the U.S., Canadian banking sector is entirely dominated by the six biggest banks, and there are not regional banks.) Leonovus will install its blockchain-hardened software to assist the bank in developing a multi-site data storage management fabric with data security, performance and compliance metrics that meet the bank’s data governance policies. Leonovus will also help the bank to leverage and maximize its current storage assets to form a secure and compliant private cloud storage network that will dramatically reduce data storage costs while increasing data security.

November 3, 2017 - Leonovus signed a proof of concept agreement with a global health data services company. This project will help deliver an improved user experience to the 20,000 Citrix users. This project came from the challenge that data may reside in different geographical business zones. As such a business user who lives in the North American Zone may have to log in and pull a file back from the European Zone. Due to inter-continental latencies, pulling in data from another geographic zone provides the end user with a poor experience, causing frustration and potential delays. Leonovus blockchain-hardened can be the solution to this problem.

January 24, 2017 - After four months of technical and market evaluation by the Government of Canada (GOC), Leonovus is pre-qualified to receive up to $500,000 purchase order from the GOC. The next step is to choose the sponsoring GOC department. There is potential for three additional $500,000 purchase orders in 2018, paid from departmental budgets.

Other than the above-mentioned breakthroughs, Leonovus has committed to many new partnerships with established companies in IT infrastructure services, cyber security, and data providers, to further access the total market for the technology. These companies include: ZoneTI (Canada-based), Snowy River International (Canada-based), Storage Made Easy (UK-based), FlexTy Solutions Inc. (Canada-based), ApexIT (US-based).

Back in June 2017, Leonovus has started to follow Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), which is a joint American and Canadian security accreditation program for cryptographic modules. The program is for vendors who seek to have their products certified for use by the U.S./Canadian Government and regulated industries that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate ""sensitive, but not classified"" information. The certification process is expected to be completed in eight to twelve months. This will help broaden the use of Leonovus’ products.



Last but probably the best point to buy LTV today is... 

A momentum trade is also likely to push LTV stock higher tomorrow. The very first Canadian blockchain technology ETF (TSX: HBLK) is about to start trading on Feb 7th, 2018. LTV has a significant weight in the ETF portfolio. Given the high demand in blockchain ETFs, I expect the ETF will start trading with high buying volume. For each unit of the ETF sold, the ETF provider needs to go buy the corresponding number of underlying stocks to back it up. For emerging companies such as LTV, if the ETF has high trading volume, it will definitely drive up the demand for the stocks.
Just to give you a rough measure. When the first marijuana ETF (TSX: HMMJ) hit the Canadian market back in April 2017, we witness some smaller names in the portfolio getting pushed up 20% in the week following the launch. And HMMJ marked the top net inflow ETF in Canada in 2017.",2018-02-07,0,2

It's odd that Visa's not regarded as a Financial Services business but an Industrial company! But maybe that's how it justified 25x earnings versus boring old banks and insurance companies!

# Description

Almost silly of me to give a description eh? Still

* Visa is a payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities to electronic payments. 
* The Company's transaction processing network facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a range of products, platforms and value-added services. 
* The Company is a retail electronic payment network based on payments volume, number of transactions and number of cards in circulation. 
* Its products/services include core products, processing infrastructure, transaction processing services, digital products, merchant products, and risk products and payment security initiatives.

It's an oligopoly with Mastercard in Europe and the Americas and has started to penetrate other markets like Japan where there are local leaders, though the Chinese market looks like it is still closed to them. :( 

## Recent financials 

Oddly, it's got a Sept year end, and note that Visa Inc bought Visa Europe in June 2016, so we should see a nice jump in the figures in the coming year, as the European data gets included.

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $15bn | $14bn | $13bn | $12bn | $10bn|
|EPS | $2.48 | $2.58 | $2.16 | $1.90 | $0.79|

For example the forecast for the year to Sept 2017 is $18bn of sales v $15bn last year. 

## Competition

When it comes to competition, there is cash, cheque, direct bank transfers, and then a range of alternative to Visa. But if we look at the math... no one comes close.

||Visa|MasterCard|Amex|JCD|Discover/ Diners|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Volume | $9,905bn | $4,564bn | $1,040bn | $207bn | $154bn|
|Cards | 3,009m | 1,574m | 118m | 94m | 58m|

It's hard to see where the threat is, as money gets increasingly digitized across the globe. And please don't say ""Bitcoin"" ;).

So with twice the cards and volume, it's no surprise that Visa is 2x Mastercard on sales. Plus it's scale affords it best margins in the industry. Though only MA and DFS are direct comparisons. Amex, PYPL, etc aren't exact matches, even if they compete tangentially with V.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Visa Inc | $15,082M | 68% | 21%
American Express Company | $33,076M | 27% | 25%
Discover Financial Services | $8,419M | 55% | 21%
Mastercard Inc | $10,537M | 56% | 64%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $10,417M | 21% | 10%
Alliance Data Systems Corporation | $7,059M | 28% | 30%
Fiserv Inc | $5,442M | 30% | 33%
Global Payments Inc | $3,089M | 21% | 15%

## Cash / Debt?

Visa Inc has $12,661M of net debt. That is 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So nothing to get fussed about. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $94.25 for Visa Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 15% to their target.

# Valuation

Okay, it's the giant, it bought out the EU unit, and got the scale the others haven't. But does $V and $MA for that matter, deserve the valuation of a tech giant? Is its outlook as rosy as Paypal's? It appears the market thinks so.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/v/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
V | $191,295M | 25x | 16% | 1% | 3%
AXP | $69,074M | 13x | 7% | 2% | 5%
DFS | $28,420M | 13x | 8% | 2% | 10%
MA | $117,417M | 29x | 15% | 1% | 4%
PYPL.O | $50,015M | 28x | 17% | 0% | 4%
ADS | $13,650M | 14x | 12% | 0% | 8%
FISV.O | $23,839M | 25x | 13% | 0% | 4%
GPN | $11,443M | 21x | 23% | 0% | 5%

If fact the thing I don't get is why $AXP and $DFS are only on 13x earnings. Is there growth so lackluster? Anyone?

# Dividends

Visa Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.66 per share, compared a forecast EPS of $3.28. So plenty of room there for the recently authorized $5bn re-purchase program!

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -1% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 18%. So the valuation's come in as we rolled forward a fiscal year from 29x to 25x. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they gave a rosy outlook

> We feel good about fiscal year 2017. The Visa Europe integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally. Transactions growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing.

So, steady as she goes! Looks like $V is a Quality stock, even if it's not cheap. So a boring but good stock anyone?

5f1d24_V,V,Is Pharmacan/Cronos/$MJN.V Severely Undervalued? I think it is.,"Okay so, bear with me here, as I've been doing a lot of research on this company over the past couple of months and think there is truly a hidden gem here. MJN.V currently trading as Pharmacan Capital Corp at $1.55 is undervalued and here's why I think so:

First off, company website: http://thecronosgroup.com/

With the exception of CGC, unlike most of the other pure LP players in Canada, MJN is a ""holding"" company that owns several LP's under them.
Their current core assets are the following:

- Peace Naturals (https://peacenaturals.com/) **100% ownership stake. This is the big one we need to focus on**

- In the Zone (http://www.inthezoneproduce.com/) **100%ownership stake**

- Whistler Medical Marijuana Corp (https://whistlermedicalmarijuana.com/) 21.5% ownership stake


Apart from their core assets, it looks like MJN is also ""strategically"" invested in the following companies:

- ABCann (currently licensed with an ACMPR)
- Hydropothecary (currently licensed with an ACMPR)
- Evergreen (Currently a ACMPR applicant)

Back to Peace Naturals.  As of September 6th, Cronos (then Pharmacan) completed a deal that allowed them to net 100% ownership of Peace Naturals. Why is this a big deal? Because PN was the first new LP to be given a MMPR license by Health Canada. 
Prior to being wholly owned by Cronos, Peace Naturals has never disclosed their total patient count. That's all set to change in the near future(possibly next week) as Cronos announces its quarterly earnings and we finally get to see what Peace Naturals has been up to for the past 3 years since receiving their license.
While details so far about Peace Naturals annual growing haul have been scarce, we know they have approximately ~95 acres of land. Combined with ITZ which has ~14 acres of land, that puts MJN higher than almost all other LP's in Canada (apart from CGC) currently producing MJ

So, back to MJN. Why do I think they're currently heavily undervalued? They currently have a market cap of ~$115 million. Currently, we have unliscened producers like Supreme Pharmaceuticals ($SL) at a market cap of ~$200 million and  smaller LP's like Emerald Health(EMF) at ~$75 million. Looking at the numbers, it's hard to argue that a company that wholly owns a long established LP is undervalued
At this point, we still don't know the moves behind the scenes that MJN is trying to make. What we do know is that they recently signed a deal with XIB Consulting, a public PR firm. Who else has a deal with XIB you ask? Just CGC and OGI. 

Personally, I think it would be a great move if they can make a play to have higher ownership stake in WMMC. WMMC  is Fraser Valley Organic Producers Association Certified, which means they would be in direct competition with Organigram for producing ""Organic"" MJ. 

Now, where do I think MJN belongs in relation to the current LP players? Well, they are certainly no CGC. They are however in my opinion, on-par with the ""smaller"" big boys like Mettrum, Organigram, and Aurora. In other words, I'd say COMA should be COMMA instead. 

**Short Term:**  If investors get a good earnings report soon, I feel this price can surge to $3-3.50 to be on par with some of the other LP's. Combined with positive Task Force reportings, I can easily see this stock reaching somewhere in the $5 range

**Long Term:** Who knows where we'll be, but I still stand by my opinion that this company has the potential of being valued as the other big ""COMA"" stocks

Let me know what your thoughts are on this. Good or bad.

**Side Note for everyone whether you're intrigured by this company or not.**
There's a lot of stuff still in the air about this industry, but I feel like we are lucky enough to be at the ground level of a multi-billion dollar industry. Regardless of which horse you've got your money on I feel like the big LP's in Canada are going to BOOM over the next 2-10 years. Good luck to everyone :)

[Mean reversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reversion_(finance) is probably the most powerful long term force in finance. So with the Fed tightening cycle creeping up on us... should we be cautious about the high flier Defensives?

Or am I totally missing the point?

* low  / declining interest rates = overweight defensives as the economy is in trouble / in need of repair
* tightening cycle = the economy is back to boom time, invest in cyclicals

How are you squaring the circle?
