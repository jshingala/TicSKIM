1khpl2n_WBD,WBD,Warner Bros Discovery misses revenue estimates on box office weakness,"https://stocks.apple.com/AV2Irp1ZHQ2eG8M_0a9BnNg

Summary
Quarterly studios revenue declines 18% after 'Mickey 17' underperforms
Streaming subscriber gains of 5.3 million far exceed estimates
Cable TV unit revenue falls 7% as cord-cutting continues
Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) missed first-quarter revenue estimates on Thursday, weighed down by a lack of big box office hits from its studios and weakness in its traditional TV business as consumers continued to abandon cable for streaming.
Like others in the media business, Warner Bros Discovery is losing thousands of cable TV subscribers each year, putting pressure on the company to consistently produce hit content and boost profitability in its streaming business.
The threat of U.S. tariffs on foreign-made films has also added to the headaches of an industry whose biggest-budget films are often produced across several continents.
WBD struggled in the January-March quarter to replicate the success of last year's ""Dune: Part Two,"" which grossed more than $700 million. The company's marquee release for the period, Bong Joon Ho's sci-fi dark comedy ""Mickey 17,"" earned only slightly more than its reported budget at the box office.
That meant studios revenue fell 18% to $2.31 billion, missing estimates of $2.73 billion, according to Visible Alpha.
The company has, however, made a strong start to the second quarter with Ryan Coogler's horror film ""Sinners"" and the blockbuster ""A Minecraft Movie,"" which has raked in around $900 million globally, making it the biggest release of 2025 so far. Its summer lineup also looks strong with ""Superman,"" directed by Marvel's long-time hitmaker James Gunn, set to release in July.
Revenue at the TV networks segment, which includes CNN, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, fell 7%, with advertising revenue in the business declining 12% as marketers avoided cable TV amid cord-cutting by subscribers.
Overall, revenue fell 10% in the first three months of 2025 to $8.98 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $9.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Loss of 18 cents per share was also larger than expectations for a 13-cent loss, even as costs declined 11.8%.
The company's shares were down 1.9% in premarket trading.
Still, its streaming business was a bright spot.
WBD added 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, compared with 3.1 million estimated by analysts, according to Visible Alpha, taking its total to 122.3 million. The quarter featured some strong content slate including the third season of HBO's ""The White Lotus"" and the medical drama series ""The Pitt"".
The company also launched its Max streaming service in Australia earlier this year, following rollouts in more than 70 countries across Europe and Asia last year. Analysts say it has also benefited and reduced churn thanks to a streaming bundle combining Disney+, Hulu and Max that was introduced last year.

Fourth-quarter revenue for the streaming segment, which is anchored by flagship service Max, totaled $2.65 billion, up 5% from $2.53 billion in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the unit came in at $409 million, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

In a shareholder letter, the company forecast adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion for its streaming business for the year ‚Äî roughly double the $677 million adjusted EBITDA it reported for 2024 ‚Äî and said it has a ‚Äúclear path‚Äù to hit 150 million global subscribers by the end of 2026. Max is set to launch on television service Sky in the United Kingdom and Ireland by the second quarter of 2026, and will debut in Germany and Italy in the first quarter of that year.

The media and entertainment company¬†announced¬†Wednesday that Max would keep its B/R Sports and CNN content available at no additional cost to subscribers in its standard and premium tiers. Initially WBD planned to charge an¬†additional cost for sports.

However, it will pull both verticals from its basic, ad-supported tier beginning March 30.

WBD‚Äôs overall fourth-quarter revenue fell 2% to $10.03 billion from $10.28 billion during the same quarter in 2023. Full-year 2024 revenue came in at $39.32 billion, down 5% from $41.32 billion in 2023.

Warner Bros. Discovery reported a net loss of $494 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, or a loss of 20 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $400 million, or a loss of 16 cents per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023.

TV networks revenue came in at $4.77 billion, compared to $5.04 billion in the year-earlier period. The company previously¬†wrote down¬†$9.1 billion for its networks business in its 2024 second-quarter earnings report. In its shareholder letter, Warner Bros. Discovery noted that it expects further declines in cable subscribers and that the advertising market for U.S. linear television is shrinking faster than expected.

For the studios business, fourth-quarter revenue totaled $3.66 billion, an increase of 15% from $3.17 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.

1ebcqra_WBD,WBD,"NBA says Amazon will be its new media partner, rebuffing WBD attempt to match deal ","The National Basketball Association has told Warner Bros. Discovery it doesn‚Äôt intend to honor its matching rights and instead plans to move ahead with Amazon as a media partner.

 ‚ÄúWarner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video‚Äôs offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,‚Äù the NBA said in a statement Wednesday.

 ‚ÄúThroughout these negotiations, our primary objective has been to maximize the reach and accessibility of our games for our fans. Our new arrangement with Amazon supports this goal by complementing the broadcast, cable and streaming packages that are already part of our new Disney and NBCUniversal arrangements,‚Äù the league added. ‚ÄúAll three partners have also committed substantial resources to promote the league and enhance the fan experience. We are grateful to Turner Sports for its award-winning coverage of the NBA and look forward to another season of the NBA on TNT.‚Äù

Warner Bros. Discovery said Monday it matched one of the NBA‚Äôs three media rights packages, which people familiar with the matter identified as the $1.93 billion per-year deal earmarked for Amazon Prime Video. Disney and Comcast‚Äôs NBCUniversal signed deals for the other two packages, part of the league‚Äôs $77 billion media rights renewal over 11 years.

‚ÄúIn an effort to continue our long-standing partnership, during both exclusive and non-exclusive negotiation periods, we acted in‚ÄØgood faith to‚ÄØpresent‚ÄØstrong bids that were fair to both parties. Regrettably,‚ÄØthe league notified us of its intention to accept other offers for the games in our current rights package, leaving us to proceed under the‚ÄØmatching rights provision, which is an integral part of our current agreement and the rights we have paid for under it,‚Äù Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement on Monday. ‚ÄØ‚ÄúThis will allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage, including the best live game productions in the industry and our iconic studio shows and talent, while building on our proven 40-year commitment for many more years.‚Äù

Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs Turner Sports has carried live NBA games for nearly 40 years. The cable network TNT is home to ‚ÄúInside the NBA,‚Äù the popular studio show starring Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal. The future of the show is in doubt if the NBA doesn‚Äôt strike a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery.

Warner Bros. Discovery acquired matching rights as part of its current media rights deal with the league, which expires at the end of next season. That provision allows the company to match payment for any of the games that air on TNT.

The NBA doesn‚Äôt believe Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs rights extend to an all-streaming package, as has been carved out for Amazon. Warner Bros. Discovery also owns a streaming service, Max, which it could use to air games.

Amazon Prime Video has more than twice as many global customers ‚Äî more than 200 million to Max‚Äôs roughly 100 million ‚Äî which may make the service a more appealing platform for the league. The streaming rights are global, even though Warner Bros. Discovery is only bidding on U.S. rights, according to people familiar with the language in the contract.

1dkakj0_WBD,WBD,"WBD , why they'll fail.","They do not care about the consumer. I just recently purchased multiple movies of theirs that were labeled as having a digital code. Which when I recieved then didn't have the little flyer in them that should contain the code. (Dune, Mad Max Fury Road, and Edge of Tomorrow btw) they won't give me a code because they said these products are Inelgible once they've expired even though there was no paper even with them and they are being advertised as having it!

It turns out after some more digging they are also the only company that LETS these codes expire in the movies they sell. 

If they can't provide the same level of service as competitors, why would anyone want to use their product? 

Needless to say I've cancelled my Max subscription that'd I've had for years. As they keep raising prices and are locking 4k behind an additional pay wall when it used to be the same tier (unlike Disney).",2024-06-20,0,25

1dd6fy1_WBD,WBD,The Regard case for WBD. Hear me out.,"I‚Äôm a full regard so I love garbage. WBD is such garbage stock. But there‚Äôs real treasure in the trash sometimes. Like some old lady buying a Picasso print at the thrift store for five bucks. Why is WBD treasure in the trash?

Okay so the entertainment business has been trash for a while now. Covid killed theaters, streaming is a trash business and is consolidating, the tech bros are going to ruin the movie business just like they ruin everything else. So the WBD stock is way down. A trash stock in a trash industry.

But what I like is the IP. It‚Äôs fucking WARNER BROS! It‚Äôs fucking HBO! It‚Äôs Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Batman, ~~TMNT~~, Dune, The Matrix, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, Barbie! These are iconic and beloved titles that will have huge value for the foreseeable future. Every time there‚Äôs a new streaming service, new video format, new theme park, new video game, new fucking slot machines, new anything, this IP will get monetized the fuck out it.¬† They own Police Academy which I know you love because you are in this sub like me.

And yes Zazlav is an asshole. It‚Äôs just what this dumb industry needs. An asshole BUSINESSMAN. Unemotional, cunning, cutthroat. Will break your heart by killing some superhero nerd fest for the sweet tax breaks. And he‚Äôs paying down debt like a beast. People in Hollywood hate him with a passion and that‚Äôs how you know he‚Äôs good.

So what‚Äôs the upshot? Well the intrinsic FCF value is $27. Current share price around 8?¬† For a ratio of .3. Historically, that is at the absolute low end. It‚Äôs been as high at 1.5 in the last ten years.¬†

Do I really understand any of that? Clearly not. Maybe all of this is bullshit. What am I a quant? I‚Äôm betting on the company being in a cyclical slump because of covid and strikes, with huge potential because of the IP and the leader not afraid to be a huge prick. Also the the historic median Price-to-Intrinsic-Value-Projected-FCF is .69 - which is good enough for me.

This motherfucker is beaten down and once it pays off the merger debt and the streaming consolidation settles, this dog will hunt. We‚Äôre talking at least $18 in the next twelve months. And the bear case is around $7. Huge upside, minimal downside.¬†

I know this is a gambling sub, but even in a casino you wanna find the roulette wheel with just one green and not those sucker ones with three.¬†

TL;DR - Huge IP value, ruthless asshole CEO, entertainment biz is shit right now but WB is iconic and will bounce back bigly.¬†

This is clearly not financial advise. I‚Äôm a dumbass creative and not some Wall Street douche. Tell me why I am wrong.",2024-06-11,40,36

So I have been waiting for WBD price to get back down to the 9.65 range because I knew if it ever did, it would set up a life changing trade. Here is the reason why. 

The WBD chart looks eerily similar to what the BTC chart looked like Jan 2023. 

The first chart pic is WBD currently (2.21.24). The second chart is BTC from its high, until it bottomed in Nov 2022. The last chart is BTC current day from the Nov 2022 low. BTC price has more than trippled. WBD will be at more than 3x simply by retracing to the .382 fib (roughly $35).

BTC had at least one retracement of .382 during its decline, WBD has NOT. If you know your TA and you see this chart, you would be salivating. The WSB community isn‚Äôt dumb!
 
Ladies and gentlemen:

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR PRICE TO GET HERE FOR A YEAR 

PRICE HAS TO REVISIT THE HIGH.

PRICE WILL REVISIT THE HIGH.

The question isn‚Äôt when, the question is how fast.

As much consolidation as I am seeing here at the absolute range lows without any breaking of the below support ($8.82) in over 1 year, means price will go higher quickly. 

There is a tiny gap at 16.27 that has to be closed. So that‚Äôs why I say once this goes up it will go üöÄüöÄüöÄquickly.

For reference sake, I saw the same thing I see now on WBD in Jan of 2023. Those options did 5 x in one week. Not to mention‚Ä¶ We have been range trading for over a year and a half. That‚Äôs bananas. 

This chart gives us parabolic potential on returns. This WILL go above $78 sooner than we think. The thing is if it gets there fast (WSB supports this) or we get there immediately. Either way. The charts don‚Äôt lie and I will be profiting all the way up on this one.

Footnote: Their Earnings Call is tomorrow at 8am. 

As explosive as this breakout will be to the upside, buying the cheapest options will be explosive with the profits. 

I anticipate it will hit 16.27 within the first 2 months (that‚Äôs 2x even though I really think the first 3 weeks for a 20x return, but I will be conservative). 

I purchased the following long calls:

-June 21 $30 @$.01 
      -If price jumps short term to 16.27, these options will be the first to cash out.

-Jan 2025 $30 @.06 
       -If we move a bit slower, my target is $30 for these options 

 -Jan 2026 $25 @$.39
        - I am buying these in case the WSB community sees what I see here and we shoot to push this to a new high.

I‚Äôm certain everyone has an options calculator so please DYOR. I am happy to answer any questions. 

I don‚Äôt have a cat meme, but this is definitely a Harry Potty meme. His wand was made of Holly Wood and made magic at the movies. So let‚Äôs make our own hit and get rich from the movies WITHOUT being a celebrity!

**On 'charts' on** [my sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dx-99aQ5xt8f1snN43ABznjEqYZ1oc_-NmcpYiFn7ig/edit?usp=sharing) **you can see the difference in 5 year debt, 10 year debt and lifetime debt.**

All values in the sheet are nominal. So $100 borrowed at 10% is $110.

**Overall nominal debt is actually up despite debt payments, however some of the additions in debt are drastically in the future. Hence the need for moddelling.**

TOTAL NOMINAL DEBT IN USD Q2 2023: 47.6B

TOTAL NOMINAL DEBT IN USD Q3 2023: 48B

**We currently have more cash and cash equivilants than we do in overall debt due in 2024.**

Cash and cash equivilants Q3 2023: $2.4B.

Debt due in 2023+2024: $1.8B

**18 months change in debt due. ($2.5b is due in Q1 2025 but expect this to change)**

Q2 2023 until Q4 2024 = 4B

Q3 2023 until Q1 2025 = $4.4B. (2.5b is due in Q1 2025).

**Only 3% of debt is now variable rate.**

The true strength of WBD is tested in Q4. It is their most important quarter. Last year Q3 was a weak quarter, and Q4 was phenominal.

**See below strong cash increase in Q4:**

*Q3 2022 = $2,422,000,000*

They say they are unprofitable but have positive FCF. I think that's only after a high Depreciation and amortisation (D&A) for tax purposes I'm guessing. After Discovery bought warner media they claimed it assets as depriciating assets which I think works to their advantage. So they can report no profit while making profits and pay less tax. But I want to check this here.

The following is from their [MRQ.](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/WBD-2023-06-30-10Q-Filed.pdf)

They have 1.9billion in D&A. So, revenue = 10billion. Cost & Expenses = 11Billion. 

This means profit = loss of -1billion.

But if you do Costs and Expenses - D&A = 9Billion.

This means profit = profit of +1billion in the MRQ.

Have I got this right? On Yahoo Finance and their 10-Q their FCF is positive and net cash flow is negative. Thats whats throwing me through loops. 

Also their cash is down 700m. I need to create some solid benchmarks to establish if I should hold or close and wander where to put them.

15h8s5y_WBD,WBD,"WBD narrows streaming loss thanks to 3x higher content licensing revenue ($410M). More ""co-exclusive"" deals coming.","The company‚Äôs DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year‚Äôs sales, after offering shows like ‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù to rivals

Revenue from licensing HBO content buoyed Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs streaming business in the second quarter, the company revealed in its earnings report Thursday. The sales helped significantly narrow its loss and appeared to be playing a big part in the company‚Äôs promise for its U.S. direct-t0-consumer business to turn a profit in 2023.

The media giant reported $2.73 billion in revenue in its DTC segment, which launched its Max service during the quarter. That was a 37% leap from last year‚Äôs second quarter, and represented about 26% of the company‚Äôs total revenue for the period. The segment swung to a $3 million EBITDA loss for the second quarter after reporting $50 million in positive EBITDA in the first quarter.

Content licensing revenue at $410 million revenue rose notably, more than tripling the $132 million reported in the same quarter last year, suggesting that the company would have had a far more significant loss without those fees.

The growth in licensing reflects a surprising move in recent months toward offering HBO shows like ‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù to free, ad-supported streaming TV services like Amazon‚Äôs Freevee and the Roku Channel. Warner Bros. Discovery also licensed HBO shows including ‚ÄúInsecure‚Äù to Netflix.

CEO David Zaslav said on a call with analysts Thursday that it would seek to do deals on a ‚Äúco-exclusive‚Äù basis, meaning the licensed shows would also be available to Max subscribers.

Distribution revenue of $2.19 billion made up the bulk of the division‚Äôs total, including traditional HBO subscriptions, Max and HBO Max subscriptions, and Amazon Prime Video Channels revenue. Advertising revenue jumped 26% to $121 million, also mainly driven by subscriber growth. Total DTC subscribers fell by 1.8 million in the quarter to 95.8 million.

Zaslav told analysts the company‚Äôs deep content library ‚Äúoffers a wealth of opportunity in terms of feeding our own platforms, as well as others.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mainstay of our business to create great content and window width, through creating value in each window,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd as you would expect a lot of analysis and strategic discussion goes into these decisions. In some cases, we‚Äôll want to keep premium content exclusively on our platform for a very long time. In other cases, we may sell it to third parties, and we don‚Äôt lose anything by growing the pie.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fact is licensing some library content to others VOD platforms like Netflix or Amazon as part of a co-exclusive agreement is just smart business,‚Äù Zaslav said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre expanding our audience, while maximizing the value of the asset and providing more revenue streams. And that is our job, to optimize the windowing to get the best possible return on investment.‚Äù

Warner Bros Discovery also inked deals with Roku and Tubi to license 2,000 hours of content and launch a series of channels in January. It also plans to introduce its own FAST service this year.

Later in the call, the CEO noted that if the Hollywood strikes continue, ‚Äúthere may be more demand‚Äù for WBD content.",2023-08-03,11,8

14qpbk2_WBD,WBD,Warner Bros Discovery - licencing to Netflix,"Can fellow investors tell me if this news is bullish or bearish please? 

It's being touted as a move to improve the financials of WBD - I assume it's a cash flow from Netflix as commission for hosting WBD's shows, so bullish short term, but also implies that cash flow might be an issue as WBD have their own streaming platforms so why licence shows to Netflix and not just keep them yourself? So long term bear?

Looks like cash took a significant downturn in Q1 23, mainly due to debt repayments and poorly managed working capital (receivables/ payables) - it would have been even worse had they not taken out $1.5bln in debt (of which they will pay more interest on, but was used to pay off some near term debt, so assume small net increase). WBD have also been in a net current liability position for 2023 & 2022.

Good to get some more opinions please! All seems quite bearish on cash now that I think about it :/

Mark your calendar. You‚Äôll have access to Max as soon as it arrives on May 23.‚Äù


My take :


One of Zeslavs (and bob iger) complain is how expensive content has become. And that there‚Äôs too much good stuff in these service.


I follow this a lot and worked in one of these big companies.

Imo at the end of the day these platforms will end up being and doing the ‚ÄúTV thing‚Äù of having a few prime time shows so people tune in‚Ä¶ in streaming well, you can see it taking form: Disney has mandalorian, hbomax has succession and paramount dives into Star Trek and other famous franchises to cut through the noise.


The issue now is how to get people to not expect hbo max to not have every single amazing title on the service and therefore be able to sell these licenses to other networks and streaming companies. Create scarcity to push up licensing prices but without pushing users to bittorrent.

Which is basically like taking away peoples beer at a bar during last call. 

The plan I‚Äôm seeing is putting some of the cheaper content from discovery (reality tv / docuseries etc) so there is more ‚Äúfiller‚Äù. 
And the good shows will be once again sold and resold to several other companies
Which makes good money. 

Anyways, WBD will probably hit a very sharp downturn and later rise as the plan pays off. 
And maybe they can pay some of that debt.

The other thing I‚Äôm predicting is wb selling off some big channel or IP to help w the debt. Maybe the cnn+ fiasco is a precursor. (There‚Äôs office/building moments as well). If that happens the that‚Äôll be a good catalyst.

Warner Bros. Discovery said it recorded about $11.1 billion in fourth quarter revenue, missing analysts‚Äô estimates, as the media industry contends with a soft advertising market. 

The company‚Äôs TV networks segment ‚Äì which includes cable-TV channels like TNT, TBS and Discovery ‚Äì decreased 6% to roughly $5.5 billion, as advertising revenue took a drop in particular.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported:

Revenue: $11.01 billion vs. $11.36 billion expected, according to estimates from Refinitiv

Loss per share: 86 cents per share

The company reported a quarter loss of $2.1 billion for the period, or 86 cents per share. It was not immediately clear whether that figure was comparable to analyst estimates from Refinitiv.

Warner Bros. Discovery executives began warning of a worsening advertising market last summer, and other media companies, including Paramount Global, have seen it weigh on their earnings.

The company, which owns streaming services HBO Max and Discovery+, said its global direct-to-consumer streaming subscriber base increased by 1.1 million to 96.1 million by the end of the quarter. 

Revenue for the streaming segment was up 6%, the company said Thursday, driven by an uptick in subscriber growth for its ad-supported tiers.

However, losses for its streaming segment improved, with a loss of $217 million, ‚Äúa $511 million year-over-year improvement in losses,‚Äù the company said. 

Warner Bros. Discovery reported continued softness in the advertising market, which has been weighing on its revenue since last summer, when executives first warned of a slowdown in ad spending. Last week, Paramount Global reported a decrease in quarterly revenue due to lower ad spending.

The company‚Äôs network TV segment was particularly affected as major sporting events including college football and the men‚Äôs World Cup took place on other networks during the fourth quarter.",2023-02-23,161,53

# Overview

Hogwarts Legacy's physical sales have already outpaced Elden Ring by 80% while digital sales are outpacing by 56% as of this morning ([source 1](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-stats-successful-launch/), [source 2](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-sales-numbers-so-far-figures-record/)). Assuming a blended 65% increase over Elden Ring's sales at an assumed $65/unit sold (many special editions have been purchased), **the game has generated a rough estimate of approximately $1.3B in the first two weeks of release**.

There are no known major issues with the game (some bugs present on Steam but no more than typical) and once it is clear the game is a hit among fans and the development is solid, the sales momentum should continue. Additionally, this momentum will likely see some benefit from the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch at later dates:

Overall, Hogwarts Legacy will probably generate at least $2B in revenue for WBD within the first year of its release. The massive success of this game will open the door for more opportunities to expand on the Harry Potter franchise potentially including DLC for the game and possibly, a [new movie](https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-cursed-child-movie-release-date-cast-story-will-it-happen/).

# FY23 Estimates

**WBD is currently trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV** with a forward FCF Yield of 5.7%. Estimated sales for WBD is $44.2B for 2023 (2% growth YoY, median of analyst estimates from Bloomberg, sourced from [https://app.tikr.com/](https://app.tikr.com/)) which surely includes Hogwarts Legacy sales but this estimate is probably a bit conservative based on very strong sales figures so far.

If WBD guides for an extra $500MM to $1B in sales for the year based on initial sales, this would imply a 3-4% increase in total sales (vs 2% estimate) which for a stagnant company like WBD, is a fairly big deal. Profit margins for new big name VGs can approach 50% or higher so with at least $2B in sales, at least a $1B increase in FCF seems realistic and would bring WBD's FCF Yield up to a favorable 7%.

# TL;DR - Focus on FY23 guidance, not past results!

* Hogwarts Legacy will generate at least $2B in sales in its first year
* WBD will likely increase revenue and earnings guidance for the year based on Hogwarts Legacy's strong sales so far
* Mgmt will want to further leverage the Harry Potter franchise given the massive success of the videogame with potential for DLC, another movie, or even a tv series (a la Disney)
* Markets are not yet pricing in the sizable revenue and FCF increase Hogwarts Legacy will contribute with WBD trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV

10zy3xp_WBD,WBD,WBD the sleeping giant waking up,"# WBD

WBD is a media entertainment giant that has had a rough last few years, but since the time I last posted the stock has reached a bottom and has started to climb up again, there are several reasons for this which I will explain on this post.

# 1- Warner success in 2022

As said earlier this has been a rough year for the stock price, the company has a severe debt problem which some believe they are not going to pull through, this has led Zaslav to cut back on projects that did not have great outlook and focus on the diamonds of this company (Wizarding world, Game of Thrones, DC : Joker(2019), Batman(2022)).

This has brought great success in the form of House of Dragon, Hogwarts Legacy, The DC movies and the experiment, The Last of Us which is the latest series that is raging everywhere. In terms of numbers most of this projects broke records, House of dragon premiere broke HBO¬¥s viewership raking up 10 million viewers, Hogwarts legacy is currently the best selling game on the major videogame selling platforms (Steam, Epic games) and The last of us has had the largest surge of viewers of any series from one week to another (22%) from 4.7 million viewers to 5.7 million.

This shows how Warner Brothers is still king of entertainment having the best quality, and it will only get better, since Zaslav has already said he would much rather have a bunch of high quality shows and franchises than to follow Disney, Netflix style of having a shit ton of shows that no one watches or are deemed lower quality. Furthermore, the success of Hogwarts legacy shows how fast wbd gaming is expanding into the broader gaming market to make place for future dlc and expansions, even thought its worth mentioning that Multiversus, a free multiplayer fighting game they released a few months back is basically dead in the water although having posted decent numbers on its release. This is also accompanied by their high revenue numbers on their cable business, the revenue will continue decreasing over the years but it is what Zaslav is using to pivot the company into new and classic ways in which warner studios and discovery can make money, be this the streaming services or the cinema releases.

In short, WBD¬¥s sucess in 2022 in terms of their Entertainment Business, shows how they are picking up pace, and with the incoming revenue from HBO MAX, their cable business and WBD gaming accompanied by the tax write offs on poor outlook projects and layoffs they should be able to get enough revenue to pay their debt

# 2- HBO MAX, Discovery+

As said earlier WBD is boasting great legacy content which keeps bringing people into their streaming services, The Wizarding world, Game of thrones, Adult Swim and all of the Discovery content keeps bringing people into the platform which are expected to grow as these new projects like The last of us get a fanbase.

The Elephant in the room in regards to HBO MAX and Discovery is how will they manage to merge into the new streaming service, this is currently unknown, but the name of the combined service is rumored to be Beam. In regards to Discovery+ , they are still unavailable in a number of regions which represents unexploited markets that sooner or later will be expanded to, this means more revenue towards subscriptions and larger audiences as a whole. The latest numbers concerning to subscribers in the platforms give 92.1 million in combination of both streaming services, they are projected to grow into the 150 million at some point in 2025.

# 3- Comparison with competitors

In terms of valuation analysis via ratios and sales comparison with the competition WBD is showing some great numbers, excluding their P/E ratio.

WBD

P/B : 0.71

P/S : 1.34

P/FCF : 21.55

Sales Q/Q : +211.8%

DIS

P/B : 2.05

P/S : 2.39

P/FCF : 2144.73

Sales Q/Q: +7.8%

NFLX

P/B : 7.44

P/S : 5.11

P/FCF : 99.74

Sales Q/Q: +1.90%

The only company that comes close to WBD in this comparison is PARA, which even though it looks undervalued via ratios, it does not come close in regards of the growth and production of content that WBD can achieve. It has to be said that if you don¬¥t like WBD for anything in particular, the undervalued stock you should see in this sector is PARA

# Debt

This is the main issue why WBD is so undervalued in terms of their share price, their current debt levels are sky high in a macro-economic environment that does not allow for an option to refinance into a lower interest rate payment. With a debt to equity ratio of 1.03 this means that WBD has more than 30 billion dollars in debt, it has to be said than more than in average the coupons they pay for the debt are of 4% annually and the principals are of a very long maturity, more than a decade or two in some cases, this gives a lot of time for Zaslav to develop his plan of restructuring the company into a massive growth cash cow. If the rates where higher and maturity shorter this would mean a really serious issue for the company, but there is plenty of time until the main component of the debt expires to solve this issue, and Zaslav has given it a high priority and is being reduced at a fast pace.

# Conclusion

Since the last time I posted the stock has been on a ride, surfing a harsh macroeconomic environment, getting in lows as below 9$ a share up to the point that all of its successes of the year, its growth outlook and its debt reduction have gotten it up 14.22$ a share, the current rally has helped, but this stock remains severely undervalued with price targets in the 20\`s range.

The next earnings release for WBD is coming in a week or two, I expect it to be a beat which would send the stock into a deeper rally and some nice gains in the way, on the other hand if the stock dumps on earnings I will probably continue buying more if it gets down to the 10$ dollar range in which it sat a few months ago, considering i DCA¬¥d from my first position at 14.37 deep into an average cost of 10.47 I have to admit I have a safe margin until the stock price starts hurting.

This is all I have to say about this Sleeping giant of a company, have a great weekend and good luck.

Therefore, price remains 'stuck' between these 2x major resistance and suport levels: 410 and 398 respectively.  The facts that it 'gapped out' of the bear channel, and both QQQ+IWM have reached major pivot high support, leads me to think price will hit 410 before the Fed on Wednesday.  But the way it gave up in the final hour of trading on Friday...maybe just people taking profits into the weekend, or maybe indicating it will not reach that pivot high.

**QQQ:**  This week I'd say tech finally 'caught up' to IWM from a techincal perspective, considering it both 1) broke out of the bear channel (which IWM did a couple weeks ago) and 2) reached the last pivot high (which IWM did at the same time this week as well).  That said & of note, IWM has pulled back to re-test its bear channel ceiling (now a major support level), whereas the QQQ has not, so this is the nearest major support around 284.  Price is currently into a major resistance level, but if it can get through then next resistance is just over 311 which is the next pivot high and also a pretty big gap fill between September 12-13.

**IWM:**  Great price action from a technical perspective.  After officially breaking out of the bear channel, price went back to what turned into a major support level (as a result of the breakout), and then rallied to the next major resistance level -- which we hammered on the last 2x days.  The next major resistance level is around 196, which is a very long term ascending channel ceiling the pre-dates all the madness we've seen since COVID stimulus.  The nearest major support level remains around 181, the bear channel ceiling and now also the 200 DMA as well as the TL which lead to the failed bear flag pattern.

10o7iw9_WBD,WBD,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // LVS UNG PFG AXP WBD K KHC,"**OVERALL:**  QQQ has 'caught up to' IWM, while SPY is now the infex lagging behind.  Markets will likely be quiet heading into Wednesday afternoon's Fed decision, which most analysts believe will be a 0.25 hike.  I have to maintain a neutral-to-positive bias considering how 2 out of 3 indexes re-tested their beear channel ceilings and those levels held, but I would not be surprised to see price move back into the bear channel in the weeks following the Fed meeting.

I've been very supportive of the moves Zaslav has made, but if this rumour is true, it puts his streamlining of properties and focus on brand improvement in very different lights.

This move would make a certain amount of sense as well, given how Universal was already looking to acquire Fox back in 2016 when bidding against Disney. Different companies and situations, but clearly Universal Comcast have enough capital to finance such a deal and it would further consolidate the entertainment and streaming sectors into few key companies.

There's a lot more in this article that I've not gone into, but this to me is by far the biggest (potential) revelation here.

So what do investors think? I haven't seen any discussion on this, and I don't know whether a sale to Universal (with anti-trust issues aside) would be beneficial for the share price as it currently stands.",2022-09-23,7,10

I own a few of these in my own portfolio, but I am looking into other opportunities to see what else is out there. Obviously, some of these will fall out of my circle of competence and therefore will not be added to the portfolio.

**Daily Journal Corp**

* **Business Model**
   * The Newspaper Publication - This newspaper focuses on legal news and documentation, but has been slowly dwindling down since 2008. They sell advertisement spots on their newspaper. [Publication Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/KDNMz7s)
   * Investment Portfolio - This is not the full portfolio because they own some foreign companies like BYD that do not show up here and the management does not typically disclose foreign investments if they don‚Äôt need to. Munger currently runs the portfolio, but they will need to pick someone else when he leaves. [13F Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/I7wLiPF)
   * Journal Technologies - This is a court case management SAAS company that has a lot of off-balance sheet financialS due to the way its business model is structured. [Journal Technologies Products Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/C9DmcM6)
* **Explain the Developments and Risks**
   * The investment portfolio creates a floor in the valuation because at a certain point you are essentially just investing in the stock portfolio while getting the journal technologies and publication business for ‚Äúfree.‚Äù Now obviously, it isn‚Äôt that simple because you need to understand the investments, but I like their portfolio and am interested to see who runs it in the future. 
   * Journal Technologies has a lot of sales that have gone through the RFP process, but have not made it onto the revenue category because they wait to bill until the system is completely online. This will ramp up a system that is going to be very hard and costly to switch off of, but will allow courts to interface with each other much better. They do not have a one-model solution which can cause some issues, but they tailor the software to the needs of the courts. Also, the software is used internationally as well as all over the United States.
   * A risk I currently see is that the management is very old and there have been complaints about the work culture by many employees who think there needs to be a change in direction work culture-wise. This can tank companies and I am working to understand the issues more currently.
   * Journal Technologies may not see some revenue from its initial RFP process until 5 - 7 years later depending on the bureaucracy it has to handle which could mean a delay in sales. This can act as a moat once Journal Tech makes it through the whole process because many companies do not want to stick that out.
   * Their big competitor currently and who holds the largest market share is Tyler Technologies according to Charlie Munger.
* **Valuation Metrics**
   * Average ROIC is bouncing between 3% - 5% over the last 10 years
   * PE - [PE Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/WEJuoA8)

   * I have been watching a lot of research from Guy Spier and Matthew Peterson on this because I think there is tremendous opportunity here. I just need to understand the Journal Technology side of the business.

**Micron**

   * They sell memory and other semi-products.

   * The memory industry is very cyclical and has had significant downturns which is why Micron looks cheap now, but it may really be selling for a higher earnings multiple after we see the next few quarters playout.

**Warner Bros. Discovery**

* **Business Model** 

[Model Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/AswoCl5)

Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (‚ÄúWarner Bros. Discovery‚Äù, ‚ÄúWBD‚Äù, the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates and distributes the world‚Äôs most differentiated and complete portfolio of content and brands across television, film and streaming. Available in more than 220 countries and territories and 50 languages, Warner Bros. Discovery inspires, informs and entertains audiences worldwide through its iconic brands and products including: Discovery Channel, discovery+, CNN, DC, Eurosport, HBO, HBO Max, HGTV, Food Network, OWN, Investigation Discovery, TLC, Magnolia Network, TNT, TBS, truTV, Travel Channel, MotorTrend, Animal Planet, Science Channel, Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Games, New Line Cinema, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, Discovery en Espa√±ol, Hogar de HGTV and others.  

* **Explain the Developments and Risks**
   * The company recently closed the merger of Discovery and Warner Bros. in April which is why there is a lot of consolidation in the financials. In the screenshots below, WBD is laying out their expectations for the future. The biggest development will be paying down their debt while driving top line sales to the bottom line earnings and free cash flow. I believe that their assumption may be more of a base case scenario with chances that it may be a tiny bit lower than their are projecting. I like their estimated EDBITDA to FCF conversion rate and hope to see them continuing to pay down debt. The management said that they are okay with around a 3x debt to EBITDA ratio while they are currently at around 5x their EBITDA. [Key Streaming Financial Metrics & Assumptions Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/40xktK0) [EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/aPJNVJN)
* Another big development that will come with this merger is the ability for the company to consolidate costs so there is long term savings. Since both are media companies there has been a lot of overlap on their financials and business processes. [Cost Synergy Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/HMYo1P1)
* The major risk to this investment is that there is a lot of debt on the balance sheet. While their goal is to pay most of it down, it will come down to how well the business generates cash in the coming years. ‚ÄúAT&T is paying Warner Bros. Discovery $1.2 billion this month as part of the separation agreement, and by the end of the month it will have paid down $6 billion worth of its debt since the April transaction.‚Äù ([link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/20/heres-why-warner-bros-discovery-is-a-buy/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8ecfa450-239c-4b49-82e5-b3c58a99c390)) [Debt Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/ZdN135Z)
* **Valuation Metrics**
   * The average ROIC is N/A because this company just merged and any historical data would just be for Discovery pre-merger.
   * EV/EBITDA: 8.13
* **Am I buying or researching**
   * I have been buying shares of this company slowly as I see their financial statements roll out with more clarity on the business I may add some more or sell some puts.

**Corsair**

* **Business Model**

[Model Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/xSNCO2m)

Corsair Gaming, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, ‚ÄúCorsair‚Äù the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù), is a global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers, streamers and content creators, many of which build their own PCs using our components. Corsair is organized into two reportable segments: 

Gamer and creator peripherals. Includes our high-performance gaming keyboards, mice, headsets, controllers, and our streaming gear, which includes capture cards, Stream Decks, USB microphones, our Facecam streaming camera, studio accessories and EpocCam software, as well as coaching and training services, among others. 

Gaming components and systems. Includes our high-performance power supply units, or PSUs, cooling solutions, computer cases, DRAM modules, as well as high-end prebuilt and custom-built gaming PCs, and gaming monitor, among others.

* **Explain the Developments and Risks**
   * With the new chips from both AMD and Intel making leaps in improvements, I think that there will be a refresh cycle as people move from older chips, chipsets, and motherboards to newer PC gear. Since many new computers will be built on the new chipsets there will be a greater surge of new DDR5 memory purchases along with other components in computers which Corsair has a good market share in. The continual increase in marketshare allows Corsair to sell their products at a premium while delivering some of the best PC components and peripherals on the market. [Market Share Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/e8XHt1k)
   * Another tailwind for the company and other adjacent companies is that the GPU prices have been coming down significantly due to many crypto miners selling their cards. You can see in the link [here ](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpu-pricing-index)that there are many GPUs even selling lower than their original MSRP brand new.
   * A big risk is whether or not Corsair can stabilize their costs and sales to stop incurring negative earning quarters. Since Corsair manufacturers a lot of product overseas they have been hit by the inflation in components, oversupply of inventory, and increased transportation costs. This has resulted in them taking losses over the last few quarters which means they will either need to take on debt or issue shares to continue operation. On a positive note, management proactively refinanced their debt knowing that they were in an exuberant point in time and took a lot of their outstanding cash to pay down a good portion of it.  [YTD Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/vJejeLB)
   * Another risk is that Eagletree owns almost half of this company‚Äôs outstanding shares. As of the time of this article Eagletree owns 59% which they are trying to sell down which we saw during the stock price run-up in Spring of 2021. The majority ownership poses obvious risks because of their voting rights and ability to possibly move management that will negatively impact the retail investor. There is currently no explicit plan for their selling and what/if there is specific target ownership they would like to get down to. Many believe this is why Wallstreet has not ‚Äúbought the dip,‚Äù but you will see that there is a reason it is currently selling for a cheaper value as well.
* **Valuation Metrics**
   * Average ROIC has been mid-single digits, but have been negative since they have had negative quarters.
   * PE - [PE Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/x3XmwAo)
   * Forward PE is around 14
   * EV/EBITDA = 60.10
* **Am I buying or researching**
   * I currently hold shares in this company and would add if we had some significant drops or the fundamental earnings start turning up for good. I am watching this position to make sure that they do not lever up the balance sheet too much. 

**Carriage Services**

* **Business Model**

[Business Model Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/t2l66ui)

Carriage Services, Inc. (‚ÄúCarriage,‚Äù the ‚ÄúCompany,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) is a leading provider of funeral and cemetery services and merchandise in the United States. Our operations are reported in two business segments: Funeral Home Operations, which currently account for approximately 70% of our revenue and Cemetery Operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our revenue. At June 30, 2022, we operated 167 funeral homes in 26 states and 31 cemeteries in 11 states. 

Our funeral home operations are principally service businesses that generate revenue from sales of burial and cremation services and related merchandise, such as caskets and urns. Funeral services include consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and memorial services and transportation services. We provide funeral services and products on both an ‚Äúatneed‚Äù (time of death) and ‚Äúpreneed‚Äù (planned prior to death) basis. 

Our cemetery operations generate revenue primarily through sales of cemetery interment rights (primarily grave sites, lawn crypts, mausoleum spaces and niches), related cemetery merchandise (such as memorial markers, outer burial containers and monuments) and services (interments, inurnments and installation of cemetery merchandise). We provide cemetery services and products on both an atneed and preneed basis. 

* **Explain the Developments and Risks**
   * One of the largest demographics are reaching the end of their lives. [Demographics Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/xuAYV4u)
   * Management has an owner mentality and does not repurchase shares if they are not below intrinsic value. ‚ÄúAfter we raised our Roughly Right Range of Intrinsic Value by $10 per share to $65 to $75 per share in our third-quarter earnings release dated October 27, 2021, we continued to aggressively buy our shares into the end of the year. Since our senior notes refinancing on May 13, 2021, we have repurchased a little over 2.9 million shares (16% of total outstanding) for about $142.5 million or $49.01 per share, $26 per share or 34.7% below the $75 per share midpoint of our increased Intrinsic Value Per Share Roughly Right Range of $70 to $80 per share. So long as Mr. Market Rodney Dangerfield continues to significantly undervalue the ownership and future prospects of our company, we will continue to prioritize share repurchases within the Capital Allocation Framework of High Return on Invested Capital uses of our increasing Free Cash Flow.‚Äù - [2021 Annual Letter](https://investors.carriageservices.com/static-files/eb24e401-c458-4098-bc1b-34ac534c6d2e)
   * A risk is that they have quite a bit of debt on their balance sheet, but it is not due until 2029 which gives them ample time to either pay it down or increase the fundamentals of the business. [Debt Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/uffwC69)
   * This company grows its sales and book value by acquiring other, smaller funeral homes which have allowed them to create a great portfolio of funeral homes that run in a decentralized business model. The management team at CSV does their due diligence and then makes an offer when they find a management team and opportunity that they like. An example can be seen [here ](https://investors.carriageservices.com/news-releases/news-release-details/carriage-services-announces-acquisition-funeraria-san-juan)of a new acquisition. This can be seen as a development and risk because it will work as long as they can keep up their good acquisition record, but more than likely at some point in the future one may fall through. I think creating this proven track record helps their long-term experience.

&#x200B;

Warner Bros Discovery is a media-entertainment giant that has hit rough times lately, debt is concerning and they have not been profitable as of their last earnings report, but the company has some interesting numbers as of lately that could show it being severely undervalued. ( All sources for the information on the DD will be provided at the end of the post).

# Streaming and Box Office

&#x200B;

This year has been great for WBD in this area, movies like The Batman or Elvis have crushed the Box office and have posted great profits for WBD. In the case of Batman the budget was of 200 million and box office 770.8 million and in regards to Elvis budget was 85 million and box office gave 281.4 million. Special mentions to Fantastics beasts budget: 200 million box office: 405.2 million.

In regards with the streaming services of HBO MAX and Discovery+, how will they manage to merge them successfully is still unknown but separately they have posted great numbers, they ended 2021 with 73.8 million users and as of their last earnings call that number has grown to 92.1 million subscribers after adjusting for 10 million AT&T mobility subscribers. This has been shown on their quarter over quarter sales of 220%. This growth is much faster than any of the other companies in the industry (NFLX: 8.60%, DIS: 23.3%, PARA: 18.5%. Source: Finviz).

On the negative side WBD has had to scrap projects that didn't have good outlook like catwoman. This happened because they have to be picky when deciding what should go through because of their debt levels and protect their new DC movies that started successfully with Joker(2019) and The Batman (2022).

# WBD Gaming

&#x200B;

WBD has had a great hit with its latest release Multi-Versus. The game has raked up over 20 million players as of August 22, this can represent a massive cash cow since it is a free to play game which might bring more and more people as it keeps getting popular. This can generate huge gains via merchandise and in game cosmetics.

The gaming division is also scheduled to release Hogwarts legacy on the 10th of February of 2023, this shows a growing outlook and if the games are successful WBD might expand onto the growing market of gaming with some of their most knowledgeable franchises. This division of WBD has overall grown 4% in revenue against the previous quarter with the release of Lego Star Wars-Skywalker Saga.

# WBD Networks

&#x200B;

This division for WBD has grown 1% on their last quarter, and advertising revenues 2%. This growth has been explained because of strong sports and audience ratings. This sector is expected to slow growing due to the rise of the internet and unless they manage to get those services in there in some profitable way this sector of WBD might have some trouble, Zaslav seems to have a plan for this according to some interviews .

# Debt

&#x200B;

The largest issue for WBD is their debt, WBD has pushed the lever up to concerning points. Their debt to equity ratio is 1.02, this means that they have more debt than equity which is concerning, specially when going into a macro environment with higher interest rates which means WBD is not going to be able to refinance. The positive side is that when looking at their debt schedule is that their average maturity is 14 years which shows there is time to pay off debt and the interest they have to pay for this debt is mostly under 6% and for their larger bonds is less than 5%.

Zaslav has urged how important it is to reduce their debt levels and they have managed to reduce some of this debt during the latest quarters.

Ratios and comparison with competitors.

When comparing with their main competitors WBD seems to be growing faster and their valuation is much more conservative than Disney or Netflix for example. WBD forward p/e is of 11.45 which is a good ratio, their P/B ratio is of 0.58 which means that if you take WBD and sell it by parts you are getting more than what you are getting by market cap. Their P/S ratio is better than any of their competitors with the exception of paramount and in regards of their price/free cashflow WBD\`s is much better than the rest of the giants of the industry. The company that seems to be comparably undervalued by ratios on the sector is Paramount($PARA)

# What are insiders doing?

Insiders have been consistently buying WBD which may hint at the company being undervalued, they have specially bought after the last dip after their earnings report. (Source: Open BB terminal, sub doesn't allow pictures)

# Conclusion

If WBD manages to get their debt under control, their streaming servicies continue to grow at the same pace and the WBD gaming section is a success I see this company going long past the target price of 24.74$ per share, specially because the management has added compensation if the stock goes to certain levels in the next few years. I already own WBD and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years

Considering that the 30 year old media show Reliable Sources drew huge viewership regularly and was one of the top ranked media news shows, will the cancellation of the show and the 56 year old's departure impact revenue and negatively reflect on the EPS forecasts? I think this is a big loss for WBD. I would venture to guess that loyal viewers will probably cancel their subscription in light of this sudden loss of this media giant from the media giant.

vhpyuu_WBD,WBD,META and WBD are the greatest value plays of the decade,"
Extremely undervalued. WBD especially will double easily from here. It is literally guaranteed money to buy either of these tickers. It‚Äôs impossible for these not to double in the next 5 years. There is a 99% probability these are the best investments on the market. 

Discovery‚Äôs content spans genres such as documentaries, history, exploration, nature, sports, health and kids. If you look at what HBO and Time Warner currently offer, it‚Äôs completely different from Discovery.  HBO and Time Warner own massive brands like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, DC and Friends. Mixed together, it creates a holistic multi faceted offering for an entire family. Last summer, Discovery+ even covered the Olympics on demand, which drove new subscribers. The merger will also include CNN+, which launched on March 29th. In such a competitive market, their moat is their content offering. Unlike Netflix, both parties within this merger own their content, which is a significant value add because it increases their margins. 

HBO ended 2021 with 76.8M subscribers, Discovery had 24M subs, Netflix had 221M (russia), Prime had 200M (jumping 50M in one year) and Disney had 138M. If we compare this to Netflix and Disney, alone, each company is lagging.. Especially HBO which is significantly lagging its competitors due to a lack of international growth and AT&T‚Äôs unfocused management.

But together, Discovery will give HBO the infrastructure and focus it needs to become an international industry leader. And both companies, together, will have the makings of a media giant which can easily reach 150-200M subscribers together, the likes of giants like Netflix and Disney. 

So far, Discovery+ has over 30k ratings in the Apple store with a near perfect score of 4.7/5 stars, suggesting that the roll out and delivery has been successful and positively received among their audience. On the flipside, HBO has over 45k ratings with an average score of 2.8/5, suggesting that there is room for improvement. Always buy the worst house in the best neighborhood.  HBO‚Äôs content is fantastic, but their delivery is suboptimal. HBO is a rough diamond that just needs a bit of polishing. This merger has the potential to improve their adoption rate, improve the user experience and lower churn.

With regards to Average Revenue Per User, the product is still very early in its roll out and we think this is where the opportunity lies because the ARPU with DTC is much higher than with their advertising revenue. If we were to assume 100M subscribers, which is approximately what they‚Äôll have post merger, Discovery would be bringing in approx $6.4B in revenue. 

With regards to margins, due to the rollout of Discovery+ and the merger, SG&A and marketing expenses have been higher. Over the long-term, these costs will evaporate. What‚Äôs encouraging is that they are still FCF positive, despite these higher costs.

u11dgi_WBD,WBD,WBD and T spinoff/merger cost basis,"So, personally, when calculating my cost basis (for personal reasons, not tax) I consider a spinoff as ""a removal from total cost basis of original company"". i.e since the spinoff was 0.24 shares per 1 share, my cost basis for T is reduced by the calculated cost basis of the new stock.

But, in this case, Interactive Brokers gave me stocks of Warner Bros Discovery (with a ticker symbol WBD) and priced it at the price of WBDWV. Excel cannot find WBDWV ticker symbol and WBD ticker symbol leads to WeBuild (and even half the articles in financial websites show WBD and the other half show WBDWV).  


The way I would calculate spinoffs in the past (e.g. OGN, ONL, KD etc) would be.   
I received X shares of new company, multiplied by IPO price, that's the cost basis of the new shares I received, and that amount is removed from Original Company. Since my original purchase, is now divided into two companies at X and Y percentages, so does my cost basis.   
Some people told me that's wrong, the new company is ""free"" and my cost basis on the original should not change, I disagree completely on that, but that's for my personal calculations, not for any tax purposes (I live in a country with no capital gains tax so it doesn't really matter).

I am sure I am not the only AT&T stockholder here.   Sorry for the copy n paste.  Important here to note that you will not receive fractional shares of $WBD and receive cash payout 10 days after the split for all fractional $WBD shares. 

If you own AT&T stock at the end of trading on Monday, April 4, you will receive two temporary stocks in addition to your AT&T ""T"" stock before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5. 

The first temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5, is under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol ""T WI."" If you sell ""T WI,"" you will be selling only AT&T common stock while retaining the right to receive shares of WBD common stock. 

The second temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5, is under the Nasdaq symbol ""WBDWV."" If you sell ""WBDWV"" you will be selling your right to receive shares of Warner Bros. Discovery common stock while retaining your shares of AT&T common stock. 

AT&T Shareholders may not have very long to decide because the recording date for the new Warner Bros. Discovery shares is at the close of business on Tuesday, April 5. If you do nothing, you will retain your AT&T ""T"" common stock and own Warner Bros. Discovery common stock once the merger is complete.  

After the merger is complete, the temporary stocks ""T WI"" and ""WBDWV"" will cease to exist, and AT&T's ""T"" stock price will adjust lower to reflect the loss of WarnerMedia.

Finally, WBD will not issue any fractional shares of its common stock. As a result, you would receive cash compensation for any fractional shares within 10 business days of the merger.",2022-04-04,44,72
