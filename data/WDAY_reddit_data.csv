# Tesla’s Market Cap Sinks Below $1 Trillion 

Tesla’s high-flying market cap just hit a speed bump. The EV giant’s stock plunged 8.4% on Tuesday, knocking its valuation back below $1 trillion for the first time in three months. The latest drop extends a brutal 16% skid over four straight losing sessions, erasing $186 billion in market value—a hit bigger than the GDP of some countries.

**Europe Is Driving Off Without Tesla**

Tesla’s European sales crashed 45% in January, even as the broader EV market surged 37%. That’s a nightmare scenario for a company that once owned the electric car conversation. Meanwhile, competitors like Volkswagen, Renault, and SAIC Motor are taking full advantage, grabbing market share in Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands—three of Tesla’s most important regions.

It’s not just competition slowing Tesla down. The Model Y is undergoing a refresh, meaning some buyers are hitting pause on purchases. And then there’s Elon Musk’s political baggage—his rumored backing of Germany’s far-right AfD party hasn’t exactly helped Tesla’s brand in Europe.

**Musk’s Political Distractions Are Spilling Into Tesla’s Stock**  
  
Beyond sales troubles, investors are increasingly worried about Musk’s extracurricular activities. His role in Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is causing a stir, with protesters swarming Tesla stores and charging stations over Musk’s influence on government job cuts. Critics argue he’s spending too much time in Washington and not enough time fixing Tesla’s growing list of problems.

**China’s Not Bailing Tesla Out Either:** Over in China, Tesla’s big upgrade to its self-driving system landed with a thud. Disappointed users say the company overpromised and underdelivered, while competitors like BYD and Xiaomi are offering better driver-assist tech at a fraction of the cost. That’s not the kind of differentiation Tesla needs in its second-largest market.

What’s Next for Tesla?With the stock down 25% in 2025, Tesla has now claimed the title of the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” stock—not exactly the trophy Wall Street expected. Between slumping sales, aggressive competition, and Musk’s political distractions, Tesla’s future isn’t as autopilot-friendly as investors once thought. The question now: Can Musk shift his focus back to the road before Tesla’s stock takes another wrong turn?

# Earnings Rundown From Lucid, Cava, Home Depot & Workday

**Lucid’s CEO Steps Down as EV Maker Tries to Recharge**

Lucid just swapped drivers. CEO Peter Rawlinson is stepping down, with COO Marc Winterhoff sliding into the interim role as the company hunts for a permanent replacement. The shake-up comes as Lucid looks to double production in 2025, hoping the new Gravity SUV can supercharge demand. The EV maker still isn’t profitable, but investors didn’t seem to mind—shares jumped 8.8% in after-hours trading. ($LCID)  
  
EPS: -$0.22, a smaller loss than the expected -$0.25  
Revenue: $234.5 million, cruising past estimates of $214 million

**Cava’s Growth Outlook Fails to Sizzle**

Cava just got served a reality check. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain’s 2025 sales forecast fell short of expectations, sending shares up 2.71% after hours. Same-store sales are expected to rise between 6% and 8%, but analysts were hoping for something juicier. Even a strong Q4, featuring a 21% same-store sales pop, wasn’t enough to ease concerns. With no more price hikes planned, Cava’s hoping new locations and menu additions can keep customers coming back. ($CAVA) 

EPS: In line with estimates  
Revenue: Matched forecasts

**Home Depot’s Sales Turn Positive, Stock Gets a Lift**

Home Depot finally broke its eight-quarter losing streak, sending shares up nearly 3% as comparable sales eked out a 0.8% gain. The home improvement giant credited shoppers spending more per trip, but big-ticket renovations are still gathering dust. Full-year guidance came in light, with management bracing for a slow housing market recovery. Still, investors saw enough to believe Home Depot is stabilizing after a rough couple of years. ($HD)

EPS: $3.02, a hair above the expected $3.01  
Revenue: $39.70 billion, edging past forecasts of $39.16 billion

**Workday Jumps as AI Hype Powers Earnings Beat**

AI is paying off for Workday, which saw its stock surge over 10% after crushing earnings expectations. Revenue climbed 15% year over year, with AI tools now a key part of nearly a third of customer expansions. The company also boosted its full-year margin outlook, giving investors confidence in its long-term profitability. As AI adoption ramps up in enterprise software, Workday is proving it has a seat at the table. ($WDAY)

EPS: $1.92, easily topping estimates of $1.78  
Revenue: $2.21 billion, beating forecasts of $2.18 billion

Full-year guidance came in light, with management bracing for a slow housing market recovery. Still, investors saw enough to believe Home Depot is stabilizing after a rough couple of years. ($HD)

EPS: $3.02, a hair above the expected $3.01  
Revenue: $39.70 billion, edging past forecasts of $39.16 billion

**Workday Jumps as AI Hype Powers Earnings Beat**

The company also boosted its full-year margin outlook, giving investors confidence in its long-term profitability. As AI adoption ramps up in enterprise software, Workday is proving it has a seat at the table. ($WDAY)

* **Solventum** surged 9.54% following its announcement to sell its purification and filtration business to Thermo Fisher Scientific for $4.1 billion. ($SOLV)

* **Eli Lilly** added 2.31% after launching lower-cost, higher-dose vials of its weight-loss drug Zepbound. ($LLY)

# What’s down 📉

* **Chegg** cratered 31.41% as AI continues to cut into its online learning platform’s business, leading to weak earnings and subscriber losses. ($CHGG)
* **Krispy Kreme** plunged 21.91% to a new record low after disappointing Q4 earnings and issuing weak full-year guidance. ($DNUT)

* **Tesla** slid 8.39% after dropping for a fourth consecutive day, pulling its market cap below $1 trillion. ($TSLA)

# Tesla’s Market Cap Sinks Below $1 Trillion 

Tesla’s high-flying market cap just hit a speed bump. The EV giant’s stock plunged 8.4% on Tuesday, knocking its valuation back below $1 trillion for the first time in three months. The latest drop extends a brutal 16% skid over four straight losing sessions, erasing $186 billion in market value—a hit bigger than the GDP of some countries.

**Europe Is Driving Off Without Tesla**

Tesla’s European sales crashed 45% in January, even as the broader EV market surged 37%. That’s a nightmare scenario for a company that once owned the electric car conversation. Meanwhile, competitors like Volkswagen, Renault, and SAIC Motor are taking full advantage, grabbing market share in Germany, the U.K., and the Netherlands—three of Tesla’s most important regions.

It’s not just competition slowing Tesla down. The Model Y is undergoing a refresh, meaning some buyers are hitting pause on purchases. And then there’s Elon Musk’s political baggage—his rumored backing of Germany’s far-right AfD party hasn’t exactly helped Tesla’s brand in Europe.

**Musk’s Political Distractions Are Spilling Into Tesla’s Stock**  
  
Beyond sales troubles, investors are increasingly worried about Musk’s extracurricular activities. His role in Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is causing a stir, with protesters swarming Tesla stores and charging stations over Musk’s influence on government job cuts. Critics argue he’s spending too much time in Washington and not enough time fixing Tesla’s growing list of problems.

**China’s Not Bailing Tesla Out Either:** Over in China, Tesla’s big upgrade to its self-driving system landed with a thud. Disappointed users say the company overpromised and underdelivered, while competitors like BYD and Xiaomi are offering better driver-assist tech at a fraction of the cost. That’s not the kind of differentiation Tesla needs in its second-largest market.

What’s Next for Tesla?With the stock down 25% in 2025, Tesla has now claimed the title of the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” stock—not exactly the trophy Wall Street expected. Between slumping sales, aggressive competition, and Musk’s political distractions, Tesla’s future isn’t as autopilot-friendly as investors once thought. The question now: Can Musk shift his focus back to the road before Tesla’s stock takes another wrong turn?

# Market Movements

* 💰 **PayPal Plans for Venmo to Hit $2 Billion in Revenue by 2027**: PayPal unveiled its strategy to make Venmo the ""go-to money movement app"" by increasing merchant adoption, boosting in-store payments, and keeping more funds within the platform. The company aims for Venmo’s revenue to more than double by 2027 as competition from Cash App, Zelle, and Apple Pay intensifies ($PYPL).
* 📉 **Chegg Sues Alphabet Over AI Overviews, Weighs Strategic Alternatives**: Chegg filed a lawsuit against Alphabet, alleging that Google's AI Overviews have drastically reduced its web traffic by keeping users within Google's ecosystem. The company reported a 49% drop in non-subscriber traffic in January, leading it to explore ""strategic alternatives"" for its business ($CHGG, $GOOGL).
* 🚨 **Trump Administration Plans Tougher Chip Controls on China**: The U.S. is pushing allies like Japan and the Netherlands to restrict maintenance on semiconductor equipment in China, tightening export controls on AI chips and possibly targeting firms like Nvidia.

# Earnings Rundown From Lucid, Cava, Home Depot & Workday

**Lucid’s CEO Steps Down as EV Maker Tries to Recharge**

Lucid just swapped drivers. CEO Peter Rawlinson is stepping down, with COO Marc Winterhoff sliding into the interim role as the company hunts for a permanent replacement. The shake-up comes as Lucid looks to double production in 2025, hoping the new Gravity SUV can supercharge demand. The EV maker still isn’t profitable, but investors didn’t seem to mind—shares jumped 8.8% in after-hours trading. ($LCID)  
  
EPS: -$0.22, a smaller loss than the expected -$0.25  
Revenue: $234.5 million, cruising past estimates of $214 million

**Cava’s Growth Outlook Fails to Sizzle**

Cava just got served a reality check. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain’s 2025 sales forecast fell short of expectations, sending shares up 2.71% after hours. Same-store sales are expected to rise between 6% and 8%, but analysts were hoping for something juicier. Even a strong Q4, featuring a 21% same-store sales pop, wasn’t enough to ease concerns. With no more price hikes planned, Cava’s hoping new locations and menu additions can keep customers coming back. ($CAVA) 

EPS: In line with estimates  
Revenue: Matched forecasts

**Home Depot’s Sales Turn Positive, Stock Gets a Lift**

Home Depot finally broke its eight-quarter losing streak, sending shares up nearly 3% as comparable sales eked out a 0.8% gain. The home improvement giant credited shoppers spending more per trip, but big-ticket renovations are still gathering dust. Full-year guidance came in light, with management bracing for a slow housing market recovery. Still, investors saw enough to believe Home Depot is stabilizing after a rough couple of years. ($HD)

The result, I exited the $240 calls for a 4x & covered both the $260 & $270 calls for near worthless to milk extra tendies. Also FYI: This play would've net $1200 if $WDAY was anything below $240 by close today as well, the $240 call was basically all paid for & covered with the premiums I netted from the OTM shorts.
