Moody’s Ratings on Monday downgraded the long-term ratings of several of America’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), citing weakened prospects of federal support following Friday’s U.S. sovereign downgrade. The move marks a rare blow to the top tier of the U.S. financial system and may raise borrowing costs and regulatory pressure on institutions still seen as systemically important.

The rating agency lowered deposit ratings, senior unsecured debt, and counterparty risk assessments for key subsidiaries and branches of the banks to Aa2 from Aa1. These ratings had previously included a notch of uplift tied to the government’s Aaa rating, support Moody’s no longer deems as fully credible following the downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt to Aa1.

“The downgrade of the US Government’s rating indicates that it has less ability to support the US’s global systemically important banks,” Moody’s said. “The ratings and assessments downgraded in today’s action all previously incorporated one notch of US Government support uplift and this notch of support has now been removed.”

(MS WFC C Société Générale),"I've been watching in disbelief as bank stocks have been on a tear lately. en Wells Fargo (WFC) has surged more than 45% since I sold my shares. y alone, Société Générale jumped by 10%. Wh's fueling this meteoric rise?

Loing at the past six months, several major banks have posted impressive gains:

* **Wells Fargo :** Over e past six months, WFC has seen a significant increase in its stock price, reflecting strong performance and investor confidence.
* **Morgan Chase :** JPM has so experienced a notable upward trend, with its stock appreciating considerably during the same period.
* **Citygroup :** Similarly, Citigroup's stock has climbed, showcasing robust growth over the last half-year.

European banks also experiencing a resurgence. By April 2024, STOXX 600 Banks index reached levels not seen since 2015, indicating a robust recovery in the sector.

Is this surge driven by improved earnings, favorable economic conditions, or something else? I'm eager to hear insights from the community on what's propelling bank stocks into orbit.

# JPMorgan Chase & Wells Fargo Earnings

JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) kicked off the earnings season with a surprise: net interest income (NII) rose 3%, beating expectations. The bank raised its full-year NII forecast to $92.5 billion, signaling resilience even as analysts predicted a rate-cut-driven decline. Investment banking also saw a 31% surge, well above the 16% expected.

But Jamie Dimon didn’t let the good news linger—he quickly shifted focus to the darker side, warning that geopolitics are “treacherous and getting worse.”

**Wells Fargo Joins the Earnings Party**  
Not to be outdone, Wells Fargo ($WFC) also posted stronger-than-expected results, buoyed by a 37% leap in investment-banking fees. While the bank’s net income slipped 11% due to higher deposit costs, it still beat analyst expectations, driving a 5% stock jump. CEO Charlie Scharf has been aggressively expanding the bank’s investment banking arm, and it seems to be paying off—at least for now.

**Credit Concerns Lurk:** Despite the strong quarter, JPMorgan’s credit-card unit raised some red flags. Loan losses hit $3.11 billion, mostly tied to consumer credit cards, as the bank braces for higher defaults. 

Dimon didn’t sugarcoat it: 2025 NII will likely come in lower, and deposit balances have started to shrink. Wells Fargo echoed similar concerns, noting that lower-income customers are feeling more financial pressure, which could weigh on future lending profits.

**Looking Ahead, Caution Reigns:** Both banks’ strong Q3 showings offered a glimmer of optimism, but there’s still plenty of caution in the air. Dimon’s warnings about geopolitical risks and fiscal challenges loom large, while Wells Fargo is preparing for continued pressure on net interest income. 

The takeaway? Banks are navigating the current environment well, but the road ahead may be bumpier than these earnings suggest.

# Tesla Shares Sink After Musk’s Robotaxi Unveiling Disappoints

Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi debut didn’t exactly electrify investors. At a highly anticipated event, Elon Musk showed off the Cybercab, a futuristic two-seater, and the Robovan, capable of transporting 20 passengers. But beyond the sleek designs, the presentation was light on the critical details—like how Tesla plans to leap from driver-assistance technology to full autonomy. 

As a result, Tesla's stock took a hit, sliding 8.8% and wiping out $67 billion in market value.

**All Hype, No Timelines**  
Musk dangled the prospect of a $30,000 Cybercab hitting production by 2026, but investors have heard lofty promises before. Remember when a million robotaxis were supposed to be on the road by 2020? 

Fast forward to today, and we still haven’t seen a single one. The event glossed over key details like regulatory hurdles, safety protocols, or whether Tesla would run its own fleet. Analysts were left wanting more, with many calling the reveal more sizzle than steak.

**Uber and Lyft Take a Victory Lap:** Tesla’s stumble became a win for competitors Uber and Lyft, whose stocks soared by about 10%. With no real timeline for fully autonomous cars from Tesla, ride-hailing companies seem to have dodged a bullet—at least for now. 

Investors looking for concrete steps toward a self-driving future were left scratching their heads, as Tesla’s track record of missing deadlines looms large.

**Bold Vision, Bigger Questions**  
Musk painted a utopian future of robotaxis erasing parking lots and traffic jams, but the path to get there is anything but clear. Investors are skeptical about Tesla’s ability to overcome regulatory roadblocks, liability issues, and technical challenges. With no functional demo or detailed roadmap, the robotaxi remains a concept rather than a reality. 

For now, Tesla’s bold vision of a driverless future is still more dream than execution.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Monday is a federal holiday, which means the bond market is taking the day off. The stock market? Still open, but don't expect any fireworks—most investors are clocking out for a long weekend, so no big earnings or economic reports are on deck.

This week is pretty much a snooze fest for economic data. Tuesday and Wednesday won’t move the needle much, but Thursday is where things get interesting with initial jobless claims, US retail sales, and the Home Builder Confidence Index. By Friday, we'll be diving into more housing numbers with housing starts and building permits.

But while the data’s on pause, earnings season is about to kick into high gear, so get ready for a flood of reports to shake things up.

# Earnings:

Tuesday and Wednesday won’t move the needle much, but Thursday is where things get interesting with initial jobless claims, US retail sales, and the Home Builder Confidence Index. By Friday, we'll be diving into more housing numbers with housing starts and building permits.

But while the data’s on pause, earnings season is about to kick into high gear, so get ready for a flood of reports to shake things up.

# JPMorgan Chase & Wells Fargo Earnings

JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) kicked off the earnings season with a surprise: net interest income (NII) rose 3%, beating expectations. The bank raised its full-year NII forecast to $92.5 billion, signaling resilience even as analysts predicted a rate-cut-driven decline. Investment banking also saw a 31% surge, well above the 16% expected.

But Jamie Dimon didn’t let the good news linger—he quickly shifted focus to the darker side, warning that geopolitics are “treacherous and getting worse.”

**Wells Fargo Joins the Earnings Party**  
Not to be outdone, Wells Fargo ($WFC) also posted stronger-than-expected results, buoyed by a 37% leap in investment-banking fees. While the bank’s net income slipped 11% due to higher deposit costs, it still beat analyst expectations, driving a 5% stock jump. CEO Charlie Scharf has been aggressively expanding the bank’s investment banking arm, and it seems to be paying off—at least for now.

**Credit Concerns Lurk:** Despite the strong quarter, JPMorgan’s credit-card unit raised some red flags. Loan losses hit $3.11 billion, mostly tied to consumer credit cards, as the bank braces for higher defaults. 

Dimon didn’t sugarcoat it: 2025 NII will likely come in lower, and deposit balances have started to shrink. Wells Fargo echoed similar concerns, noting that lower-income customers are feeling more financial pressure, which could weigh on future lending profits.

**Looking Ahead, Caution Reigns:** Both banks’ strong Q3 showings offered a glimmer of optimism, but there’s still plenty of caution in the air. Dimon’s warnings about geopolitical risks and fiscal challenges loom large, while Wells Fargo is preparing for continued pressure on net interest income. 

The takeaway? Banks are navigating the current environment well, but the road ahead may be bumpier than these earnings suggest.

# Tesla Shares Sink After Musk’s Robotaxi Unveiling Disappoints

Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi debut didn’t exactly electrify investors. At a highly anticipated event, Elon Musk showed off the Cybercab, a futuristic two-seater, and the Robovan, capable of transporting 20 passengers. But beyond the sleek designs, the presentation was light on the critical details—like how Tesla plans to leap from driver-assistance technology to full autonomy. 

As a result, Tesla's stock took a hit, sliding 8.8% and wiping out $67 billion in market value.

**All Hype, No Timelines**  
Musk dangled the prospect of a $30,000 Cybercab hitting production by 2026, but investors have heard lofty promises before. Remember when a million robotaxis were supposed to be on the road by 2020? 

Fast forward to today, and we still haven’t seen a single one. The event glossed over key details like regulatory hurdles, safety protocols, or whether Tesla would run its own fleet. Analysts were left wanting more, with many calling the reveal more sizzle than steak.

**Uber and Lyft Take a Victory Lap:** Tesla’s stumble became a win for competitors Uber and Lyft, whose stocks soared by about 10%. With no real timeline for fully autonomous cars from Tesla, ride-hailing companies seem to have dodged a bullet—at least for now. 

Investors looking for concrete steps toward a self-driving future were left scratching their heads, as Tesla’s track record of missing deadlines looms large.

**Bold Vision, Bigger Questions**  
Musk painted a utopian future of robotaxis erasing parking lots and traffic jams, but the path to get there is anything but clear. Investors are skeptical about Tesla’s ability to overcome regulatory roadblocks, liability issues, and technical challenges. With no functional demo or detailed roadmap, the robotaxi remains a concept rather than a reality. 

For now, Tesla’s bold vision of a driverless future is still more dream than execution.

Investors looking for concrete steps toward a self-driving future were left scratching their heads, as Tesla’s track record of missing deadlines looms large.

**Bold Vision, Bigger Questions**  
Musk painted a utopian future of robotaxis erasing parking lots and traffic jams, but the path to get there is anything but clear. Investors are skeptical about Tesla’s ability to overcome regulatory roadblocks, liability issues, and technical challenges. With no functional demo or detailed roadmap, the robotaxi remains a concept rather than a reality. 

For now, Tesla’s bold vision of a driverless future is still more dream than execution.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Monday is a federal holiday, which means the bond market is taking the day off. The stock market? Still open, but don't expect any fireworks—most investors are clocking out for a long weekend, so no big earnings or economic reports are on deck.

This week is pretty much a snooze fest for economic data. Tuesday and Wednesday won’t move the needle much, but Thursday is where things get interesting with initial jobless claims, US retail sales, and the Home Builder Confidence Index. By Friday, we'll be diving into more housing numbers with housing starts and building permits.

But while the data’s on pause, earnings season is about to kick into high gear, so get ready for a flood of reports to shake things up.

# Earnings:

1fyvb52_AMZN,AMZN,Wells Fargo downgrades Amazon on slowing growth expectations & Walmart competition,"Amazon Inc. shares fell on Monday, following a rare analyst downgrade that cited concerns over margin trends into next year, which growth in the cloud computing business is unlikely to compensate for.

Wells Fargo Securities cut the stock to equal weight from overweight, with analyst Ken Gawrelski becoming one of the few analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy recommendation on the stock. He also cut his price target from $225 to $183, one of the lowest on Wall Street.

1e1iyaw_NET,NET,Wells Fargo shares tumble after net interest income falls short of estimates ,"Wells Fargo on Friday reported a 9% decline in net interest income, even though its second-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations.

Here’s what the bank did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.33 versus $1.29 cents expected

Revenue: $20.69 billion versus $20.29 billion expected

The San Francisco-based lender recorded $11.92 billion in net interest income, a key measure of what a bank makes on lending, marking a 9% year-over-year decline. That was below the $12.12 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet. The bank said the drop was due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs.

Shares of Wells Fargo fell nearly 7% in Friday’s trading.

“We continued to see growth in our fee-based revenue offsetting an expected decline in net interest income,” CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement. “The investments we have been making allowed us to take advantage of the market activity in the quarter with strong performance in investment advisory, trading, and investment banking fees.”

Wells Fargo saw net income dip to $4.91 billion, or $1.33 per share, in the second quarter, from $4.94 billion, or $1.25 per share, during the same quarter a year ago. The bank set aside $1.24 billion as provision for credit losses, which included a modest decrease in the allowance for those losses. Revenue rose to $20.69 billion in the quarter.

The bank repurchased more than $12 billion of common stock during the first half of 2024 and it expects to increase the third-quarter dividend by 14%.

The stock is up more than 22% this year, outperforming the S&P 500.

1bem70j_WFC,WFC,$WFC Wells Fargo Rage YOLO and DD I guess.,"Everybody *hates* this bank, but we *love* money, right? So turn the volume down on your morals and let’s get rich.

I’ve been spinning the $WFC Wheel of Doom for a while now. I’ve made money and lost money, but my underlying thesis has not been realized. *Yet*. Let’s get the dirty business out of the way first, I’m in a a truckload of calls. I’ve been preaching this for a while, it’s in my post history, go check it out later.  Below is the workin’-man’s-YOLO-lotto-pick-DD for $WFC. *(If words like “thesis” scare you, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.)*

[My stash](https://preview.redd.it/z8aac90g5boc1.jpg?width=1287&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e9f9895a399884db00fac013ad1e2b4b2108e5)

# 

# Key Catalyst:

This is the shit that could be called “facts” in contrast to the brilliant pseudo-knowledge I’ll be spewing in the next section. There are three key catalysts for the current run up and also setting the stage for the “real” run still to come. In descending order of importance:

1. **Dec 2023 Federal Reserve Meeting:** On December 13th the Fed said “Christmas is coming, bitches.” and the market lost its collective mind. What does this mean? Somehow the Fed said .75 in cuts and the market heard 1.5, but that doesn’t matter as much as the underlying message that continues to prove true: *They killed inflation and a recession is unlikely.* The second point is what matters most for banks right now, a recession is *bad* for banks. No recession, lower rates, better environment for lending, all leads to fists full of cash for banks. Huge bump in $WFC price on that news like most of the market.
2. **Shares Outstanding:** What do you do when you’re in the dog house and everyone hates you? *Treat yo self.* Right about the time the Fed made the unprecedented move of telling one of the largest banks in the US it is in time out and has to sit at the kid table, $WFC said money “can” buy happiness and started buying back a metric shit ton of shares. [From the peak EoY 2013 to EoY 2023 they went from 5.27B outstanding to 3.64B.](https://companiesmarketcap.com/wells-fargo/shares-outstanding/) That kind of change matters and is a HUGE win for shareholders and will lead to higher highs. If only something good would happen…
3. **Earnings:** While they haven’t been perfect, they’ve been *really OKish* to good. The bank is making progress on their efficiency ratio, protecting against loan writeoffs, they have very little CRE, blah blah blah *big fucking yawn.* That’s not what this post is about. If you want to study their balance sheet and earning reports go ahead, *I’m proud of you.* But this post is about gambling a shitload of money on when the elephant in the room is going to start shitting gold bricks.
4. **OCC terminated key consent order:** The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency can fucking ruin your day. But they can also make you feel pretty. On Jan 30th 2024 they made $WFC a *beauty queen*, at least for a day, and $WFC went up more than 7% on the news [they finally lifted the 2016 consent order](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2024/nr-occ-2024-15.html) *“for deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices in the bank's risk management and oversight of the bank's sales practices, and unsafe or unsound sales practices by the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-11)”* This is the one that the Fed, in 2018, said you’re dragging your feet and slapped $WFC across the face with a fat asset cap. Now that it’s terminated, anyone with *half* a brain (most stock analysts) know that it’s only a matter of time until the Fed pats itself on the back and says “Job well done, Fed” and lifts that asset cap.

[This is a good thing](https://preview.redd.it/mjdsrswn5boc1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fca01c7ff24ab783684b2216454a1cc29b50b3be)

Did you notice there were 4 bullets? *But wait, this idiot said “three key catalyst” WTF?* Yeah, go back and read bullet 3 again. *Nothing* in a quarterly earnings report is going to come close to the move this makes when the Fed deletes the asset cap.

&#x200B;

# Reading the tea leaves:

Ok, I promised you a section of *un-provable* bull case bullshit, so buckle up. This is anecdotal information and unconfirmed rumor, you know, the *best* kind of due diligence.

1. $WFC stock price has been run up like a flag on a poll ever since the OCC lifted the consent order. For those of you that like **technical analysis**, draw your lines on the 1 month chart. $48 to $58 since Feb 15th. While you have the crayons out, check average volume too. This isn’t just retail/stupid money, these are large positions being built every morning for the last 20 trading days.
2. I hadn’t heard an **advertisement for $WFC** on any platform since the “apology” commercial back in 2018, which was very likely the single most [shit for brains campaign](https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-details/2018/Wells-Fargo-Launches-Re-Established-a-New-Brand-Campaign/default.aspx) ever in the history of everything. However, now I’ve been hearing non-stop $WFC commercials for personal savings accounts (DDA) and high net worth customers (wealth management). By accepting these types of deposits, they’ll be adding to their consolidated assets under management. *Crazy* if you still have an asset cap imposed by the Fed, or *crazy like a fox* if you know it will be going away before the end of the year.
3. Why the end of the year? It will **take a while to actually bring in cash this way**, and the calculation the Fed used to impose this limit is the following: “*the average of WFC’s total consolidated assets reported in line 5 of Schedule HC-K to the form FR Y-9C for the current calendar quarter and the immediate preceding calendar quarter to exceed the total consolidated assets reported as of December 31, 2017, in line 12 of Schedule HC to the form FR Y-9C.*” (That’s from the *Limits on Growth Section 5.(a)* in the Fed’s Order bitch slapping $WFC.  I’d link it, but it opens a PDF and that’s assault in 29 states.) That means they have *some* wiggle room to at least start taking DDA type deposits. Risky? Maybe. Bullshit? Likely. But *I am* hearing a shitload of commercials.
4. For about a year and a half I’ve been checking the external $WFC **Workday job postings** for any indication of what might be going on. There has definitely been a shift from risk and compliance type postings to wealth management, market analysis and management, account management, etc.. This is about as close as I come to reading tarot cards, but it *has* shifted.
5. Uh, even shitty investor DD sites are talking about it, if you’re into that kind of thing?  Why bother when all the best is in this sub?

&#x200B;

# The Buffett Case Against $WFC:

“*What about Warren Buffett selling his long held position in $WFC?*” – What do you mean? Do you really think the most successful investor in the history of the universe knows more than *me*? First of all, he sold at the *bottom*, so think about that for a minute. A few points to consider:

[This is a silly thing](https://preview.redd.it/49xmp0fp5boc1.jpg?width=1230&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=420fe25a34eb165108f88fc9a9be08c15e2400c2)

1. **Warren Buffett sold his entire stake in $WFC** because he has a “fundamental belief” that [bankers should be held to a very high moral standard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-why-still-holds-164425166.html). The fake account scandal demonstrated that the leadership at $WFC did not meet his very high bar of moral character. So he sold.
2. Buffett believed in this enough to [sell 271 million shares below $30 and another 52 million below $40.](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/wfc/transactions) That’s impressive **conviction to moral standards** and honestly should be applauded. It would be more impressive if he didn’t still make an absolute killing on $WFC, but he had to have known he was selling at a relatively *temporary* low.
3. **Charlie Munger still owned a shitload of $WFC.** [Munger has a different view](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-why-still-holds-164425166.html), like you and I he *likes money* and has a more realistic view of the moral character of CEOs.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR

1. “3 Rate cuts and no recession“ – The Fed
2. Shares outstanding went from 5.27 billion in 2013 to 3.64 billion in 2023
3. This DD is not about earnings or balance sheet management
4. **OCC terminated the 2016 shitty sales practice consent order which was the basis for the Fed’s 2018 asset cap**
5. Since OCC termination of CO, $WFC has gone from $48 to $58, this isn’t just retail buying
6. Lots of new $WFC advertising for demand deposit accounts (DDA) and wealth management
7. The timing for new deposits might point to the asset cap being removed by end of year, but probably not
8. $WFC job postings have noticeably transitioned from risk and compliance to wealth management
9. Popular investment websites are beginning to write about the bull case for $WFC
10. Warren Buffett sold $WFC because of personal beliefs about banker’s morals, so much so that he sold at the bottom
11. Charlie Munger likes money and does not give 2 shits about morals, neither do we
12. ""$WFC Wheel of Doom"" was a quote from u/Gooner-Squad gotta give credit where credit is due

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

https://preview.redd.it/71ypjsocddtb1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd16f07f8fa9b516525dbd24eca8bb8427b5f0dc

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

14zg9vl_WFC,WFC,"Expected moves, JP Morgan Citi, Wells Fargo, and a look ahead to Tesla","In what is the first important look at a sector of the market during the fresh earnings season, the big bank trio of JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi are all higher after reporting this morning. Blackrock is slightly lower. The other big name to report this morning, United Health is higher. As options traders, we're of course looking at more than direction. The magnitude of these moves is equally if not more important. As mentioned over the past week, we enter earnings season with some of the lowest IV we've seen in years, and expected moves for earnings the smallest we've seen in over a decade. JP Morgan options were pricing a 2.4% move, the stock is higher by 2.7% or so pre-market. Wells Fargo options were pricing about a 3% move, the stock is higher by about 3.1%. Citi options were pricing in about a 3% move and the stock is higher by about 1.6%. So options had the moves more or less correct on average, with JPM beating the expected move and Citi inside the move. As a rule of thumb about 70% of the time stocks should be at or inside the expected move on earnings. And of course, that stat is marked to the end of the day for stocks that report before the bell so the jury is still out on today. But it is something to keep a mental note of, whether we begin to see moves beyond the expected move or if options have it right, even at this low level of vol. As it could inform trade decisions, including holding positions into earnings as the vol collapse is quite different than it normally is.

Additionally, and especially as we start to hear from some tech stocks that have had a really good couple of months, are the moves to the upside the ones we see stocks beat, and are moves to the downside safer because there's an underlying bid in large parts of the market? Something to keep an eye on.

## Earnings Season in High Vol

This week marks the beginning of earnings season, with a lot of eyes on the large banks that report towards the end of the week. Earnings season in a high vol environment means that options need to price both the earnings event itself but also the potential for large market moves into and out of the event.

That means trading the event itself needs to be fairly precise, with strategies placed just before and taken off just after in order to isolate the event itself. Here’s an example, with Wells Fargo (WFC) options pricing in a 5.2% expected move for the week ([Options AI free tool link](https://tools.optionsai.com/companies/WFC)).

To put that into some very recent perspective. WFC closed last week up nearly 4% and at one point during the week was higher by nearly 8%. The other banks reporting this week are also pricing around 5% moves, more on that below:

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 1.5% in a wildly volatile week. Stocks saw a large two-day relief rally to begin the week as treasury yields declined, and hopes rose that the Fed was beginning to see evidence that would allow them to slow their aggressive rate hikes. Those hopes were dashed on Friday as the NFP report came in hot. Those numbers are notoriously backward-looking and even if it was the last hot payrolls report, markets seem to decide, that the Fed has cover for continued aggressive rate hikes for the foreseeable future.

The move on the week was inside what options were pricing but the swings in either direction during the week were way outside.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing about a 2.9% move for the upcoming week. The VIX ended last week around 31 and implied vol remains near its highs of the year.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.9%** (+/- $11)

## Earnings Season in High Vol

This week marks the beginning of earnings season, with a lot of eyes on the large banks that report towards the end of the week. Earnings season in a high vol environment means that options need to price both the earnings event itself but also the potential for large market moves into and out of the event.

That means trading the event itself needs to be fairly precise, with strategies placed just before and taken off just after in order to isolate the event itself. Here’s an example, with Wells Fargo (WFC) options pricing in a 5.2% expected move for the week ([Options AI free tool link](https://tools.optionsai.com/companies/WFC)).

Do you think the Fed should hike the rate that high?","It’s a move that would likely cause panic on Wall Street.

But Wells Fargo Securities’ Michael Schumacher suggests the Federal Reserve is raising rates too slowly, telling CNBC’s “Fast Money” he would seriously consider a 150 basis point hike this week if he were Chair Jerome Powell.

“The Fed knows what the destination is. So it’s got the funds rate now, the upper bound, is 2.5%. Very likely it gets to 4%-plus this year,” the firm’s head of macro strategy said on Tuesday. “Why not just rip off the Band-Aid. Let’s get there in one day. But of course, the Fed won’t do that.”

He acknowledges it would be a tough maneuver to pull off without violently shaking markets. The key is policymakers need to convince investors the historical jump in rates is frontloaded, according to Schumacher.

“It would do a huge move and then stop or stop pretty soon. The big fear in the market would be ‘oh my goodness, they’ve done a record-sized move. What’s going to happen next month or the month after that? We’ve better get out of the way,’” said Schumacher. “It would require incredibly good communication and confidence or the result: Carnage. And nobody wants that.”

### In the News

After the close Friday news broke that Elon Musk is trying to back out of his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR). This was not a huge surprise to the markets as TWTR was already trading -35%+ to its announced deal price. The stock was down an additional 5% after hours Friday. Tesla (TSLA) stock was higher last week, and was up after hours Friday on the news. The stock had not performed well since Musk’s TWTR takeover was announced and investors in TSLA seem happier without the distraction. Tesla stock was near $770 after hours on Friday, up from $680 the week before. From last week:

>TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

TSLA already made the move options were pricing for all of July before the calendar hit the 9th of July. It’s now pricing about an 11% move for the rest of the month.

The Musk / Twitter news may have been portrayed as a surprise over the weekend in the media, but clearly markets weren’t pricing a big chance of it happening. TWTR options were pricing a bullish consensus of about $46 in the stock out to December, well below the announced takeover price. The bearish consensus in December is about $25:

tyeunc_WFC,WFC,"Anyone monitoring financials as they've pulled back, as a higher interest rates play? C, JPM, WFC, TD, BLK....","I've always preferred to stay best of breed in this sector (JPM), but WFC was too tempting in the 20s.  I've since exited that position, but we're now seeing much of the overall sector pull back.

Citi's dividend is now well over 4%.  Morningstar is touting it strongly, with a $78 target.

> Bulls Say

> Citigroup is in the middle of a strategic repositioning, making major moves such as selling off its consumer business in Mexico and reinvesting in its strong points: investment and corporate banking and wealth. Citigroup may finally emerge as a structurally improved franchise.

> Citigroup remains uniquely exposed to card loan growth and global transaction and trade volume. As card loans eventually rebound and the global economy recovers, this should drive revenue growth for the bank.

> The shares trade at less than tangible book value, not a hard hurdle to clear.

q7xky7_WFC,WFC,Wells Fargo earnings top estimates as it releases $1.7 billion from loan loss reserves,"Wells Fargo & Co. Inc. WFC, -1.29% said Thursday it had net income of $5.122 billion, or $1.17 a share, in the third quarter, up from $3.216 billion, or 70 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell to $18.834 billion from $19.316 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.00 and revenue of $18.273 billion. The bank said it released $1.7 billion from its credit loss reserve, equal to a 30 cents bump in EPS. It also booked a charge of $250 million, or 5 cents a share, for an enforcement action taken by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency relating to unsound practices in home lending. The bank said average loans fell to $854.0 million from $931.7 million a year ago. Average deposits rose to $1.451 billion from $1.399 billion. ""Charge-offs were low, net interest income stabilized and period-end loans grew for the first time since first quarter 2020,"" Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said in a statement. Net interest income fell to $8.909 billion from $9.379 billion a year ago, due to lower loan balances. Noninterest income edged down to $9.925 billion from $9.937 billion, as improved results in private equity and venture capital and higher card, deposit-related and investment banking fees were offset by lower mortgage-banking revenue, lower gains on the sale of securities and lower markets revenue. In the bank's retail operations, home lending fell to $2.012 billion from $2.527 billion. ""The decline in mortgage banking income was primarily due to lower gain on sale margins and lower originations, as well as a decline in servicing fees, partially offset by higher gains from the re-securitization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year,"" the bank said. Shares were up 0.5% premarket and have gained 53% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.30% has gained 16%.

Given that you’ve read my post on [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), or are well versed in theta gang strategies, there’s an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move relatively predictably post-earnings.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since four of the seven banks report on Thursday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Thursday, the ones who report Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **$XLF can be used to hedge your plays.** If you want to long or short and individual bank, but don’t want to blindly do so, you can hedge your position by making the opposite play on $XLF. The options on $XLF are very cheap, and the IV is low, allowing you to efficiently shield your capital in the event of a downturn. There’s also a chance you’ll be able to make a risk free arbitrage play as well given that the options are priced awkwardly, resulting in guaranteed profits. Somebody smarter than me would have to run the numbers though, just to be sure. 

&nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You’ll get IV crushed and the move won’t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you’re exposing yourself to.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since four of the seven banks report on Thursday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Thursday, the ones who report Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **$XLF can be used to hedge your plays.** If you want to long or short and individual bank, but don’t want to blindly do so, you can hedge your position by making the opposite play on $XLF. The options on $XLF are very cheap, and the IV is low, allowing you to efficiently shield your capital in the event of a downturn. There’s also a chance you’ll be able to make a risk free arbitrage play as well given that the options are priced awkwardly, resulting in guaranteed profits. Somebody smarter than me would have to run the numbers though, just to be sure. 

&nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You’ll get IV crushed and the move won’t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you’re exposing yourself to.

#Summary and Conclusion

Eight of the largest American banks report earnings this week. I’ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-10-11,12,0

q5cjhu_BAC,BAC,"Expected moves this week, SPY, BTC, ETH. Earnings from JPM, WFC, DPZ and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 0.6% last week, less than the 1.6% move options were pricing. The SPY had an intraweek low below $428 on Monday which was about the lower end of the Bearish Expected Move before bouncing to finish the week above $437.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$437** that corresponds to about a $6 move in either direction, with **$431** as a bearish expected move and **$444** as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 19, down from 21 the week before. It was as high as 24 on Monday and closed Friday near its lows for the week. The VIX is about in line with its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping with January futures just under 24. Options are pricing more volatility towards the end of the year than now.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

With implied volatility slightly lower, options are pricing smaller market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs, all slightly lower except the DIA which is about the same as last week:

* SPY **1.3%**
* QQQ **1.7%**
* IWM **1.9%**
* DIA **1.5%**

As an example of how the 1.3% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $431 and $443 to see Max Gain:

### In the News

Cryptocurrencies saw a sharp rally last week. BTC is about 9% shy of its all time highs. Options are pricing about a 6% expected move for this week. Here’s the expected moves through this Friday for BTC and ETH:

You may want to go with november calls if you go that route to give yourself some extra time or buffer.  If WFC dips the night before earnings (earnings are on Thursday morning), I will load up on even more friday calls right at close if the price is right.

Sure, WFC has some bad press, but this is the market where cash is king and I have a feeling WFC made buckets of it Q3.  Some analysts are starting to agree with me.

[https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1806960/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release?cid=CS-YAHOO-FT-tale\_of\_the\_tape|yseop\_template\_9-1806960](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1806960/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release?cid=CS-YAHOO-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_9-1806960)

I think people are starting to realize banks are where you want to be over the next year or so in the market due to market conditions (one of the reasons I am in SOFI as well).  

WFC is supremely undervalued compared to other banks if you look at PE and what not even considering their asset cap restrictions.

If earnings are good, which I believe they will be, I am anticipating a jump to at least $52.50 once people realize how much money they are making via efficiency and diversification and how undervalued this stock currently is due to bad press.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you had fun during my absence! Earnings season is picking back up again, with banks leading the charge. We’ve got nine of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. Given that you’ve read my post on [*collateral plays*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7c0wj/mitigating_risks_and_maximizing_returns_using/), or are well versed in theta gang strategies, there’s an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move relatively predictably post-earnings. Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfPzgjt0mLyhOJUYBEmk4Fd3IpTTyWtkfF12d5L0RBI/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week inside its expected move, up 0.5% vs the 0.7% options were pricing. However, markets moved lower Thursday before a rally to end the week. That move lower briefly took options implied volatility higher.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$431** as a *bearish consensus* and **$440** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was slightly higher on the week closing above 16. That was lower than the levels above 20 it saw Thursday morning.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22.5. Near-term options remain compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfPzgjt0mLyhOJUYBEmk4Fd3IpTTyWtkfF12d5L0RBI/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since 3 of the 9 banks report on Tuesday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Tuesday, the ones who report Thursday and Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You’ll get IV crushed and the move won’t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you’re exposing yourself to.

#Summary and Conclusion

*Nine* of the largest American banks report earnings this week. I’ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfPzgjt0mLyhOJUYBEmk4Fd3IpTTyWtkfF12d5L0RBI/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the links which can be found on my profile or in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-07-11,52,21

ohm5ag_WFC,WFC,"Opinions on bank puts, specifically Wells Fargo.","Hey everyone, so lately I’ve been starting to feel like banks are in a decline. There seems to be issues behind the scenes that the general public does not have all the information on. Wells Fargo last week just closed all personal lines of credit, and the reverse repo purchases have been insane. I’m not too sure how the reverse repos will affect the market, but what I do know is that it seems there is a liquidity problem, and it’s the opposite of what happened in ‘08. Instead of not having enough liquidity, now many parties have TOO much liquidity. I also am bearish on Wells bc the regulatory bodies have been scrambling passing new CBOE laws like every other day, and the old audit trail system is getting replaced with the CAT. Will be interesting to see how these stocks play out in the next few months.

At-the-money call options for late July are pretty cheap on most or all of these tickers.  I plan on buying some before close today and I think an 80-100% profit on them is almost certain by early July.

At first I was concerned about this, but, I haven't ran into issues.

To my knowledge the personal banking is relative new and growing. Recently they have entered into the investing world as well. I'm sure this will increase their onboarding.

They seem to have a good culture, the valuation is attractive considering the smaller size and growth, and they offer a dividend. Overall I like the company.

I think this could be a big win in a few years if they keep onboarding users. Ally is a ""cool new bank"" that is attractive to the younger generation. I understand doubling the user base will not happen over night but I can see consistent growth.

The San Francisco-based lender on Wednesday posted a profit of $4.74 billion for the first quarter, up from $653 million a year earlier. A year ago, Wells Fargo and other big banks set aside billions of dollars to prepare for a coronavirus recession, hammering their profits at the time.

Per-share earnings were $1.05, beating the 71 cents forecast in a FactSet poll of analysts.

All through the lens of expected moves. The expected move is not a prediction of exactly how a stock will react, but an actionable signal of how options traders are pricing the moves. That can be applied to not only analyzing risk, spotting opportunity, but more specifically strike selection, whether that be covered calls, iron condors, or directional spreads (or to tell you how crazy your OTM call might be).

**SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$406** as a *bearish consensus* and **$415** as a *bullish consensus*. A 1% expected move is down significantly from the 3% weekly expected moves from just a few months ago. Here’s this week’s expected move in SPY, highlighted on the chart:

From a trader’s perspective, hedges and outright directional positioning costs less than they have in more than a year. Actual moves in the market can quickly go beyond what options are pricing. Last week’s 2.7% move higher in the SPY is a prime example.

Short premium strategies, where an investor collects premium (income) from selling options, are also affected by lower volatility. It forces a choice between selling options that are closer to the current stock price (giving less room to be wrong) or continuing to sell further out the money options and receiving less premium (giving a lower risk / reward ratio).

On Friday I compared two short premium strategies, the covered call, and and Iron Condor. [You can read that comparison here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mnkpww/covered_calls_are_good_for_getting_called_away/) (reddit link) and see how the expected move plays a part in those types of trades.

Although the current levels of implied volatility are the lowest in more than a year, they are not historically low. The VIX was 12 before the Covid sell-of in early 2020, it has spent the last few months compressing from the 30’s to where it is now.

## In the News

**Alibaba (BABA)** and the Chinese government reached a settlement on anti-trust accusations, the news was released late in the day Friday. As of Friday’s close, BABA options were pricing in about a **3.5%** move for this week, and a nearly **8%** move for the next month. That 3.5% expected move for this week corresponds to about **$231** for a bullish consensus and roughly **$215** for bearish ([chart](https://14eaka193uhe3z4zmwffpyc4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-11.58.19-AM.png))

Thoughts? I have been investing in Wells Fargo since March 2020. I still think they have room to grow. From my estimate, they seem to have a relatively healthy balance sheet and are profitable. The major concerns have been with their previous scandals but hopefully, Wells has learned from their mistakes and like Munger says in the article, this was probably more of a failure of judgment rather than ill intent. Whether their asset-cap is removed by the end of the year, the consensus seems to be that it will be removed by 2022 or at least in the next few years.",2021-02-25,7,3

ldf4wu_WFC,WFC,Why I'm BANKING on Wells Fargo,"1st, not sorry for the bad pun. I'm a dad, and that's what I do.

Ok, so Wells Fargo (WFC) was hit hard by the pandemic and unlike most other banks, WFC has underperformed in recent years. Not only did the pandemic hit them hard but fed regulations due to their fake accounts scandal really limited growth. They were primarily focused on commercial lending. Their investment banking was just a very small percentage of their operations. So when the pandemic hit, it hit WFC really hard. 

So the reasons I like WFC:

1. As we come out of the pandemic, this focus on consumer lending should be an asset for WFC. 
2. Their new management has focused a lot on control measures so that there will not be another scandal.
3. They are expanding their investment arm.
4. They have lots of money in reserve for buybacks which could see the stock price climb.
5. Also, they were one of the few big banks that cut their dividends. I expect that to return so not only with the price climb, I'll see extra revenue from dividends. 
6. They are cutting expenses.

I got in when the price was around $28 a share. I think the stock could climb to prices pre-pandemic (40s/50s) and maybe even higher, this year or next. Their new CEO has proven good and brought necessary changes. But this could take a while.",2021-02-05,12,42

ims0nx_WFC,WFC,Berkshire Hathaway Slashes Stake in Troubled Lender Wells Fargo,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-slashes-stake-troubled-212431667.html

(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., once the biggest holder of Wells Fargo & Co. common stock, slashed its investment by more than 40% as the San Francisco-based lender copes with the aftermath of consumer-abuse scandals.

Berkshire sold more than 100 million shares, trimming its stake in Wells Fargo common stock to about 3.3%, according to a regulatory filing Friday. A Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment.

Berkshire, a long-time investor in the lender, has been trimming its bet in recent months, down to a stake valued at $3.4 billion based on Friday’s closing price. Wells Fargo is grappling with lingering fallout from its sales scandals plus the effects of the pandemic and related shutdowns across the U.S. That’s led to a share slump this year of more than 50%.",2020-09-05,418,71

*9:25 alarm blaring*

Buffet awakes from slumber, eyes pop open aggressively, “let’s make some tendies,” he says in a commanding voice. 
Buffet grabs his glasses and robinhood debit card from his nightstand, takes off his favorite  wallstreetbets pajamas and puts on his suite and tie; 
“I can smell the tendies already, alright warren let’s go to the office,” he says to himself in third person with a cheerful smile.

Buffet makes his way to his “office” for his daily morning shit. Trembling in excitement, buffet pulls out his cracked iPhone 6+ to check his stocks. 
“This is the easiest game I’ve ever played,” buffet exclaims as he opens up Robinhood.

The walls vibrate, “SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT,” buffet shouts from the shitter. He finishes his shit and runs out of the bathroom still trying to get his pants up. “I have to tell my team” buffet says to himself. 

*9:35*

The team is together around the office table waiting for buffets presence. Buffet BLASTS throw the doors, “SELL IT RIGHT NOW!!!” 

The team looked around at eachother questioning what’s going on. 

WE NEED TO SELL, my portfolio is down -10% and it can only get lower from here, the bears won.”

Buffet repeats in a sad solemn voice, “the bears won.” Buffet weeps.

“We couldn’t have another airlines incident,” buffet exclaims.

hkvq77_WFC,WFC,Wheel: WFC / PCG / ORCL,"Hi all. Fairly new to options here. I’m considering starting a wheel using one of the three stocks in the title. A few thoughts and questions I’d love to get feedback on:

WFC: I think WFC is really undervalued and would not mind at all owning the shares. One downside here is that I work in financial services (insurance) so I’m already disproportionately exposed to the industry (employment, company stock, etc.) There’s some uncertainty with the earnings release upcoming, especially since they’ll be announcing just how much they’ll be cutting their dividend. Is it stupid to write a put that expires after the earnings announcement?

PCG: They’re fresh out of bankruptcy and in my opinion have a lot of upside but very little downside. The stock price is very low, just under $10, which I know makes it a bit risky from traditional rules of thumb. However, I think they’ve done a ton to mitigate downside risk with the restructure.

ORCL: Love the company. It’s been trading sideways for a while now, and I think it’s likely it will continue to do so. Higher cost than the other two stocks, so technically more risk for selling the OTM put... but not too concerned about that.

Questions:
Should any of these be outright avoided for a reason I haven’t considered?

What’s the appropriate strike for the initial short put? I was thinking something with delta in the 20ish% range. Is that about right?

What expiry is best for the initial short put? I was thinking something like 1-3 weeks out.

Note: I’m only thinking of doing one contract to start. Just trying to get my feet wet / study the strategy. 100x any of these shares is a very small fraction of my portfolio, so while obviously not the goal, I could afford to lose it all. Not looking to “hit it big” or get rich on options... just trying to learn for fun.

Thanks for any and all advice!",2020-07-04,2,9

I am a relatively new investor and was looking to find the earnings reports from Wells Fargo and Bank of America for Q2 of 2020.

Other companies seemed to post their earnings on their earnings date. I'm just worried that there's something that I'm missing or do am I just supposed to wait a couple of days for the earnings report. But if that was the case why would they say their earnings date was Jun 14th?

I'm currently sitting at -42% on Wells Fargo (WFC). I don't feel too terrible about the position but I have been considering selling it and immediately buying back into FNCL instead. FNCL is just a broad base finance ETF if you're not familiar (top 5 holdings: JPM, BRKB, BAC, WFC, C).

As I see it, owning anything in the finance sector at this point in time is basically a long term bet in high level gov/fed policy migrating back to a more ""normal"" realm within the next 3-5 years. Switching this position from WFC to FNCL seems like it would help emphasize that aspect of the thesis and reduce risk associated with any WFC specific issues that may or may not arise in the future.  

I definitely wouldn't expect either position to see great growth over the next 3-5 years but I do want some exposure to the space for diversification purposes if nothing else.

# Description

Wells Fargo & Company is a financial services company, which offers banking, insurance, trust and investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, brokerage, and consumer and commercial finance. It has three operating segments: 

* Its Community Banking segment offers financial products and services for consumers and small businesses, including checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, and auto, student and small business lending. 
*Its Wholesale Banking segment provides financial solutions to businesses across the United States and globally. 
* Its Wealth and Investment Management segment provides a range of personalized wealth management, investment, and retirement products and services to clients across the United States-based businesses. 

Oh, and you may have forgotten that it got itself into a but of trouble with the regulators and changed in CEO in Oct. Lossing it's mantle as a scandal free beacon on Wall Street.

## Recent financials 

Looking at the topline, sales haven't really gone anywhere in years, though in the current interest rate environment, that's hardly a shock.

Earnings have recovered nicely, though that's a bad debts have returned to a more manageable level. And the dividend has bounced back nicely too!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $86bn | $84bn | $84bn | $86bn | $81bn|
|EPS | $4.12 | $4.10 | $3.89 | $2.82 | $2.21|
|DPS | $1.48 | $1.35 | $1.15 | $0.88 | $0.48|

But if we start looking at some of the ratios, tracking performance, it's not so pretty. Yes, returns on assets and equity have recovered, but they seem to have plateaued.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Return on assets | 1.31% | 1.45% | 1.51% | 1.41% | 1.25%|
|Return on equity | 12.6% | 13.4% | 13.9% | 13.0% | 11.9%|

And if we look at the first 9 months of 2016... revenues up 3%, EPS down 3%, RoA down 11%, RoE down 9%. And the preliminary full year figures didn't excite either.

## Competition / Regulation

There's a usual list of suspect when it comes to competition, and it's fair to say there are small regional banks that compete with them too. But I suspect the bigger issue / catalyst is regulation:

> Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. financial services industry has been subject to a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and has increased their regulatory compliance costs. 

And it's not just about Dodd-Frank (which Mr Trump POTUS hates) but there is Basel III forcing banks to have better capital buffers too.

That aside, the RoE of Wells Fargo is nice *nice* compared with the rest of the US industry. In fact firms like GS and MS have had terrible metrics (though you'd not know it looking at their stock prices)!

## Cash / Debt?

""Debt?"" isn't really the right question for banks... but what are the leverage ratios. Regulators expect them to have a 9.125% total capital ratio. i.e. to have no more loans out to clients that 11x the equity and permanent funding they've on their books. 

At Sept 2016 the equity/capital buffer was comfortably higher at 15.4% i.e. WFC is lending just 6.5 times it's capital base.

Nice... especially since they have better returns than their peers too.

## Wall Street says...

The professionals on Wall Street have a $57.98 for Wells Fargo & Co and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. Unsurprise, since that's were the stock is today.

# Valuation

Looking at the PE ratio, at 14x it's at the top of the mega-bank pack. Though frankly, there's not a lot of a spread.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/wfc/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|
WFC | $291,896M | 14x | 7% | 3% 
BAC | $247,094M | 14x | 9% | 2% 
C | $172,067M | 12x | 7% | 1% 
GS | $99,190M | 13x | 13% | 1% 
JPM | $323,940M | 14x | 6% | 2% 
MS | $86,356M | 13x | 12% | 2% 
USB | $93,499M | 16x | 5% | 2% 
RY.TO | C$147,344M | 14x | 5% | 3% 
TD.TO | C$128,711M | 13x | 8% | 3% 

Imagine, WFC has traded between 11 and 14x earnings the last 2 years. The highest anyone's got is 16x. So it feels like we are near the top on the valuation side.

# Dividends

Wells Fargo & Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.57 per share which compares to a forecast EPS of $4.19.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 10% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4%. That 4% boost is mainly as we've moved from 2016 forecasts to 2017.

It's pretty remarkable to see the stock doing so well, with 2016 actually a down year and 2017 forecast to be a 3% EPS boost. In fact, it's not until 2018 that there's any forecast material Trumpian benefit, with a 10% EPS boost forecast.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers the only think that stood out to me were talks of continued branch closures, headwinds, and expense ratios coming in at the high end. 

But the market's not cared. Tally ho Mr T. 

So, am I worried for Wells. Not really, but I ain't buying today. It feels like the whole banking industry, is being given the benefit of the doubt. And if there's one think we should have learnt by now, is not to trust these folks!

This is a very interesting report on the financing arm of the automotive industry. What compelled me to post this report is the concern I've heard multiple times from different sources about the increase in sub-prime lending and increasing risk of default and/or delinquency in the automotive sector, which is their explanation of the low P/E ratios and declining share prices for such stocks as Ford (F), Toyota (T), and General Motors (GM) despite the (seemingly) good news & earnings reports coming out.

Some interesting bits to take away:

* Page 18: As the housing bubble was popping (07-09), the average loan credit scores were reaching their peek, since then, they've declined steadily during the recovery. Credit scores of loans are now approximately what they were in 2007.

* Overall, Financing seems to be more popular as a method of paying for a car (pg. 29). People are willing to pay higher amounts per month than they were previously.

* Buy Here Pay Here (BHPH), where the local dealer themselves makes the loan to the customer, is becoming much less popular.

* Page 31 & 33: Captive Auto Loans (made by the auto manufacturer themselves to the buyer, such as Ford and Toyota) have similar delinquency rates as banks. Financing companies have by far the highest delinquency rates, but the rate has come down significantly from 3Q-2014 to 3Q-2015

* Pages 32 & 34: Maps of the united states with the 30 & 60-day delinquency rates by state. The worst area: the entire Southeast region. The best areas: Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and the mid-west.

-positive earnings surprises past 3Q

Based on this, WFC seems a far safer bet than BAC. But I know my analysis needs to include more factors. The cynic in me believes that the big banks will in their own self interest make money over the long term, but not sure how they will go about doing that with increased regulation, not exactly a booming economy right now.

The firm reported net income of $5.72 billion, or $1.03 per diluted common share, for the just-ended quarter, down from $5.73 billion, or $1.01 per share, for the second quarter 2014. EPS increased because of continuing share buybacks reducing the number of outstanding shares. Revenue was reported to be $21.32 billion, up from $21.07 billion in the second quarter of 2014.


""Loan growth did not directly correlate to profitability, however, as the net interest margin of the firm, used to gauge how profitably it loans out deposits of customers, was reported to be 2.97% in the latest reported quarter, down from 3.15% a year ago""

I am long in the stock, but the decrease in earnings is a warning for me, I was ready to add more if the earnings kept up.
