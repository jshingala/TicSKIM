1kxl2p6_WMT,WMT,Walmart’s 2025 challenge: why tariffs threaten the low-margin retail model,"Walmart’s razor-thin margins make it especially vulnerable to external shocks. With tariffs now back in focus, investors tracking $WMT on Tiger have good reason to worry. Gross margin averages just 24.7%, and management admits they can’t fully absorb higher costs from tariffs—meaning price hikes are almost inevitable if policy risk lingers.



Revenue has grown at 4.8% CAGR over six years, but EPS has dropped nearly 11% annually. This divergence is a red flag. While Walmart is pushing supplier deals, private labels, and efficiency gains, even small cost increases could hit earnings hard. On Tiger’s analytics dashboard, I’m closely watching gross margin trends and same-store sales for early signs of consumer pushback, plus how competitors respond.



From a value investing perspective, Walmart’s moat looks shakier when cost pressures rise and pricing power is tested. The key question: has the market truly priced in these margin compression risks, or is there more downside ahead if consumer response falters? Would love to hear how others are updating their WMT valuation given these structural headwinds.",2025-05-28,3,10

> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. 

> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.

> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected

- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected

> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.

> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.

> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less.

1kmk9qi_WMT,WMT,Walmart is going to miss earnings,"Heyy. So Walmart seems to be a good, investible company. I foresee revenue shrinkage here in the US and will talk about that in this post. So let's start with the basics.

So Walmart has only missed earnings estimates **five** **times** **since 2015**. Walmart tends to do well with revenue growth. This earnings tomorrow morning will be time number 6. 

Last earnings report, walmart lowered their guidance and **expected to lose money this quarter because of** ***Tariffs*****.** I am making this post not because of tariffs, but because of ***Deportations***. I will not be taking any stances in this post--just talking about the theoretical impact on their revenue.

  
So to start, let's get some basic demographics down. In the United States, around 18.9% of the US and are the second largest racial/ethnic group after nonhispanic whites. Below is a photo to show the ten states with the largest representation of hispanics. There are an estimated 62 million hispanics.

[California and Texas are the biggest two. Going all the way down to Arizona and New Mexico. ](https://preview.redd.it/nsxgzi47xr0f1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0038e0dd29896216fbaa52122b6d00bc72db63)

So now we need to look at Walmart's consumer data. Walmart estimates that about .14 of their customers are hispanic. Now, this [website](https://www.contimod.com/walmart-statistics/#:~:text=Walmart%20serves%20over%2037%20million,6.25%25%20from%202023%20to%202024\) has a bunch of other data on the consumer that you could look at if you want to, but these are the important numbers.

  
**The Impact on expedited deportations**

  
According to this [website](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation), illegal immigrants produce quite a significant chunk of the US economy. The immigrants usually pick agriculture or construction work and pay quite a bit to businesses and our governments without receiving benefits like a citizen would. I don't think I need to say, but if agriculture product is harder to get, that leads to slower supply lines, leading to higher demand, leading to higher prices to offset the cost, not to mention the inflation we've already been seeing. Simple supply and Demand.

  
**This part is speculation**

  
I live in a town with a large number of hispanic people here. Me hablo un poco español de colegio. This, just as a source, wouldn't suffice because anecdotal evidence is fallacious. That being said, let's do a thought experiment. Let's say our non english or little english-speaking amigos see that ICE are ramping up deportations, xenophobia is rising and the hispanics are experiencing more of that, etc etc. How do you think they are going to act? I think that if they fear deportation, are upset with xenophobia, and want to stay as ""safe"" from ICE as possible, they will stay with hispanic areas as much as possible. This will drive away revenue from previous places they were shopping at and create small business opportunities with their friends/family that do have legal status and can open shops. My speculation is that walmart did not account for a drop in hispanic customers when they lowered their guidance last quarter. So let's do some math.

  
Walmart has 8 billion shares in its company and netted 5.254 bill in income. With division, this comes to .65675 or .66 EPS. They lowered their guidance last quarter to .59 EPS for this quarter from tariffs affecting goods. Now, I think that some very educated people know their stuff and I will not argue with that number based on tariffs. I think that tariffs and inflation probably did have a big effect on walmart. However, I do want to show some speculative math here. Let's say that the .14 or 14% of their hispanic customers dropped to 10% this quarter which is a pretty big jump, that will have changed their income to 4.729Bill or 

**.591125 or .59 EPS**. Now I don't have many metrics I would need for better estimation such as average ticket, cost of goods, etc. but that EPS is not accounting for tariffs. 

  
**Positions**

I have two walmart 93$ Puts expiring on 5/23.

1kml9jl_WMT,WMT,Option Plays for Walmart Earnings and Beyond,"This week is a slower week for earnings reports, but we still have a very noteworthy one coming Thursday morning that you don’t want to miss. This report comes from Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States.

Being the largest retailer in the US, this report from Walmart will be an important indication of the overall health of the US economy, and the impacts the current situation is having on everyday Americans. It has been called the most important consumer earnings report of the season by Bill Peters from MarketWatch, and you don’t want to get caught sitting on the sidelines for this one.

First, for you bulls out there, we found a 110/120 Call Spread expiring in July.

https://preview.redd.it/1x5fp1fc9s0f1.png?width=3035&format=png&auto=webp&s=a68bf1da6a7ff768ac7a809244604c2fe56fda6d

Historically, the cost of this trade is slightly higher than average, but at .53c, it is still well within our ideal range.

https://preview.redd.it/m326e7ad9s0f1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a5f31e2bf8a4ccc0df415d85324c702080656c

The price of the underlying equity (WMT) has had a wild ride lately. It was hit hard as a result of the liberation day tariffs but based on new global economic data and news, WMT is set to continue to grow and increase in value.

https://preview.redd.it/d5qhr5te9s0f1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93e9113b2a9647b72257d676a00f67fcd4dfb55

The heatmap of this trade shows profitability, and we like this one a lot as we tend to do for call/put spreads, because it shows strong returns with minimal risk (premium only), and it monetizes immediately if the share price increases.

https://preview.redd.it/jir039bg9s0f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0ea97c3eff384bfb53dc64e2d21215d5dff0a8f

On the flip side, for you bears out there, we found an 85/75 Put Spread, also expiring in July.

https://preview.redd.it/zo2fjkfj9s0f1.png?width=3039&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fe931f9f55a3f7da5d5e5aead8ca6f93de6a071

The cost of this trade is about double its average, which is higher than we ideally like but based on the given returns and the fact that were keeping the risk limited to premium only, we still see strong value in this trade, assuming you believe the price will decrease.

https://preview.redd.it/7ky5j74l9s0f1.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=024c76877db196556a4bb59ced4222768427556e

The heatmap shows profitability, and again what we like most about this one is the negative is limited to premium only, and it monetizes immediately, allowing an investor to take profits when the please, rather than being forced to hold till expiration.

https://preview.redd.it/mg9jcu1n9s0f1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=d754e9ee30ea1fd83d55d47b51d21f9be91f4093

In conclusion, the upcoming Walmart earnings report is important and a big indicator of consumer health and spending, thus the strength of the overall US economy. Additionally, this is a great opportunity to make money, especially using the trades we found.

And as always, it’s better to be lucky than good, so good luck to you all.",2025-05-14,11,3
1jlh81d_TSLA,TSLA,"Walmart loses $22 billion in market cap, CEO says budget constrained American consumers are showing ""stressed behaviours"" and low confidence","Expecting similar results for Unilever, Coke, Pepsi, P&G, Target, Home Depot, Lowe's and other consumer discretionary companies

Edit: While a stock market fluctuations are normal of <5% is normal, I find it concerning that the CEO has come out and said that consumer confidence is low to the point it is impacting shopping behaviours at Walmart, a low price retailer that is usually insulated from economic downturns and see's revenue increases as middle class trade expensive options for budget.

If the CEO is making this statement I think he is preparing investors for a prolonged decrease in revenue, and if Walmart is not safe, no retailer with a large dependence on the US consumer is

""Walmart’s market cap dropped by $22 billion after news broke Tuesday that consumer confidence in the U.S. plummeted to a 12-year low. CEO Doug McMillon had just said last month he’d noticed “stressed” behavior from consumers who were more budget-constrained.""

1jjkqb3_AMZN,AMZN,How safe do you think WMT (Walmart) is as an investment long term? Is retail dying? Specifically the types of products Walmart sells,"I haven't done too deep research into retail, but I just know anecdotal that retail for myself and people I know is significantly diminishing. Amazon and other online retailers are the go to, and even when you go into a store you are likely comparing prices to online anyways and choosing which is cheaper, which usually is online.

  
That combined with Walmart carrying mainly cheap chinese products doesnt seem like they have great retention of buyers and diminishing revenue when those cheap chinese products are EVERYWHERE.

  
The thing that saves Walmart is definitely groceries and other daily services are products they carry which are convenient and well priced.

  
I obviously dont see Walmart going out of business or struggling any time soon in the short term, but I am thinking 10-20+ years from now will it still be the same powerhouse company?

  
Can you guys give some insight on their fundamentals and what your outlook is on Walmart in like 10+ years? It seems like their P/E ratio is pretty solid, I just cant help but think they will turn into a bed bath and beyond eventually. Maybe that will come well after I'm dead.",2025-03-25,25,139

# Walmart Shares Drop As Retailer Says Profit Growth Will Slow

Walmart just reminded investors that even retail giants have limits. The company’s profit forecast for the year came in lighter than expected, with earnings projected between $2.50 to $2.60 per share, missing Wall Street’s mark. While sales are still climbing, growth is cooling, with revenue expected to rise just 3% to 4% this year, down from last year’s 5% gain. 

The stock tumbled over 6% on the news, as investors recalibrated their expectations. And to add insult to injury, Amazon just surpassed Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, raking in $187.8 billion last quarter compared to Walmart’s $180.5 billion.

**Tariffs? Never Heard of Them.**  
  
Walmart’s CFO, John David Rainey, admitted that the company’s guidance doesn’t factor in tariffs, which is corporate speak for “we have no clue how this plays out.” The retailer imports tons of products from China and Mexico, meaning new trade policies could jack up costs. But Walmart has a game plan: squeeze suppliers, lean into private-label brands, and keep prices low enough to keep customers happy. Whether that’ll be enough to dodge the tariff fallout remains to be seen.

**Click. Buy. Repeat.**

E-commerce remains Walmart’s fastest-growing business, with U.S. online sales jumping 20% last quarter—its 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth. The company is going all-in on speed, with 30% of customers paying extra for express delivery and same-day fulfillment becoming the norm. Walmart is also betting big on digital ads and subscriptions to boost profits, proving that its playbook is looking more like Amazon’s every day. And with Amazon closing in on Walmart’s annual revenue lead, the competition is only getting fiercer.

**The Big Picture:** Walmart isn’t crashing—it’s just hitting the brakes after a pandemic-fueled surge. Higher-income shoppers are still picking Walmart over pricier alternatives, but slowing sales, economic uncertainty, and looming tariffs make 2025 a tougher road ahead. The stock drop shows investors were hoping for another home run, but Walmart plays the long game—and when the economy wobbles, history shows it tends to win. That said, with Amazon gaining ground and expanding its empire beyond retail, Walmart’s dominance is facing a challenge it can’t afford to ignore.

# Alibaba Posts Fastest Revenue Growth Since 2023

Alibaba is finally back in the spotlight for the right reasons. The Chinese tech giant posted its fastest revenue growth in over a year, with an 8% jump to $38.6 billion, fueled by a surging cloud business and resilient e-commerce sales. Investors are taking notice—Alibaba’s stock soared 8% in the U.S. and Hong Kong, adding $24 billion to its market value. And in a sign that Beijing is warming back up to the private sector, Jack Ma re-emerged at a meeting with President Xi Jinping, marking a symbolic shift for the once-beleaguered company.

**Cloud & AI: Alibaba’s New Power Play**

Alibaba’s Cloud Intelligence Group saw 13% growth, its best quarterly performance in two years, as AI-driven demand skyrocketed. CEO Eddie Wu is going all in on AI, saying Alibaba will spend more on AI infrastructure in the next three years than in the past decade. The company is betting on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as its “primary objective”—a bold call in a race dominated by OpenAI and Baidu. Wu is confident that AI will reshape Alibaba’s business model, but like its Western counterparts, it still hasn’t laid out exactly how that will translate into profits.

**E-Commerce Rebounds, But Challenges Remain**

Alibaba’s core Taobao and Tmall platforms grew 5.4%, while international e-commerce surged 32%, led by AliExpress and Trendyol. The company has successfully defended its turf from ByteDance’s Douyin and PDD Holdings’ Temu, but China’s consumer market remains fragile. Even with stimulus measures, consumer spending has been sluggish, and Alibaba still lags behind its pre-crackdown highs.

**A $100 Billion Comeback, But Not Out of the Woods Yet**

Alibaba has added $100 billion in market value this year, riding a mix of government goodwill, AI hype, and solid earnings. But challenges persist: China’s economic recovery is uneven, competition is heating up, and the company is still trying to regain its footing after years of regulatory pressure. For now, though, investors are cheering Alibaba’s best quarter in years, and with AI and cloud growth accelerating, its long-awaited rebound may finally be real.

Looking at the stocks outside of the context of when I bought them, MSFT is outperforming 103% vs 97% but this still begs the question of why is MSFT only outperforming by that little when MSFT is 🚀 and WMT is 💩right?

# Intel Snags $7.9B Grant to Expand U.S. Chipmaking

The Biden administration has finalized a $7.9 billion CHIPS Act grant for Intel, the largest award yet in the push to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The funding will back Intel’s factory projects in Arizona, Oregon, and New Mexico—but Ohio’s delayed plant isn’t in the mix just yet.

This deal is smaller than the $8.5 billion initially floated, partly because $3 billion is now earmarked for military-grade chip production. Intel also turned down $11 billion in loans offered through the program, a move that underscores its cautious financial strategy as it navigates a rough patch.

**Chips Down, but Not Out**

Intel’s struggles are no secret—falling revenue, delays in tech development, and fierce competition from TSMC and Samsung have left the company on shaky ground. CEO Pat Gelsinger has mapped out an aggressive $100 billion U.S. manufacturing expansion to reestablish Intel as a chip leader, but execution has been bumpy.

Ohio’s factory timeline has slipped into the next decade, while production at its Arizona site, originally slated for this year, is now penciled in for 2025. Despite these delays, the company has spent $30 billion so far on its U.S. buildout, banking on the CHIPS Act to sustain momentum.

**Racing Against the Clock**

With Trump’s team criticizing the CHIPS Act as wasteful, the Biden administration is racing to wrap up grant agreements before the presidential handoff in January. Intel’s funding offers a critical boost as the company juggles job cuts, strategic reviews, and an uphill battle to reclaim its tech edge.

The $7.9 billion is more than just a lifeline—it’s a vote of confidence in Intel’s role as America’s chipmaking champion. Whether it can deliver on that promise remains to be seen.

# Walmart Steps Back from DEI Efforts

Walmart is pulling back on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck. 

The company announced it will phase out “DEI” from its corporate vocabulary, reduce racial equity training, and reconsider funding for Pride events. Starbuck had threatened a boycott just before Black Friday unless the retail giant made changes.

**What’s changing:** Walmart will no longer use race and gender as factors in supplier contracts or collect demographic data for financing eligibility. It will also review LGBTQ-themed merchandise, particularly items aimed at children, following complaints. While the retailer says some changes were already in the works, critics see this as a response to Starbuck’s ultimatum.

**A Ripple Through Corporate America**

This isn’t just a Walmart story. The retail giant’s decision reflects a broader trend as companies like Boeing and Deere also scale back diversity efforts. Activists and legal challenges following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling have forced businesses to rethink DEI programs.

For Walmart, the stakes are high. Over half of its U.S. workforce is made up of people of color and women, and it’s invested billions in diverse suppliers. While some argue diversity fosters innovation and talent retention, others see it as a risk in today’s polarized landscape.

**The Big Question**

Will scaling back on DEI hurt Walmart’s workforce and customer base—or solidify its standing with conservative consumers? CEO Doug McMillon, once vocal about racial equity, now faces a tricky balancing act. The retailer plans to fund its Center for Racial Equity through 2025, but its pivot could impact its broader reputation.

For now, the markets approve—Walmart shares ticked up after the announcement was made. But whether this strategy is a retail win or a cultural misstep remains to be seen.

# Intel Snags $7.9B Grant to Expand U.S. Chipmaking

The Biden administration has finalized a $7.9 billion CHIPS Act grant for Intel, the largest award yet in the push to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The funding will back Intel’s factory projects in Arizona, Oregon, and New Mexico—but Ohio’s delayed plant isn’t in the mix just yet.

This deal is smaller than the $8.5 billion initially floated, partly because $3 billion is now earmarked for military-grade chip production. Intel also turned down $11 billion in loans offered through the program, a move that underscores its cautious financial strategy as it navigates a rough patch.

**Chips Down, but Not Out**

Intel’s struggles are no secret—falling revenue, delays in tech development, and fierce competition from TSMC and Samsung have left the company on shaky ground. CEO Pat Gelsinger has mapped out an aggressive $100 billion U.S. manufacturing expansion to reestablish Intel as a chip leader, but execution has been bumpy.

Ohio’s factory timeline has slipped into the next decade, while production at its Arizona site, originally slated for this year, is now penciled in for 2025. Despite these delays, the company has spent $30 billion so far on its U.S. buildout, banking on the CHIPS Act to sustain momentum.

**Racing Against the Clock**

With Trump’s team criticizing the CHIPS Act as wasteful, the Biden administration is racing to wrap up grant agreements before the presidential handoff in January. Intel’s funding offers a critical boost as the company juggles job cuts, strategic reviews, and an uphill battle to reclaim its tech edge.

The $7.9 billion is more than just a lifeline—it’s a vote of confidence in Intel’s role as America’s chipmaking champion. Whether it can deliver on that promise remains to be seen.

# Walmart Raises Outlook on Strong Spending From Value-Seekers

Walmart is sprinkling a little early holiday cheer on Wall Street. 

The retail giant reported stronger-than-expected sales, raised its annual outlook, and sent its stock to an all-time high. Adjusted earnings hit $0.58 per share, beating analyst forecasts of $0.53, while revenue soared 5% year over year to $169.59 billion, easily outpacing expectations.

**High-Income Shoppers, Bigger Baskets**  
  
Interestingly, it wasn’t just budget-conscious shoppers driving Walmart’s gains. High-income households, making over $100,000 annually, accounted for 75% of the quarter’s share growth. 

Shoppers were also spending more per trip, with the average ticket size increasing by 2.1%. And while discretionary items like toys and home goods finally showed some growth, groceries remain Walmart’s bread and butter.

**E-Commerce Is a Bright Spot:** Walmart’s online presence continues to shine, with e-commerce sales climbing 22%. Customers aren’t just shopping online—they’re paying extra for speedier deliveries, with 30% of orders now including a premium fee. 

Walmart’s digital strategy, bolstered by curbside pickups and its expanding third-party marketplace, is inching closer to profitability.

**Tariffs, Weather, and the Road Ahead:** Despite the holiday buzz, storm clouds loom. President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs could push prices higher, potentially testing Walmart’s ""everyday low prices"" mantra. Warm weather has also dampened demand for seasonal items like clothing and heaters.

Still, Walmart’s diversified sourcing strategy and ability to attract high-income customers may help it weather these challenges, leaving competitors trailing as the retail giant marches into the holiday season with confidence.

# Qualcomm Expects to Make $22 Billion by 2029 From Expansion Bid

Qualcomm is dialing up its ambitions. 

The chipmaker announced that it expects $22 billion in additional annual revenue by 2029, fueled by expansions into PCs, automotive, and industrial applications. CEO Cristiano Amon’s strategy to diversify beyond smartphone chips, which still account for 75% of Qualcomm’s sales, seems to be gaining traction.

**PCs, Cars, and Everything Else**  
  
Qualcomm projects $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a significant move into a market dominated by Intel. Automotive chips are expected to contribute $8 billion annually, a 175% increase from current levels, with 80% of that tied to existing contracts.

Other promising segments include industrial chips ($4 billion) and headsets ($2 billion). The company is also targeting opportunities in wireless headphones, tablets, and more.

**The Apple Problem and AI Opportunity**  
  
While Qualcomm is spreading its wings, it faces headwinds. Apple, a major customer, could cut ties as early as 2027, impacting modem sales. But Qualcomm’s focus on “edge AI”—bringing advanced AI capabilities to devices rather than relying on cloud computing—offers a potential lifeline. 

Executives suggested that chips running on smartphones today could soon handle tasks previously reserved for massive server farms.

**The Big Picture:** Qualcomm’s push to reduce reliance on smartphones is a response to shifting industry dynamics, like Apple’s in-house chip efforts and the growing demand for diversified tech solutions. With a total addressable market estimated at $900 billion by 2030, Qualcomm’s roadmap appears ambitious but calculated. 

However, with competition heating up in PCs and automotive, execution will be key to achieving these lofty goals.

Bowman made headlines back in September as the lone dissenter when the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, marking the first time in 20 years a Fed governor broke from the pack on a monetary policy decision. Talk about standing out.

# Walmart Raises Outlook on Strong Spending From Value-Seekers

Walmart is sprinkling a little early holiday cheer on Wall Street. 

The retail giant reported stronger-than-expected sales, raised its annual outlook, and sent its stock to an all-time high. Adjusted earnings hit $0.58 per share, beating analyst forecasts of $0.53, while revenue soared 5% year over year to $169.59 billion, easily outpacing expectations.

**High-Income Shoppers, Bigger Baskets**  
  
Interestingly, it wasn’t just budget-conscious shoppers driving Walmart’s gains. High-income households, making over $100,000 annually, accounted for 75% of the quarter’s share growth. 

Shoppers were also spending more per trip, with the average ticket size increasing by 2.1%. And while discretionary items like toys and home goods finally showed some growth, groceries remain Walmart’s bread and butter.

**E-Commerce Is a Bright Spot:** Walmart’s online presence continues to shine, with e-commerce sales climbing 22%. Customers aren’t just shopping online—they’re paying extra for speedier deliveries, with 30% of orders now including a premium fee. 

Walmart’s digital strategy, bolstered by curbside pickups and its expanding third-party marketplace, is inching closer to profitability.

**Tariffs, Weather, and the Road Ahead:** Despite the holiday buzz, storm clouds loom. President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs could push prices higher, potentially testing Walmart’s ""everyday low prices"" mantra. Warm weather has also dampened demand for seasonal items like clothing and heaters.

Still, Walmart’s diversified sourcing strategy and ability to attract high-income customers may help it weather these challenges, leaving competitors trailing as the retail giant marches into the holiday season with confidence.

# Qualcomm Expects to Make $22 Billion by 2029 From Expansion Bid

Qualcomm is dialing up its ambitions. 

The chipmaker announced that it expects $22 billion in additional annual revenue by 2029, fueled by expansions into PCs, automotive, and industrial applications. CEO Cristiano Amon’s strategy to diversify beyond smartphone chips, which still account for 75% of Qualcomm’s sales, seems to be gaining traction.

**PCs, Cars, and Everything Else**  
  
Qualcomm projects $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a significant move into a market dominated by Intel. Automotive chips are expected to contribute $8 billion annually, a 175% increase from current levels, with 80% of that tied to existing contracts.

Other promising segments include industrial chips ($4 billion) and headsets ($2 billion). The company is also targeting opportunities in wireless headphones, tablets, and more.

**The Apple Problem and AI Opportunity**  
  
While Qualcomm is spreading its wings, it faces headwinds. Apple, a major customer, could cut ties as early as 2027, impacting modem sales. But Qualcomm’s focus on “edge AI”—bringing advanced AI capabilities to devices rather than relying on cloud computing—offers a potential lifeline. 

Executives suggested that chips running on smartphones today could soon handle tasks previously reserved for massive server farms.

**The Big Picture:** Qualcomm’s push to reduce reliance on smartphones is a response to shifting industry dynamics, like Apple’s in-house chip efforts and the growing demand for diversified tech solutions. With a total addressable market estimated at $900 billion by 2030, Qualcomm’s roadmap appears ambitious but calculated. 

However, with competition heating up in PCs and automotive, execution will be key to achieving these lofty goals.

No major economic data is dropping tomorrow, but keep an ear out for a few Federal Reserve governors speaking at various events—including Michelle Bowman, a name you might remember.

Bowman made headlines back in September as the lone dissenter when the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, marking the first time in 20 years a Fed governor broke from the pack on a monetary policy decision. Talk about standing out.

Though she sided with the crew this month on a 25-basis-point cut, Bowman’s willingness to go against the grain makes her remarks tomorrow something to watch.

# Walmart Raises Outlook on Strong Spending From Value-Seekers

Walmart is sprinkling a little early holiday cheer on Wall Street. 

The retail giant reported stronger-than-expected sales, raised its annual outlook, and sent its stock to an all-time high. Adjusted earnings hit $0.58 per share, beating analyst forecasts of $0.53, while revenue soared 5% year over year to $169.59 billion, easily outpacing expectations.

**High-Income Shoppers, Bigger Baskets**  
  
Interestingly, it wasn’t just budget-conscious shoppers driving Walmart’s gains. High-income households, making over $100,000 annually, accounted for 75% of the quarter’s share growth. 

Shoppers were also spending more per trip, with the average ticket size increasing by 2.1%. And while discretionary items like toys and home goods finally showed some growth, groceries remain Walmart’s bread and butter.

**E-Commerce Is a Bright Spot:** Walmart’s online presence continues to shine, with e-commerce sales climbing 22%. Customers aren’t just shopping online—they’re paying extra for speedier deliveries, with 30% of orders now including a premium fee. 

Walmart’s digital strategy, bolstered by curbside pickups and its expanding third-party marketplace, is inching closer to profitability.

**Tariffs, Weather, and the Road Ahead:** Despite the holiday buzz, storm clouds loom. President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs could push prices higher, potentially testing Walmart’s ""everyday low prices"" mantra. Warm weather has also dampened demand for seasonal items like clothing and heaters.

Still, Walmart’s diversified sourcing strategy and ability to attract high-income customers may help it weather these challenges, leaving competitors trailing as the retail giant marches into the holiday season with confidence.

# Qualcomm Expects to Make $22 Billion by 2029 From Expansion Bid

Qualcomm is dialing up its ambitions. 

The chipmaker announced that it expects $22 billion in additional annual revenue by 2029, fueled by expansions into PCs, automotive, and industrial applications. CEO Cristiano Amon’s strategy to diversify beyond smartphone chips, which still account for 75% of Qualcomm’s sales, seems to be gaining traction.

**PCs, Cars, and Everything Else**  
  
Qualcomm projects $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a significant move into a market dominated by Intel. Automotive chips are expected to contribute $8 billion annually, a 175% increase from current levels, with 80% of that tied to existing contracts.

Other promising segments include industrial chips ($4 billion) and headsets ($2 billion). The company is also targeting opportunities in wireless headphones, tablets, and more.

**The Apple Problem and AI Opportunity**  
  
While Qualcomm is spreading its wings, it faces headwinds. Apple, a major customer, could cut ties as early as 2027, impacting modem sales. But Qualcomm’s focus on “edge AI”—bringing advanced AI capabilities to devices rather than relying on cloud computing—offers a potential lifeline. 

Executives suggested that chips running on smartphones today could soon handle tasks previously reserved for massive server farms.

**The Big Picture:** Qualcomm’s push to reduce reliance on smartphones is a response to shifting industry dynamics, like Apple’s in-house chip efforts and the growing demand for diversified tech solutions. With a total addressable market estimated at $900 billion by 2030, Qualcomm’s roadmap appears ambitious but calculated. 

However, with competition heating up in PCs and automotive, execution will be key to achieving these lofty goals.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

No major economic data is dropping tomorrow, but keep an ear out for a few Federal Reserve governors speaking at various events—including Michelle Bowman, a name you might remember.

Bowman made headlines back in September as the lone dissenter when the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, marking the first time in 20 years a Fed governor broke from the pack on a monetary policy decision. Talk about standing out.

Though she sided with the crew this month on a 25-basis-point cut, Bowman’s willingness to go against the grain makes her remarks tomorrow something to watch.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Target** may be a household favorite, but even fan favorites feel the squeeze. Earlier this year, the retailer slashed prices on thousands of products to entice budget-conscious shoppers—and they’re gearing up to do it again for the holiday season. Despite the markdown marathon, Target’s bottom line has stayed relatively steady, and analysts expect the previous quarter to hold up well. Still, shareholders are likely asking the big question: When does the discounting spree end? For now, the consensus calls for $2.30 EPS on $25.96 billion in revenue. ($TGT)

# After Market Close: 

* **Nvidia** continues to play the MVP role in the stock market. Its Magnificent 7 counterparts delivered solid earnings this quarter, and all eyes are on whether the chip titan—up nearly 190% this year—has more fuel in the tank. For those fearing they’re late to the AI boom, analysts are betting there’s plenty of runway left. With AI demand showing no signs of cooling, Nvidia remains the undisputed king of the semiconductor hill. Consensus estimates peg earnings at $0.74 per share on $32.86 billion in revenue.

Where consumers will spend less while trying to get more walmart will be a solution. Stores like costco or even sam's where people have to buy in bulk will make it harder for consumers to get lower priced items. In return it will make it where they shop around more in ""normal"" stores like walmart or krogers or mejier which most have strick shipping cost.

Walmart told CNBC the decision to sell its stake will allow the company to “focus on our strong China operations for Walmart China and Sam’s Club, and deploy capital towards other priorities.”

The company said “JD has been a valued partner to us over the past 8 years, and we are committed to a continued commercial relationship with them.”

# Breaking Up Google? DOJ Considers a Historic Move

Google ($GOOGL) has long reigned supreme with its trifecta of Search, Android, and YouTube, but its days of unchecked dominance might be numbered. After a federal court ruled that Google’s been playing monopoly with the internet search market, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering some drastic measures that could permanently alter Google’s empire—and send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# Google’s Breakup Drama

For the first time in over 20 years, the DOJ is mulling over the breakup of a major tech company, and Google’s in the crosshairs. This isn’t just a slap on the wrist; the DOJ is reportedly considering forcing Google to shed some of its most profitable assets. Imagine Google Ads—responsible for a staggering $238 billion in 2023—being spun off into a separate entity. That’s just one option on the table. Another scenario could see Google being forced to sell off its Android operating system or Chrome browser, two products that are practically synonymous with the internet itself. The potential breakup could not only reshape Google but could also set a new precedent for regulating other tech giants.

# Flashback to Microsoft’s 2000 Antitrust Battle

If this all sounds familiar, it’s because we’ve seen something like this before. Back in 2000, the DOJ went after Microsoft for its near-total control over the PC market. While the attempt to break up Microsoft was eventually overturned on appeal, the case did lead to restrictions that slowed down the tech giant’s dominance just enough to allow new players—like Google—to rise. Now, Google might find itself in a similar position. The DOJ could impose rules that force Google to share its valuable data and technology with competitors or ban it from entering exclusive contracts that keep rivals at bay. Case in point: Google’s $26 billion splurge to secure default search engine status on iPhones and Firefox. These kinds of practices could soon be a thing of the past.

# Silicon Valley on High Alert

While Google is currently the star of this antitrust drama, every other tech behemoth—from Amazon to Apple to Meta—is watching with bated breath. The outcome of Google’s case could have far-reaching consequences, especially as these companies face their own antitrust challenges. A decision to break up Google could embolden regulators to take a tougher stance across the board, fundamentally altering the landscape of the tech industry. The DOJ is set to reveal its proposed remedies in September, and until then, all of Silicon Valley is on edge, knowing that the stakes have never been higher.

* **US Same-Store Sales Growth:** 4.2%
* **E-Commerce Growth:** 22% in the U.S.
* **Full-Year Sales Guidance:** 3.75% to 4.75%

# Walmart’s Winning Streak

Walmart ($WMT) just dropped some numbers, and it looks like they're riding high on the wave of deal-seeking shoppers. The retail giant raised its full-year sales outlook, now predicting a rise of up to 4.75%, a bump from its previous cap of 4%. Thanks to a growing number of customers—especially those from higher-income brackets—scouring for bargains, Walmart's stock surged today, marking its biggest intraday gain since late 2022.

The real juice? E-commerce sales in the U.S. shot up by 22%, largely driven by pickups and Walmart’s third-party marketplace. This growth wasn’t just in the grocery aisles either; after 11 quarters of decline, general merchandise sales finally showed some life. Seasonal items like pool noodles were particularly popular—so much so that you could stretch all the noodles sold across 30,000 football fields. That’s a lot of backyard fun.

# Cautious Optimism Amid Economic Uncertainty

Walmart’s success contrasts sharply with other retailers like Home Depot ($HD) and Whirlpool ($WHR), which have been struggling as consumers put off big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, Walmart continues to rake in customers across all income levels, including a significant chunk from wealthier households hunting for deals.

With the back-to-school season off to a strong start and inflationary pressures easing a bit, Walmart’s cautious optimism about the rest of the year seems well-placed. The retailer is focusing on keeping prices down, pushing suppliers to do the same, and expanding its high-margin businesses like advertising and membership programs. And with more shoppers tightening their belts and opting for at-home dining over takeout, Walmart’s grocery dominance is likely to continue driving growth.

# Breaking Up Google? DOJ Considers a Historic Move

Google ($GOOGL) has long reigned supreme with its trifecta of Search, Android, and YouTube, but its days of unchecked dominance might be numbered. After a federal court ruled that Google’s been playing monopoly with the internet search market, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering some drastic measures that could permanently alter Google’s empire—and send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# Google’s Breakup Drama

For the first time in over 20 years, the DOJ is mulling over the breakup of a major tech company, and Google’s in the crosshairs. This isn’t just a slap on the wrist; the DOJ is reportedly considering forcing Google to shed some of its most profitable assets. Imagine Google Ads—responsible for a staggering $238 billion in 2023—being spun off into a separate entity. That’s just one option on the table. Another scenario could see Google being forced to sell off its Android operating system or Chrome browser, two products that are practically synonymous with the internet itself. The potential breakup could not only reshape Google but could also set a new precedent for regulating other tech giants.

# Flashback to Microsoft’s 2000 Antitrust Battle

If this all sounds familiar, it’s because we’ve seen something like this before. Back in 2000, the DOJ went after Microsoft for its near-total control over the PC market. While the attempt to break up Microsoft was eventually overturned on appeal, the case did lead to restrictions that slowed down the tech giant’s dominance just enough to allow new players—like Google—to rise. Now, Google might find itself in a similar position. The DOJ could impose rules that force Google to share its valuable data and technology with competitors or ban it from entering exclusive contracts that keep rivals at bay. Case in point: Google’s $26 billion splurge to secure default search engine status on iPhones and Firefox. These kinds of practices could soon be a thing of the past.

# Silicon Valley on High Alert

While Google is currently the star of this antitrust drama, every other tech behemoth—from Amazon to Apple to Meta—is watching with bated breath. The outcome of Google’s case could have far-reaching consequences, especially as these companies face their own antitrust challenges. A decision to break up Google could embolden regulators to take a tougher stance across the board, fundamentally altering the landscape of the tech industry. The DOJ is set to reveal its proposed remedies in September, and until then, all of Silicon Valley is on edge, knowing that the stakes have never been higher.

# Walmart Q2 Surge: Higher Sales, Raised Outlook

* **E-Commerce Growth:** 22% in the U.S.
* **Full-Year Sales Guidance:** 3.75% to 4.75%

# Walmart’s Winning Streak

Walmart ($WMT) just dropped some numbers, and it looks like they're riding high on the wave of deal-seeking shoppers. The retail giant raised its full-year sales outlook, now predicting a rise of up to 4.75%, a bump from its previous cap of 4%. Thanks to a growing number of customers—especially those from higher-income brackets—scouring for bargains, Walmart's stock surged today, marking its biggest intraday gain since late 2022.

The real juice? E-commerce sales in the U.S. shot up by 22%, largely driven by pickups and Walmart’s third-party marketplace. This growth wasn’t just in the grocery aisles either; after 11 quarters of decline, general merchandise sales finally showed some life. Seasonal items like pool noodles were particularly popular—so much so that you could stretch all the noodles sold across 30,000 football fields. That’s a lot of backyard fun.

# Cautious Optimism Amid Economic Uncertainty

Walmart’s success contrasts sharply with other retailers like Home Depot ($HD) and Whirlpool ($WHR), which have been struggling as consumers put off big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, Walmart continues to rake in customers across all income levels, including a significant chunk from wealthier households hunting for deals.

With the back-to-school season off to a strong start and inflationary pressures easing a bit, Walmart’s cautious optimism about the rest of the year seems well-placed. The retailer is focusing on keeping prices down, pushing suppliers to do the same, and expanding its high-margin businesses like advertising and membership programs. And with more shoppers tightening their belts and opting for at-home dining over takeout, Walmart’s grocery dominance is likely to continue driving growth.

1ctaa8b_WMT,WMT,Walmart earnings beat as discounter wins over more high-income shoppers ,"Walmart on Thursday topped quarterly revenue and earnings expectations, as the discounter made significant e-commerce gains, drove profits with newer businesses like advertising and won over more high-income shoppers.

The big-box retailer said it now expects to hit the high-end or slightly top its previous full-year guidance. Walmart had expected net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said one of the factors boosting Walmart’s grocery business is the widening gap between the price of cooking at home and buying food at restaurants.

Plus, he added, shoppers – especially with higher-incomes – appreciate the convenience that Walmart offers. For the first time, its delivery business surpassed its store pickup in terms of volume, Rainey said.

“We’ve got customers that are coming to us more frequently than they have before and newer customers that we haven’t traditionally had, and they’re coming into a Walmart whether it’s a virtual store online, or whether it’s one of our physical stores,” he said.

Here’s what the discounter reported for the three-month period that ended April 30 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 60 cents adjusted vs. 52 cents expected

Revenue: $161.51 billion vs. $159.50 billion

Walmart’s net income jumped to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared with $1.67 billion, or 21 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue climbed 6% from $152.30 billion in the year-ago quarter. That increase includes a benefit of roughly 1% from an additional selling day in the period. 

As the nation’s largest retailer and private employer, Walmart is often viewed as a bellwether for the U.S. economy. Yet it has generally fared better during an inflationary period than other retailers because it sells staples like groceries and has a value-oriented reputation. That trend continued in the quarter, as the company 

Same-store sales for Walmart U.S. climbed by 3.8%, excluding fuel. The industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. At Sam’s Club, same-store sales rose 4.4% year over year, excluding fuel.

E-commerce sales shot up by 22% year over year for Walmart U.S., fueled by store pickup and delivery of online orders, as well as the company’s growing third-party marketplace. 

The company also grew high-margin businesses like advertising as it pushes to increase its earnings faster than its sales.

1c93ovj_WMT,WMT,WMT vs COST? ,"Disclaimer: I own WMT shares. 

I’m curious what you guys think about how these two compare 

Being as how Walmart has a significant presence in both general retail/groceries *and* warehouse sales, wouldn’t it make sense to invest in them over Costco? 

Walmart has a rapidly expanding e-commerce presence, a wide moat and is consistently looking for additional sources of revenue (Vizio purchase, Ibotta investment etc). What would make an investor chose Costco over Walmart? 

Genuinely curious, I feel that it’s a case of some feeling that Walmart is a “jack of all trades” and thus a master of none, while Costco does one thing but they do it *really* well. I have some disagreements with this logic but I would genuinely love some new perspective to open my eyes. ",2024-04-20,35,69

I’m interested in owning WMT long term. I also have it stuck in my head that I always need to own 100 shares of a stock bc of option trading. Am I correct in my thinking, due to lack of spare cash on hand at the moment, once the split happens buy an ITM LEAP call with the intention of actually letting it get exercised, as long as it stays ITM. Basically trying to lock into the new split price now to purchase later. Understanding the true cost of this purchase would be the BE price. Good or bad idea since I want to own it in the long run.

1amq2kx_IBM,IBM,What Walmart’s ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.,"Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart’s weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.

It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively. 

Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.

The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.

Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.

With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I’m eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.  

Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.

* Walmart is studying changes in sales patterns by looking at anonymized shopper data and comparing that of people who take a weight loss drug like Ozempic to people who don’t, but Furner said it’s too soon to draw conclusions.
* The company is seeing “a slight pullback in overall basket” when looking at the consumer data, though, for people who take Ozempic, Wegovy or other popular weight-loss drugs, Furner told Bloomberg.
* Furner said the pullback has been “just less units, slightly less calories,” Bloomberg reported.
* Companies like Walmart are working to take stock of shopper trends for people on Ozempic as the weight-loss drug is only expected to continue its rise in popularity: Morgan Stanley is estimating that 24 million people—or 7% of the U.S. population—could be taking GLP-1 drugs by 2035.
* In its September report, Morgan Stanley said the popularity of these drugs will likely have a stronger impact on grocery stores, while big box markets like Walmart and Target that sell “many product categories along with food will be better insulated.”

Walmart U.S. chief executive John Furner said in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday that the company has seen “a slight change” in food purchasing habits of people taking Ozempic and other weight loss drugs compared to people who aren’t—as impacts of the popular medication seep into the corporate world.

Ozempic, Wegovy and other weight loss drugs that have risen in popularity in recent years cause weight loss by reducing people’s appetites. The GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone that signals to one’s brain that they’re full, according to UC Davis Health. The drug has also decreased some patients' cravings to eat foods with high sugar or fat content, though, CNBC reported, which could cause problems for some food brands that have decided in recent years to lean into snacking while marketing their food.

WMT used to be known as a growth stock as it reported double-digit sales growth from the mid-1980s to 2007.  It is now a single-digit growth story as it hasn't kept up with the likes of Home Depot.  And everyone knows the story du jour of WMT, that it is expanding into groceries to try to continue its revenue growth (a la China's Alibaba Group).

WMT released its 2022 results last week and they nonetheless reflect the steadiness we have come to expect from America's largest retailer.  The top line growth was 6.7% year over year but the average such growth for the last 5 years is around 4%.  The gross margin was 24.1% and there is probably nothing more steadier than WMT's gross margin: the 5-year mean is 24.8%.  The EBITDA margin is also fairly steady at 5% (5Y mean = 6%).  The EBITDA multiple is 14.5x LTM and on a forward basis, is 12.2x.  The P/E multiple is 33x LTM vs. 23x for 2023E.  So obviously the company looks pretty expensive from the P/E standpoint ... perhaps because it is still being accorded rock star (i.e., growth stock) status.

Walmart has been steadily buying back its shares since ... as far back as 1997.  It had 4.6b shares outstanding at the time.  Now there are 2.7b shares, a decrease of 41%.  So naturally the stock price would show stratospheric rise unrelated to earnings or FCF growth just based on this shrinkage alone. But as far as buybacks go, even Walmart isn't the company to focus on (Home Depot is).

Aside from share buybacks being done on a low-key scale (compared to those who are really going after them like they're going for oil), there isn't much remarkable about Walmart's results.  The company averages 2% capex and requires -3% working capital both as %s of revenue.  FCF varies greatly as items can vary based on one time and non-recurring occurrences, NWC levels, tax rates, credits, etc.  The 5Y average FCF is around $15.6b, the median is $17.2; the midpoint is something like $16.3b - necessary to normalize since WMT needed higher NWC & capex in 2022.  However, the high-end FCF number could be as high as $21b using analysts' revenue estimate of $631b for 2023E. Btw, this is unlevered FCF designed to subtract net debt upon discounting (so start from NOPAT, not NI).

Now that we know the approximate level of FCF, we can apply valuation methods to derive WMT's fair price per share.  The first task is to see what would be the cap rate (DR - g) given today's firm value of $455b.  At \~$16b in FCF, the implied cap rate is 3.6%, equal to a multiple of 28x FCF.  That's very high so we try to value WMT using appropriate discount rates for debt and equity for the intervening years prior to the terminal year.

WMT has 18% debt and 82% equity: it's AA-rated and the 20Y debt rate is 5.1% pretax.  Its beta is around 0.8 and the 20Y Treasury rate is \~4.0% so the cost of equity is 8.8% using 6% in equity risk premium.  On an after-tax basis (using 31% tax rate) to discount the FCF, the blended discount rate is around 8%.  The inflation rate is very high as of now and people doubt we can get the long-term rate down to 2%.  So we'll use 3% as the long-term growth rate of WMT.  This may seem too low but consider: For the last 10 years, WMT averaged 2.7% in growth; the median is only 2.2%.  This is why we keep saying, this is no growth stock.

Using \~$16b in FCF and 3% as the constant growth rate and 8% as DR, EV = $325b, subtract net debt, and P = $92 per share.   How about using a 2 stage model with a higher growth rate of 6% for the next 3 years since WMT did 6.7% YOY in 2022?  That results in $353b in EV and $102 in stock price.  How about a more realistic scenario of 6% YOY growth slowing to 3% in 3 years?  $340b in EV and P = $97.  Now try an EBITDA exit multiple of 14x combined with 1Y of FCF, discounted, that is, for the next 12 months:  that results in $455b in EV and $141 in current stock price (we really backed into the stock price using the LTM EBITDA multiple here).

Now try the high-end FCF of $21b using the above assumptions and you get $400b in EV and $120.  So under the most optimistic scenario, you still cannot reach the current level of $141.

WMT is fairly valued between $90 and $120, not at $141.  Incidentally, at $90, the LTM and 2023E EBITDA multiples come down to 10x and 9x while P/Es decline to 21x and 15x, which are very reasonable levels given that WMT should no longer behave like a growth stock.  WMT would be fairly valued if the stock fell 30% to around $100.   At $141, it is about 40% overvalued right now.

Edit:  sorry, had to clarify re FCF, that's it's unlevered and had to use assumptions to normalize.  Doesn't change conclusions but you cannot just use 1Y of FCF and assume that's normalized since CF/BS items can fluctuate greatly unlike IS items.  But this is a mature company with not that much growth -- growth the last 10Y has been no higher than the inflation rate.  WMT's highest FCF was in 2017 and 2020, in the rearview mirror.  Groceries are the new mantra.

Edit:  Check out inside activity and you can see that the Waltons have sold $1.1b worth of stock in late February at $141-$143 and CEO McMillion sold $2.3mm at $143.  They still have substantial holdings but $140ish was a good exit point out of WMT for attaining liquidity.  No strong insider buys nor significant buyside activity by active funds at these $140.  That should give you caution if you're ever swayed by Wall Street's sell-side research analysts that have been issuing ""Strong Buy"" ratings on WMT.  Do not be seduced by stock promoters. You'll be buying an ocean-front property in Arkansaw.",2023-03-04,87,79

**Last Week – SPY holding a tight range for Feb, so far.**

SPY traded in about a 2.5% range and finished more or less unchanged on the week. That was versus options that were pricing about a 2.2% move for the week. In fact, the SPX has traded in a fairly tight 3% range for February so far. That’s despite a slew of important economic releases and volatile earnings announcements that could have been market-moving. Implied volatility remains on the lower end of the option premium prices we’ve seen over the past year. The VIX got as low as 18 following the CPI release but closed the week back above 21. The market saw a bounce on Friday that kept it from falling below that February range, a move that would have seen IV spike a bit.

**This Week – Downside level of February range one to watch for IV.**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.5% move for the holiday-shortened week. The $404.50 level that SPY tested on Friday is one to watch as moves lower than that low end of the recent range could see put protection buying and higher IV. The FOMC minutes on Wednesday and the GDP print on Thursday are ones to watch on the economic calendar. Nvidia, Walmart, Coinbase, Carvana and Block highlight the earnings calendar.

As mentioned in recent weeks, although the overall market IV is on the low end of what we’ve seen the past year, there are some large idiosyncratic moves happening in single stock names. particularly stocks that saw large declines in 2022, as the potential for large percentage moves from a low stock price can sometimes be difficult for options to price. Carvana is a good example below, it’s seen moves of 40% in its last two earnings, with options trying to price the possibility of a move like that, or the chance of it not moving at all, and seemingly splitting the difference with an expected move of around 24%. The stock is just $11 now and has seen a high of over $18 and a low near $10 this month alone. Massive percentage moves that are difficult for the options market to price as the straddles to account for the potential of a stock doubling would be nearly the entire stock price to zero on the downside.

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 5.9% last week and has now bounced about 12% from the 2022 lows (made in mid October.) It is about 17% away from its all-time closing highs (Dec ’21).

The big move higher last week came after a tamer-than-expected CPI print that has market participants thinking the Fed is now done with its 75 basis point hikes.

The 5.9% was obviously alot more than the 2.6% move options were pricing. But once again, because the move was to the upside, combined with most of the big cap earnings, the election, the FOMC decision, and CPI now behind us, vol continues to move lower. The VIX is now 22.5. Down from 34 in October. That declining vol has not been a reaction to options overpricing moves over the past month. In fact, the opposite has been true. What it is a sign of is worries of a crash, or continued move lower in the market, whether it be FOMC, Earnings, Election, or inflation data-driven, is now less of a likelihood in the near term. In fact, IV is now lower near-term, than it is out a few months, as seen by this 1 year SPY chart showing expected move levels and IV:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2mg7bcudquz91.gif

Bottom line, with the IV crush that accompanied the market rip higher last week, options are not pricing in a retest of those recent lows anytime soon. (In fact, options aren’t pricing those lows or the near-term (August) high until late Winter.)

And IV, which is about 19 near term in SPY, increases as you go out expiries, with options out in March around 23 IV.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.0% move for the upcoming week or about $8 in either direction. That is down from a 2.6% ($10) move options were pricing last week (actual move \^$22).

Speaking of that $22 move higher, from last week’s post:

>With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher.

Last week didn’t just see a Powerball winner, it also saw some of those lotto ticket upside calls win as well. Perhaps some of it was positioning for the chance of a CPI induced squeeze.

The economic calendar this week sees Retail Sales (as well as several big retail earnings) here in the US. This could be a scenario where hot numbers would be bad for the market because of inflation implications.

**WMT - Tuesday, Nov 15 (Premarket)**

For the fiscal Quarter ended Oct /22, the consensus EPS forecast for WMT is $1.31 based on 14 analysts opinion with an estimated revenue of $146.8B. The previous year's EPS during the same period was $1.45 with $139.21B revenue which beat the estimated by 3.69%.

What happened in the past two earnings?

Earnings reported on May 17/2022 for period ended April 22: $1.30 vs $1.478 estimate EPS. Stock went down -8% to $117 by the end of that week.

Earnings reported on Aug 16/2022 for period ended Jul 22: $1.77 vs $1.619 estimate. Stock gapped up +7.27% to $140.83, but only to quickly fill that gap (that is stock came back down) by the week end.

***The Bigger Picture:***

From the daily chart (D1), we can get a feel for what is about to happen. Bearish hanging man and a dragonfly doji - this could be possibly pointing to a downtrend. We can try to confirm this with the MACD oscillator, and we see a signal line crossing.

What about the analysts, what are they saying?

Out of the 32 analysts, there is a consensus BUY rating. For this earnings tho, I am of a different opinion just by what the chart is showing me.

What is the options chain saying?

(1) Implied volatility is a little bit inflated at 46.07% for the Fri, Nov/18, compared to its historical volatility of 20.14%.

(2) Loaded open interest on both the call and puts side of the chain with a 0.81 put/call open ratio. Unusual options flow - not significant, but couple of $145, $140 & $135 puts and a scattered $148, $143 Calls.

To be very honest, this images presents themselves as conflicting, but I'd like to cross the line here and say for this earning I see a bearish reversal on the horizon unless earnings come in better than estimated. This by no way takes away from the ""strong buy"" that analyst have given this stock. Yes, WMT is a good one and going into the future the stock price may advance - perhaps, no doubt. However, I remain contrarian on this earning.

&#x200B;

**Building up on this, here is a synopsis for TGT and HD**

**HomeDepot ($HD) Earnings Tuesday, Nov 15 (premarket) - EPS estimate of $4.12. Beat analysts' estimate the last two quarters with stock moving up at least 5% for each earnings.** Chart looks strong for this earning and another \~5% move to the upside is possible, that is, if the figures come in as expected or better. Though I see a lot of puts hitting the tape.

**Target ($TGT) Earnings Wednesday, Nov 16 (premarket) -** EPS estimate of $2.14. During the same period last year, the reported EPS was $3.03. The last two earnings came in lower than expected which, of course, resulted in price decline of the stock. We see for period ended April'22 stock fell over 26% in what seems to be an over reaction. Similarly, for the period ended Jul'22 a decline of about -6% came in quickly with the stock closing lower to $158 by the end of that week. We could see a replay of this again, but I'd be cautious.

What is the option chain saying for TGT: Implied volatility, at 88.96%, is inflated with its typical historic volatility at 43.10%. This is for the Nov 18 expiry option chain. More put open interest than calls - put/call open interest ratio at 1.05. Chart looks strong on this one, and there is still gap to fill on this stock. If it runs, it might fill the gap from the earnings on May 17. On the contrary, if it falls as a result of the earning then we could see the price touch the $145 range or below.

yupv0u_WMT,WMT,"Expected Moves This Week, SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Cisco, Walmart and more","## Market View

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 5.9% last week and has now bounced about 12% from the 2022 lows (made in mid October.) It is about 17% away from its all-time closing highs (Dec ’21).

The big move higher last week came after a tamer-than-expected CPI print that has market participants thinking the Fed is now done with its 75 basis point hikes.

The 5.9% was obviously alot more than the 2.6% move options were pricing. But once again, because the move was to the upside, combined with most of the big cap earnings, the election, the FOMC decision, and CPI now behind us, vol continues to move lower. The VIX is now 22.5. Down from 34 in October. That declining vol has not been a reaction to options overpricing moves over the past month. In fact, the opposite has been true. What it is a sign of is worries of a crash, or continued move lower in the market, whether it be FOMC, Earnings, Election, or inflation data-driven, is now less of a likelihood in the near term. In fact, IV is now lower near-term, than it is out a few months, as seen by this 1 year SPY chart showing expected move levels and IV:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2mg7bcudquz91.gif

Bottom line, with the IV crush that accompanied the market rip higher last week, options are not pricing in a retest of those recent lows anytime soon. (In fact, options aren’t pricing those lows or the near-term (August) high until late Winter.)

And IV, which is about 19 near term in SPY, increases as you go out expiries, with options out in March around 23 IV.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.0% move for the upcoming week or about $8 in either direction. That is down from a 2.6% ($10) move options were pricing last week (actual move \^$22).

Speaking of that $22 move higher, from last week’s post:

>With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher.

Last week didn’t just see a Powerball winner, it also saw some of those lotto ticket upside calls win as well. Perhaps some of it was positioning for the chance of a CPI induced squeeze.

The economic calendar this week sees Retail Sales (as well as several big retail earnings) here in the US. This could be a scenario where hot numbers would be bad for the market because of inflation implications.

Walmart Inc. WMT is cutting hundreds of corporate roles in a restructuring effort, according to people familiar with the matter, a week after the retail giant warned of falling profits.

w95v2q_WMT,WMT,WMT and FOMC thoughts,"7.6% drop on WalMart today, off 10.04 for a gap of slightly under 10 points. Interestingly, this represents the second large down gap WMT has made since May. How long it will take to recover remains to be seen, but the point I’d like to bring up is that the bottom line of the news is that WMT is having to further discount prices because merchandise is not selling. 

If people are not shopping at their rollback mega-stores that dot the land, what does that say about American consumer confidence and the financial reserves of the typical WMT shopper? They’re apparently not shopping at AMZN, as they gapped down 5% today or Target, down 3.1%, also a gap.

Food banks across America are facing surging demands according to CNN. Is that a further indicator that the recession is already lapping at our heels? 

The CCI as reported today showed a drop in confidence of 2.7 points to 95.7. Still pretty high compared to a bit over 25% during the Great Recession, but by no means a positive economic number. Also, it’s the third consecutive drop in the CCI.

The silver lining? 

If inflationary pressures > less shopping > price cuts and price cuts = lower corporate profits, then the resulting reaction is deflationary pressure on the market. Oil, gas, lumber and housing prices are all dropping.

 If the Fed is less aggressive in tone tomorrow, they’ll be looking at data like this and the CCI drop today rather than signaling the next hike.

So, if the market reacts favorably to the FOMC news, then I expect WMT to have a bounce through Friday. If the market’s down, then the chart tea leaves I read suggest 117.75-ish as the next support.

Shoppers are also focusing more on non-discretionary items like groceries as inflation makes them more selective. That’s a change that arrived much faster than major retailers had anticipated.

Inventory levels also rose too fast, said executives, causing Walmart to put more goods on sale.  Walmart’s (chose) to buy products aggressively amid supply-chain snarls and rising demand for some goods in past quarters. Product markdowns, when a retailer sells an item at a discount, were $100 million more than expected in the quarter.  Online buying behavior has shifted back to pre-pandemic levels.

* Summary: Sales at the Minneapolis-based retailer (Target) increased in the most recent quarter as shoppers spent more on food and groceries.  On Wednesday, the company said earnings for the April quarter were hurt by higher markdown rates and inventory impairments, and lower-than-expected sales in those discretionary categories (kitchen appliances, television sets and furniture).  Target said that while some prices had risen, wider price increases would continue to be the last lever it would pull to improve profit because it was aware that its customers were seeking affordability.

2. $WMT and $TGT inventory woes are due to appliances, electronics and furniture.  $DG goods rarely exceed a $10 sticker price.  $DG is not paying for premium warehouse space to sit on TVs and furniture that they will mark down in the future, like $WMT and $TGT.
3. $DG does not have a large online shopping infrastructure like $WMT and $TGT.  This means they won't see the pull back in online shopping and incremental costs like $WMT.  Let's be honest, $DG's customers shop online at $WISH (Calls on $WISH).
4. $DG stores are located close to the consumer.  Their store placement is driven by getting close to where the consumer lives, works and goes to school.  If gas is too expensive, you can walk or ride your rascal to the local $DG.
5. Both $WMT and $TGT are hesitant to raise prices on consumer essentials because they know their shoppers would just go to $DG who has very low operational costs and can afford to offer the lowest prices on these goods.
6. Here's some real world DD.  Look what you can get from $DG for $20!  You can feed yourself for a few days here.  Take your earnings from Wendy's and go shop at $DG when you get tired of Chicken Nuggets.

$DG is not $WMT and $TGT and their shares should recover from the punishment they took with $WMT and $TGT last week.  $DG could make $230/share by Friday.  If you buy calls, get in before earnings on Thursday.  Even $DG bagholding should be rewarded during the recession.

From the 2 minutes of reading I've done, what you need is canned goods, water...sound familiar ? Same shit we needed when we went into lockdown

I'm sure we all were annoyed at long lines last time hoarding happened, I'm guessing hoarding will be even more aggressive this time as people realize that hoarding is going to happen and we are gonna run out of toilet paper again or whatever. Sprinkle in rising food prices and now you've got double the reason to buy a bunch of food now. WMT COST TGT all outperformed S&P March/April 2020, but they didn't really run too hard so this is a narrative play, as soon as the news runs articles about people hoarding again it's time to sell

ra8g19_WMT,WMT,Walmart Inc. (Ticker: WMT) - Brief Breakdown,"For the full breakdown be sure to check out our substack [here](https://greencandleinvestments.substack.com/).  


Company Description

Walmart Inc. is a retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount department stores, and grocery stores in three segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam’s Club. As of the end of Q3 2021, Walmart has 10,566 stores and clubs in 24 countries, operating under 48 different names. Walmart also owns and operates ecommerce websites such as walmart.com, asda.com, flipkart.com, and samsclub.com, as well as international ecommerce sites and mobile commerce applications. The company offers a wide range of products, including food/beverages, florals, health and beauty aids, baby products, household supplies, pet supplies, electronics, sporting goods, furniture, and much more.  


Quantitative Analysis

At the time of this writing (12/5/2021), WMT  is trading at $137.51 with a 52 week range of $126.28 - $152.57 and a market cap of $383.45B. In Q4 of 2021, WMT’s consolidated net income decreased from $20,008 million to $8,299 million year-over-year (YoY) but averaged a 3.3% return on assets. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \*100) of WMT is 9.7% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 1.41%. The debt to equities ratio (total liabilities / total equity) is 1.87.  


Qualitative Analysis

Walmart is one of the most well known retail stores globally and was the largest company by revenue in 2020. Due to Walmart’s low prices, wage inflation seems to be one of the worries going forward. But Walmart has shown that at its core, it has an unmatched ability to scale and can be agile and adaptable in times of economic uncertainty. For example, Walmart was quick to roll out consumer-friendly ecommerce capabilities in 2020 when many physical stores faced pandemic-related drops in traffic. Walmart’s ecommerce platform has grown rapidly and with the addition of Walmart+, they have become one of the few companies poised to compete with Amazon. Walmart+ offers similar delivery services at a cheaper price than Amazon Prime and gives customers the option to purchase items in their many brick and mortar stores or through their online platform. Walmart has also teamed up with Shopify to allow sellers to use their online platform to sell their own products.

Bullish Thesis

Here are three points to support the bullish thesis: 

* Brand Name: Walmart’s brand name and brand power cannot be measured. It recently launched Walmart+ delivery service and grew at a rapid rate. Currently Walmart still has higher revenue than Amazon and that is in part due to the loyalty of their customers and the familiarity with the products Walmart and its subsidiaries offer. At the end of 2020, Walmart reported $559 billion in revenue while Amazon reported $386 billion. Even with the COVID pandemic and not having as much brick and mortar sales, their online presence and delivery service was enough to still have a successful 2020.

&#x200B;

* Brick and Mortar Footprint: Walmart has 10,566 brick and mortar stores in 24 different countries giving it the largest global footprint of any retail store. With more and more in person shopping occurring, it is easy to think that online shopping may decrease and as that continues to occur, Walmart is primed to continue to lead all businesses in revenue with the combination of the brick and mortar stores and online presence. The amount of stores and various locations truly speak for themselves and no other business can compete with Walmart in that aspect.

&#x200B;

* Adaptability: One thing Walmart proved during the Covid-19 pandemic and shut downs, is its adaptability. Walmart quickly created and mastered a mobile application, Walmart+ delivery service, and ecommerce site. Walmart seems like the only player big enough to go toe to toe with the likes of Amazon and the rapid growth of their online platforms have shown that. In order to compete in an ever changing environment due to COVID, extreme inflation, supply chain issues, and many other potential problems with Walmart’s business, Walmart will need to be able to adjust and adjust quickly in order to maintain revenue and keep growing.

Bearish Thesis

Here are three points to support the bearish thesis: 

* Elephant in the Room - Amazon: While Walmart was able to quickly adapt to pandemic-related reductions in in-person traffic by expanding their ecommerce capabilities, they remain well behind online retailer Amazon. Indeed, according to statista, as of October 2021, Amazon accounted for 41% of the ecommerce retail market while Walmart accounted for just 6.6%. As economies reopen and in-person shopping returns, I imagine Amazon’s market share will only increase. This leaves me wondering where Walmart’s growth will come from - if their physical footprint returns to pre-pandemic levels AND their newly developed ecommerce platforms ultimately fail to compete with Amazon, what will they have to attract investors?

&#x200B;

* Potential Slow Down in Consumer Spending: Last month’s inflation numbers were the worst the U.S. has seen in three decades. As inflation continues to worsen, some suspect that consumer spending will decrease. Although the most recent data show a 1.3% increase in consumer spending from September to October, savings rates in the U.S. have already fallen back to pre-pandemic levels. In my opinion, people are digging into the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic to spend ahead of the holiday season - if these savings dry up and prices continue to rise, it’s likely that consumer spending will drop. If this scenario unfolds, it will hurt retail outlets like Walmart, particularly in segments related to unnecessary goods and services.

&#x200B;

* Global Supply Chains: Walmart operates worldwide and relies heavily on global supply chains working efficiently and, perhaps more importantly, reliably. As I’m sure you’ve heard, supply chain woes have plagued the economy over the last year. Low workforces, economic lockdowns, travel restrictions, backed up ports, and raw material shortages, amongst other things, have all contributed to a breakdown in global supply chains. In response to these issues, retail giant Amazon has started chartering its own shipping vessels and making its own shipping containers, effectively taking more control over its supply chain. While Walmart has followed suit by chartering their own vessels, only time will tell how effectively they can manage their supply chain. Although Walmart has a  strong history of adaptability, investors need to keep their eyes on how they navigate these choppy waters over the next few months.

Considering both companies had good earning reports. It’s interesting to see the pullback. 
I always look at the fourth quarter or December is the holy Grail for retailing.

The analyst in pundits all had comments as to why the pullback occurred. Walmart is the most intriguing since CEO Doug McMillan said that he basically did not raise prices in order to help the consumer.

They have not performed as well over the last 24 months as target has. Do you consider both of them a good buy?

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all managed to escape meme week with your portfolios intact! The name of the game this week is Retails Giants and Chinese Tech, and it’s here where we’ll find some of our most lucrative opportunities. Although it may not seem like it, some of the companies in these sectors have extremely large historical moves, meaning we’ve got the potential to make some serious dough. We’re also approaching holiday season, meaning that many retailers will give adjusted guidance on their calls in light of the supply chain issues that have been plaguing the globe, adding to the intensity of these already large moves. Let’s get into it!

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **The premiums on $NNOX are intoxicating.** Options are pricing around a 17% move at the time of writing, but historically $NNOX only moves 9%. Unfortunately for us, the sample size on this company is small, so we need to tread a little more carefully than usual. Regardless, the most $NNOX has ever moved post earnings is 18%, meaning even if we do get a “maximum” move, we won’t lose much money. I will likely opt to sell a 20/28 strangle once I conduct all little more research into the company later this week. I want to see if I can uncover any reasons regarding ***why*** the premiums are so high.

&nbsp;

- **$FL options will be extremely cheap come Friday.** Currently, the options are pricing an 8.3% move relative to the historical move of 9.3% , making them relatively efficient. Given that volatility doesn’t inflate throughout the week, these options should become extremely cheap by Friday since theta will murder the extrinsic value on them. Footlocker is no stranger to large moves, and if we can enter a lotto strangle for cheap Thursday before close, we could be looking at a handsome return come Friday morning. A straddle will currently run you $460, but by Friday this number may be closer to $300. If that’s the case, I’ll roll the dice on this one - I like my odds.

&nbsp;

- **Chinese tech give us an awesome collateral play opportunity!** $KWEB is a high liquidity ETF consisting of all of the Chinese tech stocks who report this week. If it behaves anything like American tech does during earnings week, there should be a clear directional move in the entire ETF. If we’re bullish or bearish on Chinese tech as a whole, we should look to go long or short on $KWEB instead of any of the individual tickers in order to mitigate our risks and generate significantly greater profits. For more information on this type of play, check out my in-depth writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would’ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don’t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn’t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It’s literally all just gambling, and as a result I’m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I’ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.

&nbsp;

- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we’re going up.

&nbsp;

- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you’re poor or want a binary directional play, I’d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we’re probably gonna do the classic “dump after earnings regardless of the outcome“ thing that everyone seems to get tricked by.

njhstj_WMT,WMT,e-commerce (Walmart),"# How Walmart’s Web Traffic data perfectly predicted their surprising quarterly reports.

American retail giant Walmart Inc. ([WMT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=WMT)) surprised all the financial analysts yesterday (May 18th), when they reported earnings. They blew away all estimates and posted impressive sales numbers. With E-commerce sales rising 37% year over year.

Upon release of the surprising reports, Walmart’s stock price rose significantly.

 So what if we could have known in advance, and predicted almost perfectly the growth in the retail giant’s E-commerce data? To answer this question we will dive into the company’s Web Traffic data.

# Web Traffic

When we surf the Internet, and access websites, our footprint remains both in the internal systems of the site, and in various tools and repositories, that collect this data. Web traffic is the number of visits to a site at a given time. The data can usually be seen in monthly / weekly / daily distribution and historical data can be examined (Some tools require payment, and some offer partial information for free).

Since Walmart’s E-Commerce business is based on visitors entering the company’s site, and purchasing products, we have hypothesized that the amount of web traffic to the site will predict and be somewhat correlated to its sales data from the product in question.

Using the [Semrush ](https://www.semrush.com/analytics/overview/?q=walmart.com&searchType=domain)Web Traffic tool, we examined and compared the web traffic data to the Walmart retail site in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2021.

In the first quarter of 2020, the web traffic to the site was: **January** — 202,217,552, **February** — 209,486,742, **March** — 215,756,823 for a **total of** 627,461,117.

In the first quarter of 2021, the web traffic to the site was: **January** — 283,487,106, **February** — 282,642,524, **March** — 278,975,827 for a **total of** 845,105,457.

This means that compared to the first quarter of 2020, when 627,461,117 people entered the Walmart site, 845,105,457 entered the site in the first quarter of 2021, **an increase of 35 percent!** (34,686).

As stated above, one of the major surprises in the reports released by Walmart is the **37 percent increase in e-commerce sales, a figure almost identical to the 35 percent increase in Web Traffic.**

Since Web traffic data is constantly updated, it was possible to access this data long before the reports were published, and predict the outcome with great accuracy.

This example shows the power of [Tradint](https://tradint.io/), and the ability of researchers to produce new research angles, capable of predicting companies’ performance based on unique data from around the Internet, and not just on the basis of economic data.

Hey Everyone. Hope you're all having a great day :)

I just wanted to get some thoughts on Walmart,  their share price has been up and down (mainly down since mid December) given everything that is going on; the lawsuit about the potential role in the opioid crisis, the tweet about Josh Hawley, 

However more recently, Walmart sold a majority share in ASDA (UK supermarket & retailer) for $6.8bn. Walmart are also awaiting the delivery of COVID vaccines as well as some other US pharmacies and retailers. Due to this, I have a suspicion that their share price will recover to what it was before the shenanigans of December last year, and then continue to grow.

Let me know your thoughts, I'm still learning and growing as a trader and investor so please feel free to critique my short DD here.

Cheers,

Henry

lbo85a_WMT,WMT,"Option Picks for 2/3 WMT,","**WMT**  
**Type of Play:** Earnings Ramp  
**Reasons:** Market should be green. Money should rotate back in before earnings. They have been killing it online, so some hype will be there.   
**Entry:** 141.5 with strong volume and momentum. Otherwise catch it low.   
**Option:** ITM 141 Strike  
Possible Target: 145. This area has tough resistance. If it breaks, I may size up for 149. 145 is a good place to take targets and wait for it to breakout. Possible head and shoulders pattern to form if it cannot.   


Buying 2 days after the dip/market rally, so a little late. But clear stop is previous high of day  and re-enter on recovery. Or a portfolio percentage risk. E.g. if your portfolio is 2000 and you risk 3%=60. I wouldn't recommend 3%. But for some people....eh. you get it.

It operates 11,300 stores in the US, which account for approx 76% of sales in fiscal 2019, with Mexico and Central America \~6%, the UK \~6%, and Canada \~4% beings  its largest external markets.

The company operates several e-commerce properties apart from its site, including Flipkart, Jet.com, and shoes.com (it also owns a roughly 10% stake in Chinese online retailer JD.com). As of 2019, e-commerce accounted for only \~5% of fiscal 2019 sales. However the e-sales growth during the pandemic has greatly increased this.

Walmart has been smart with its acquisitions and partnerships. Walmart has partnerships with Instacard, ThredUp, Shopify, and even Google. The Instacart partnership, together accounts for [nearly half](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png) of all online grocery sales. The partnership with Thredup allows Walmart to sell cheaper clothes on its online marketplace, and Shopify allows 3rd party sellers to sell their goods on Walmart's marketplace as well. Lastly, the Google partnership provides customers voice-enabled grocery shopping and likely much more in the future. Walmart's partnerships and acquisitions are taken to further complete with and provide a market alternative to Amazon.

If you want to see more of their partnership/acquisitions [please look here on page 2.](https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2019/annual/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf)

**Strengths:**

>\- Walmart is the largest retailer in the world providing it unequaled power to leverage their vendor's, suppliers, and manufacturers, keeping prices low with national and private brands.  
>  
>\- Walmart's cost advantage provides significant barrier to entry and is consistently used to disrupt their competitors.  
>  
>\- The company is aggressively investing in its e-commerce segment and focused on strategic acquisitions to complete with Amazon. (Mentioned in the last paragraph above)  
>  
>\-  The partnership with Google is has the potential to be particularly strong due to Walmart lacking strong tech exposure.  
>  
>\- Walmart PLUS memberships, 2 hour delivery, and expansion into drone delivery services.

**Risks:**

>\-  Walmart employs millions people and is facing intense pressure to raise wages. This will have an effect on their profit margins.  
>  
>\- Amazon. Amazon is much much more than just e-commerce.  
>  
>\- Walmart's profit margins aren't as wide as they could be due to keeping prices lower, this does bring them more sales revenue, but they have to be very wary of any competitors lowering their prices further to undermine Walmart's position and margins.

Amazon's threat to many of the traditional brick and mortar industries cannot be understated. Amazon's model is nearly the example of a monopsony, the opposite of a monopoly. They aren't interested in dominating one sector, but ingraining themselves into literally everything. This is why Amazon's model is so disruptive.

In addition to this, Amazon is often the company that raises the conversation of wage increases to undermine it's competitors. The [wage increase to 15$](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181002005317/en/Amazon-Raises-Minimum-Wage-to-15-for-All-U.S.-Employees-Including-Full-Time-Part-Time-Temporary-and-Seasonal) was much more than them ""listening to their critics"", it was a move to further pressure any of their competitors whose margins cannot effectively absorb this cost burden. This tactic, along with Walmarts cheap pricing tactics, is what allows Amazon to nab up companies very cheap.

# Financial History:

For Walmart we will be looking at the 5 year financials rather than the 10 year due to their push more recently to get into the ecommerce markets.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|$478,615|$33,559|$49,994|\~1.5|
|2017|$481,371|$32,884|$45,930|\~1.4|
|2018|$495,761|$30,966|$46,470|\~1.5|
|2019|$514,405|$32,635|$58,033|\~1.8|
|2020|$523,964|$31,555|$72,400|\~2.3|

The revenue is honestly just insane and shows how large Walmart is, plus it is something like 80-90% of the US population lives within 15 miles of a Walmart or something? Anyways, $478 Billion to $523 Billion, about an average increase of 2.2% YoY. Not bad, they are continuing to grow, but just ahead of currently inflation rates. When we look at EBITDA though, their margins are shrinking/lumpy.  This, based on the company movement, and from what they say in their 10K, this decrease is largely attributed to them moving into e-commerce. These numbers may be significantly different next year since their ecommerce has been growing pretty significantly during the pandemic, [they are estimated at 97% annual growth there](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-ecommerce-sales-reach-sky-high-growth-in-recent-quarter-2020-8). However note that ecommerce, despite this increase is still a very small piece of the company right now, it is going to take awhile for it to have a more significant impact, but the growth is absolutely there.

The debt is increasing due to acquisitions as well as investment into the ecommerce segment as well. The 2.3x debt/earnings is a bit higher than their historic levels, but again, they are investing right now, and it is still lower than a 3x where it starts to be a bit more concerning.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|$28,337|$10,051|$16,840|
|2019|$27,753|$10,344|$29,444|
|2020|$25,255|$10,705|$13,479|

Cash flow from operations is definitely in line with the decreasing EBITDA so that makes sense. Their CAPEX been consistent the last few years, nothing to really note there since the e-market stuff has already been mentioned. Now for the Free Cash Flow, in 2019 there is a significant jump, this is because in 2019 they took on \~$12 Billion in debt load, this was added to the FCF/E for whatever reason, we can subtract it and say that is was more likely \~$15/16/17 Billion, which is in line with the decline. In 2018 and 2020 they were making debt payments, appears to be about 1.5 Billion for each of those years, hence the lower FCF/E there.

Over the years, in addition to the dividend, they do appear to be using some of their capital to buy back shares, those have decreased from approx 3,200 - 2,850 outstanding over the last 5 years or so. Some would say this is the better way to give back to the shareholders rather than dividends, but others say that it is a way for companies to create synthetic earnings. Take what you will from that. Typically healthy (large) companies will do both dividends and share buybacks, so take what you will from that.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

Walmart (WMT) is a Dividend Aristocrat that has paid and increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$151.60|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|21.89|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.16|
|Yield|1.42% (Based on  $151.60 Price Nov 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|7.2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|1.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|34.45%|

Strictly from a Dividend Growth perspective, the payout is a bit low and the dividend growth has sharply decreased as the company continues to focus on e-market expansion. In addition to this, the yield on cost is of lower value right now, had the stock been purchased earlier when it's price was closer to 100$, it would have been an excellent buy, at the current price and yield though, there are better prospects.

From a value perspective... well Walmart over the years has traded closer to an 8x multiple, it is currently over 20x. Based on this alone it would be considered overvalued based on its financials, however one also needs to consider that higher multiples are typically paid for companies with stronger growth prospects...which leads us to growth.

From a growth perspective, Walmart is a market titan, the growth will be gradual over longer periods of time, but there are many factors that need to be considered from this perspective (as well as the others):

>\- Will their e-market investments pay off or will they lose market share due to more competitors in the business and pressure from Amazon?  
>  
>\- Will the decline of brick and mortar stores offset the earnings from the e-market?  
>  
>\- How much could they expand their margins by automating warehouses amoung other segments?  
>  
>\- Do their traditional brick and mortar stores provide Walmart a significant distribution advantage over Amazon? (80-90% of Americans within 15 miles of a Walmart mentioned above)  
>  
>\- How will Wamart continue to nurture their relationships with Google and Microsoft and will it continue to make smart and strategic acquisitions?  
>  
>\- How will future government policies and labor unions affect both Amazon and Walmart?

There are so many different unknowns that need to be considered.

# Closing Thoughts:

Walmart is an absolute titan of a company that is transitioning to have a significant e-market presence. Compared to Amazon, Walmart is currently the underdog that still needs to be very cognizant of it's other competitors, like Target. However, their recent partnerships and acquisitions have enabled the company to expand significantly online during the pandemic, and unlike Amazon, they have a wider physicals presence, stores that can act as distribution centers amoung other things.

Ultimately, Amazon is very likely to continue to dominate, however, Walmart does have the potential to start edging their way into the different market segments and start taking pieces of the pie for itself. Amazon is certainly aware of this, hence the reason it pushes timely wage-increases and other policies to undermine its competitors. Government policy is a significant factor to both due to their sheer size and presence.

At the end of it all, you need to ask yourself, do you think Walmart can continue compete, and continue to work its current business model? Or perhaps you'd take more the side of why not both?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views, read up on Target and Amazon. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!",2020-11-28,52,8

1. This annotation is where the anchored volume by price starts. This indicator starts here because this is the lowest point before the reversal and continuation of the trend higher.
2. This area shows two blue Raindrops forming before the next big move higher back in August. A blue Raindrop is a volume based doji and typically signals consolidation before the next move higher. As you can see, this same exact setup formed in late September.
3. This volume shelf is created by the anchored volume by price and shows quite a few shares holding at this level, creating a base for price to move up as supply dries up.

iw1y2d_ORCL,ORCL,Trump says he has agreed to deal in which TikTok will partner with Oracle and Walmart,"President Donald Trump said Saturday he has approved in principle a deal in which [Oracle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=ORCL) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) would partner with the viral video-sharing app TikTok in the U.S., allowing the popular app to [avoid a shutdown](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/trump-to-block-us-downloads-of-tiktok-wechat-on-sunday-officials-tell-reuters.html).

“I have given the deal my blessing -- if they get it done that’s great, if they don’t that’s okay too,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn before departing for North Carolina . “I approved the deal in concept.”

Trump said the new company will likely be incorporated in Texas. 

Oracle, Walmart and Tiktok could not be immediately reached for comment. 

The outcome could boost Oracle’s position as a company that can handle challenging computing workloads and help to resolve a geopolitical dispute between the U.S. and China.

TikTok and Oracle [both said Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/oracle-confirms-deal-with-tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-become-trusted-technology-provider.html) that ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, had sent a proposal to the U.S. Treasury Department over the weekend. Reports throughout the week said that negotiations were bogged down on the precise details of the deal, including the ownership stakes of Oracle and ByteDance, and control of the recommendation algorithms TikTok uses to promote particular material. 

Oracle CEO Safra Catz was a member of President Trump’s transition team, and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison threw a fundraising event for Trump earlier this year.

Oracle already provides cloud infrastructure to online video services [8x8](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=EGHT) and [Zoom](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=ZM), among other clients, although [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN), Microsoft and other companies picked up more cloud revenue than Oracle in 2019, according to [estimates](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-10-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-37-point-3-percent-in-2019) from industry research company [Gartner](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=IT).

[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT) had sought to acquire TikTok’s operations in the U.S. Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) as a partner, but on Sunday said [ByteDance had decided not to do that deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/microsoft-bid-for-tiktoks-us-operations-rejected-by-bytedance.html).

China and the Trump administration have used tariffs in their trade war in recent years, and their disagreements have spilled over into the technology industry. The Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States [pushed for a sale](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/grindrs-chinese-owner-says-to-sell-social-media-app-for-608-million.html) of dating app Grindr by the Chinese company that bought it in 2016, and the committee later [looked into ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/mnuchin-confirms-tiktok-is-under-cfius-review.html) of Musical.ly, a video sharing app that ByteDance merged with TikTok in 2018, because of national security concerns. A Trump executive order in August in August sought to [block U.S. transactions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/trump-issues-executive-orders-to-ban-us-transactions-with-wechat-tiktok.html) with ByteDance, as well as [Tencent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=700-HK), which owns messaging app WeChat.

President Trump had taken steps to [ban TikTok in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/trump-says-he-will-ban-tiktok-through-executive-action-as-soon-as-saturday.html) or make ByteDance [sell the app’s U.S. assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/president-trump-orders-bytedance-to-divest-from-its-us-tiktok-business-within-90-days.html). The Chinese government subsequently revised export restrictions so that they now cover “recommendation of personalized information services based on data analysis,” among other things. TikTok’s app draws on recommendation systems to select videos to show each user.

That said, we think that there is little incremental today vs. what the stock has been embedding after the initial run up in July, and the near-term direction of the stock will depend on comps and relative traffic trends due to the impact from unique COVID-related factors as detailed a couple weeks ago.""

""Ultimately, the main value in the offering seems to be the speed of home delivery... Missing from this program is free shipping (next day/two day) with no threshold on the broader and growing online assortment, a key value of Prime and a feature that ranked high in our survey (number two, right behind free same day grocery).""

""In that context, one key factor will be breadth of general merchandise SKU’s available for this same day option, to make it competitive vs. Prime.""

**Jefferies:** ""We remain pos. on WMT's now official Walmart+ subscription offering as it helps tie together WMT's omni-channel efforts and is progress towards a legit ecosystem (TikTok would help) w/ a strong physical footprint that is increasingly competitive vs. AMZN. Today's announcement is largely in line with expectations, but we expect add'l benefits to come in the next few qtrs.

""We believe this is the right time for WMT to capitalize on accel'd ecomm demand by leveraging its incumbency in grocery and superior omnichannel capabilities to make progress towards establishing a legit ecosystem that a potential TikTok deal could make whole.""

""We view WMT's 4,700+ store network as a potential advantage over AMZN from a distribution perspective, esp. if WMT can leverage its footprint as 3P Marketplace vendors come onto the platform. While all of this may come at a cost to N/I-T earnings, we see this as the correct move if WMT is to create a true ecosystem that's able to compete w/ AMZN over the L-T, esp. as the online giant continues to push more and more into the physical world.""",2020-09-01,23,54

They’ll also rely on [gig-economy workers](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/04/walmarts-future-workforce-robots-and-freelancers/557063/) for logistics and fulfillment, which is the only hiccup. Oh, and Karens wanting to talk to the manager.

But I think that it’ll go for 140 at least, if not higher calls. Thoughts?",2020-08-18,36,46
ibj9s2_WMT,WMT,"Moves expected this week, WMT, TGT, BABA, NVDA etc.","As I do here each week, here's a look ahead of some of the moves expected out of notable earnings. 

My thoughts: It's interesting to see the much smaller expected moves of companies set to report this week (towards the end of earnings season) as opposed to what we saw a few weeks ago. That's probably reflective of two things, the first is that overall market volatility is much lower now (VIX \~22). And somewhat related, these company's expected moves are now isolating their own earnings as opposed to picking up the uncertainty of other companies and the overall market. More than 90% of the other companies have already reported, including many of their peers. This is probably as pure an earnings reaction move as we've seen since the Covid selloff.

Let me know in the comments if you'd like to see anything added.

**Last Week**

huvf18_WMT,WMT,Walmart (WMT) eCommerce growth: A Wolf on a Leash,"For this year, 2020, Walmart is set-up to do about 480 Billion in in-store sales, and 41 Billion in eCommerce sales.

*As of now, only 8% of Walmarts total sales are coming from the eCommerce channel.*

If you are an investor considering Walmart and properly are evaluating Walmarts eCommerce upside potential, then here’s one of the limiting thoughts you’ve probably had:

*""Even if I bet on Walmart, how much will a meteoric rise in eCommerce sales be weighed down by Walmart's established but ""boring"" brick and mortal sales? Stock value won't ever capitulate the way a tech company can with so much of it's market cap locked into the in-store sales where PE ratios are low""*

Looking at the growth scenarios laid out below, their in-store sales should not be as big of a negative 'gut-check' analysis would have you believe.

&#x200B;

If Walmart can execute the eCommerce growth story, then not only does Walmarts eCommerce have the potential to out-size all of it’s current total yearly in-stores sales within a decade, but also massive overweight expectations for it's Market-cap because analysts will be forced to re-evaluate the type of holding Walmart is entirely.

Walmart will not be ""defensive-retail"" when that shift begins to happen and it’s PE multiple will move accordingly.  If it's eCommerce deliveries on a successful growth story, it's value will justify a much higher multiple of it's earnings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So - w**hat are some potential out-comes for Walmarts eCommerce sales trajectory in the next few years?**

If Walmarts eCommerce division grows at an optimistic consistent 40% YoY increase, Walmarts eCommerce total gross sales will eclipse the sales of its current in-store business for this year in less than 8 years.

In-store Walmart sales this year are set to be 480 Billion\~

eCommerce 2020 set to be 41 Billion and grows to 432.40 Billion in 7 years..

8 years is a long time, but that is massive upside potential and growth.

&#x200B;

At a more conservative growth rate of only 25% YoY eCommerce sales, Walmarts eCommerce sales will eclipse its current in-store business for this year in less than 11 years.

Again, in-store Walmart sales this year are set to be 480 Billion\~

eCommerce 2020 set to be 41 Billion and grows to 477.30 Billion in 11 years, year 12 it’s 596.63 Billion.

Walmarts in-store business does not have the same growth potential as online.

In-store sales growth outpaces inflation slightly, but it’s subject to so many more head-winds, low-margin products, and lack of automation/efficiency innovation than eCommerce.

Assuming Walmart does not stop it’s eCommerce initiatives, there will at some point be an intersection point when Walmarts fast-growing eCommerce outweighs it’s in-store sales.. and given the scenarios above, it will be obvious to more people that this is happening in the next few years when that 8% of total sales continues to move higher and higher.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seeing the massive, utterly massive opportunity here for Walmart stakeholders on the table from the upside of 40%+ compounding eCommerce growth and the successful execution of a high margin online ecosystem of products – will Walmart be able to achieve that YoY exponential growth investors are so fond of, or will they let us down?

&#x200B;

Strategically speaking – it doesn’t take a genius to see that Walmart should be deploying all of its available resources into an eCommerce growth story when Amazon has already paid the innovation tax and proved the concept and scale which can be achieved.

Walmart, if it wants to deliver value for shareholders, should be using its massive existing infrastructure to facilitate and replicate everything Amazon has proven works and is profitable in its successful eCommerce ecosystem, and beyond that, it should be developing ahead of Amazon in areas that leverage “what only Walmart can do”, for the eCommerce customer, with their existing unique assets & systems.

&#x200B;

Not only is it very obvious that they should be pursuing this area of growth with full focus, it is painfully obvious that they should be doing it as quickly as possible, *because once consumers have gotten used to that Amazon prime-membership, they will be harder and more expensive to pull back to Walmarts ecosystem.*

While Walmart is uniquely positioned to overcome the value proposition there with media partnerships, and loss leader offers only it can provide from it's massive scale, it shouldn't be waiting.

&#x200B;

Walmart's management team is intelligent and risk-averse, that's how you get to Walmarts size, but the issue is that deferring these expensive and ""inefficient"" eCommerce investments and customer acquisition costs is that an eCommerce ecosystem will still be Walmarts absolutely biggest and best growth opportunity for the next couple decades…

Strategically speaking, they not saving anything by moving slow… in fact they are piles burning stakeholder money this way.

&#x200B;

Understanding the online opportunity Walmart has, Walmart should not be leaving anything off the table in related to its spending to grow it’s eCommerce user-base and ecosystem.

40%+ yearly eCommerce growth is achievable for Walmart… Amazon has done it during many years in it's growth between 2006-2019, before they had any of the customer recognition or infrastructure Walmart has today.

Also, Walmart will do 40%+ so this year, tracking for 44%+ growth for this year while they are sitting on un-invested cash and unambitious growth strategy…

This is the “idiot-proof” tail-wind Covid-world can provide, and which is why Walmart is a wolf.

&#x200B;

**What is holding Walmarts exponential eCommerce growth story back?**

The man in-charge of Walmarts eCommerce business is Marc Lore. Sort-of. He's in-charge but not fully in-charge.

In an effort to understand Walmarts likelyhood of delivering value in the coming years for investors, we need to understand how Marc is navigating Walmart through it’s eCommerce strategy, and how well that area is moving ahead.

Marc's history is beyond the scope of this DD post, but he’s certainly proven himself extremely capable before hopping on-board as a Walmart executive with multiple big eCommerce growth stories and successes under his belt.

One of those successes, was his business Jet.com, which Walmart purchased for 3.3 Billion in 2016, and as part of sale conditions also acquired Marc who would take the helm and position Walmart for eCommerce growth for 5 years, maybe more.

He was hired onto Walmart through that acquisition, and if we look at 2016 until now, Walmart has made progress with him around. Much of the traction we are seeing now for Walmart in their eCommerce initiatives has been a result of folding Jet.com’s team into pushing Walmart ahead.

&#x200B;

Despite the progress he has made for Walmart, we really need to figure out how he stacks up to the competition, and this sit down with Marc and Recode’s Jason Del Rey is basically a psychological window into the suffering soul of a man that should be leading Walmart to rapid exponential growth, but seems hindered in his ability by Walmart corporate leadership to act decisively, ""inefficiently"" (but as is necessary for blitzscaling eCommerce growth), and comprehensively.

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4f6Fg78Jx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4f6Fg78Jx4)

Points of note:

About 18 minutes in-

Marc’s early strategy was to grow with major acquisitions / partnerships to fill out WMT’s online portfolio.

Seems WMT executives have blocked these and are having him develop in-house incubated projects (Slow)

About 25:30 minutes in-

He’s clearly discouraged with how many approvals he needs and projects he can push forward… executives are not allowing him to push at the speed he wants to innovate with.

&#x200B;

General impressions –

You're welcome to watch it yourself, make your own impressions, but it certainly seems like, in contrast to Amazon, where 12 exciting, high-margin and complimentary innovations are all taking place with full force on the same time horizon, Walmart leadership is afraid of burn-rate, afraid of anything “wasteful” and are not correctly evaluating the massive return on capital they could achieve with aggressive eCommerce spending.

The environment seems too cautious for this guy to do his thing and make stakeholders money. The philosophy of those above him is not showing any indications they see the true merit in blitzscaling Walmarts eCommerce or that they are properly evaluating the upside potential compared to the in-store, which is strange, because Amazon is proof of concept and has shown that if they get customers online they will get better margins. Digital products take no money to deliver and are wildly profitable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As a narrative of Walmarts online growth story, I can’t think of anything more unpleasant than:

“Entrepreneurial maverick with a track record of home-runs Marc Lore unable to make decisive, timely, and massively profitable decisions which can double Walmart’s size and operating margin in 10 years due to resistance from the committee of “the-old-guard” leadership”.

Internally, it seems off-base that Walmart continues to pay dividends to shareholders and is recording that 15 Billion on the balance sheet as profit, instead of re-investing it in online growth, as though that decision is ""helping it's stakeholders get value"".

Walmart should be deploying capital with less focus on ""efficiency"" and more focus on growth, allocating much more of it for guys like Marc to deploy and execute what Amazon has proven works.

I can't think of any possible valid analysis that would indicate that Walmart's best growth opportunity for the next 20 years is anything other than an eCommerce ecosystem... and the longer they defer the investment the more expensive it will be to pull the marketshare back from other platforms like Amazon.

&#x200B;

For the Walmart investor here what is scary is that Marc, (or whoever fills his shoes eventually) seems to be viewed as a minor part of Walmarts story.

""The-old-guard"" of decision makers don't yet seem to want to grant the power and decision making authority the CEO of that division should wield considering how the execution there is the going to move Walmart billions of dollars up or down, and psychologically speaking that makes sense.

""He's only running 8% of the business"" is probably an easy misconception to make as a Walmart executive.

&#x200B;

Marc has laid some very positive groundwork on some very positive things for Walmart, but until that philosophy changes, Walmart will be it's own worst enemy to share-holder value.

The competitive landscape is with them, Covid-19 is with them, consumer shopping habits are with them... they are holding themselves back.

&#x200B;

Despite this somewhat critical analysis on Walmarts comprehension of it's future - I don't want to be overly harsh on them or on Walmarts prospects.

&#x200B;

Risk averse executives who calculate, focus on margin and avoid mis-steps at all costs is how Walmart got it's crown and massive size to begin with.

In the end, this year is a 40+% growth for it's eCommerce sales.

Perhaps they will under-invest, under-perform internally with restrictions on Mavericks like Marc who can move the needle for them, and yet still slowly adjust and re-prioritize their focus and capital allocation over the next few years.

&#x200B;

Maybe a more optimistic outlook is that – Walmarts eCommerce potential can (and probably still will) over deliver on expectations even with executive management guiding Walmart away from its best use of capital with their old school philosophy.

A rising eCommerce tide will deliver for the incumbents with buying power and established logistics, especially when you've got the customer trust already in-place.",2020-07-20,42,35

htk6fy_WMT,WMT,Why I am so bullish on Walmart (WMT),"**Walmart has recently announced it's subscription service to compete with Amazon prime called Walmart+**

Walmart+ aims to provide: **same-day delivery,** discounts on fuel, and early access to Walmart deals.

Not to mention, the cost of their subscription is annually cheaper than Amazon's Prime.

Now, Amazon has been dominating the online retail space up to this point solely because of Prime 2-day shipping.

**See, people pay for convenience.**

**We're living in a society that wants everything on demand.**

To Amazon, this is no secret.

Amazon currently has 175 fulfillment centers around the world and 75 are located in North America.

However, it will not be long before Walmart's same-day delivery makes Amazon Prime look like snail mail.

***Here's why:***

**Walmart's traditional brick and mortar locations all have the potential to become fulfillment centers.**

Walmart has recently partnered with the eCommerce giant Shopify in an attempt to compete with amazon's monopoly in the online retail space.

**Walmart has over 4,000 potential fulfillment centers.**

That's over 20x as many fulfillment centers as amazon!

**Walmart also claims to have locations within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population.**

Because Walmart is so close to 90% of the population, 60 minute delivery times are not farfetched.

60-minute delivery will effectively conquer the online retail space and render Amazon Prime 2-day shipping, snail mail.

**In time-sensitive/last-minute situations, Walmart's same-day delivery is practical.**

In real life, something always happens.

When it does, Walmart's same-day delivery's got our back.

**Walmart is also entering health care.**

Walmart not only aims to help people *save money* with their low prices on everyday items, but they're also preparing to help people *live better* by stepping into the health care industry.",2020-07-18,76,138

Today’s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It’s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP’s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP’s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight’s video about the S&P is very telling, I think, with the S&P only 2% off its high, the median S&P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.

Tonight’s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI

Our Discord Forum link is on the video description..

SECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off “10’2 of thousands of employees.”  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it’s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don’t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We’ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP’s to the averages.  I don’t think it’s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.

And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close – only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 – 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.

Today’s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It’s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP’s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP’s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight’s video about the S&P is very telling, I think, with the S&P only 2% off its high, the median S&P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.
 
We sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60’s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today’s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.

Our Discord Forum link is on the video description..

SECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off “10’2 of thousands of employees.”  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it’s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don’t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We’ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP’s to the averages.  I don’t think it’s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.

Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off “10’2 of thousands of employees.”  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it’s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don’t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We’ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP’s to the averages.  I don’t think it’s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.

OIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night’s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night’s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).
 
 
GOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said “we’ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.”  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close – only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 – 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.

Today’s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It’s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP’s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP’s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight’s video about the S&P is very telling, I think, with the S&P only 2% off its high, the median S&P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.
 
We sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60’s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today’s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.

OIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night’s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night’s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).
 
 
GOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said “we’ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.”  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close – only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 – 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.

Today’s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It’s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP’s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP’s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight’s video about the S&P is very telling, I think, with the S&P only 2% off its high, the median S&P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.
 
We sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60’s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today’s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.

SECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off “10’2 of thousands of employees.”  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it’s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don’t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We’ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP’s to the averages.  I don’t think it’s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.

ha7mvn_WMT,WMT,"$WMT, $TGT, $HD, $LOW, $BBY - 5 interesting trends in retail sales","According to analyst checks at Credit Suisse, retail sales continued to improve through May (-7.7% y/y vs. -19.5% in Apr) reflecting the benefits from stimulus, as well as higher consumer savings in Apr.

As expected, the weakest areas were Food Service/Drinking Places (-39% y/y) and Department Stores/Specialty Retail that were closed. For this improving momentum to continue, either the job picture needs to meaningfully improve, and/or more stimulus will be needed.

CS outlined 5 interesting trends:

1) Non-store channel continued to accelerate even as stores reopened, with the 2nd largest y/y dollar increase on record (only second to Dec 2019, a peak online holiday period). Non-store retailers’ sales were +25.3% vs. 22.5% in Apr.

2) Home related spending accelerated and continued to gain wallet share. Home improvement was +140 bps for wallet share, and +80 bps including furnishings and electronics. Positive read to $HD, $LOW, and $BBY.

3) Everything Auto-related improved, with Motor Vehicles -7% vs -34% last month, and Auto Parts stores +1% May vs -15% in April. Gas Station sales were -31.5% vs -39.0% in April, but importantly, if adjusted for lower gas prices (-35% y/y in May vs. -34% in April), it points to a positive inflection in volume trends.

4) Sporting goods saw the biggest sequential improvement, accelerating back to pre COVID levels, +6% in May vs. -44% in April.

5) Market share shifting from Clothing/Accessory/Department Stores to Mass Merchants such as $TGT and $WMT.",2020-06-16,17,12

However, assuming this crazy market is consistent of being crazy, Target was down all day today and ended in the red. The question is will Target, which stayed more open than even wal-mart during the pandemic earlier on, be able to beat expectations and gain?? (while also hopefully having some form of guidance because that's been killin winning stocks lately.)

It's very hard to gauge at the moment, internal stores I've been to, and sales talk seem to indicate Target has done well, but it hasn't had the same run up or cofidence from investors as Walmart or even Home Depot, both of which didn't gain as expected, though Home Depot at least made some sense, while Walmart was a wtf moment.

Another variable to consider is Target extending their extra $2 an hour for their workers which may have caused some issues in financing or may have been a drop of water in a bucket, but until the morning we will have no way of knowing.

This seems to be a risky play, but considering what happened to Walmart, I will yolo based on the belief that the crazy market will skyrocket Target. I will find a way to figure out this upside down market, if even it's impossible!.

The gains started when the company announced that it started shipping AI based thermal imaging technology to customers in the United States and Japan about two weeks ago. Recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), but there’s much more to this than Walmart. [article](https://alphastocknews.com/remark-holdings-mark-stock-theres-more-to-it-than-walmart/3352/)

DD done by “Informed Observer”

MARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK’s intrinsic value.

MARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK’s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.

The resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.

The Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company’s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK’s auditor has not resigned and the Company’s past audits have been qualified with “going concern” risk language, so at this point the auditor’s opinion letter can’t get much worse….unless they refuse to provide an opinion…which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.

As we get closer to MARK’s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28….market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company’s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company’s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization’s credibility.

MARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company’s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company’s rare and effective official statement of April 30.

It is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK’s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK’s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK’s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).

The value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG’s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK’s current share price.

Unfortunately this will also get rid of a key backup job for most of us here on WSB. 

Edit: There appears to be some confusion on the morality of this tactic on the part of $WMT. I would remind anyone who thinks Walmart is acting immorally that public corporations have an ethical and legal fiduciary duty to act on the part of their shareholders to maximize profits. Changing the job requirements to push out the mentally and physically disabled was the only thing to do in this instance. Some of you have also mentioned that these employees are subsidized. In a purely capitalist world employment subsidies wouldn't exist. $WMT is doing the right thing. ",2019-02-26,5656,607

6v2y8f_WMT,WMT,Don't invest in $AMZN or $WMT,"Its pretty simple.

Those two giants will be in a bloodbath war for the next 5 years.

Both will sacrifice margins and profits to steal share from each other. Problem is consumer spending is not growing or in some cases declining.  I don't see either of these stocks out performing the market.  You are better off throwing your money into an ETF.

1. WMT will be hurt because of declining margins. Yes they will be able to grow online sales. But at the cost of profits. That will not help the stock price. In 5 years I see WMT's revenue up only about 10% but margins down just as much or more.

2. AMZN will be hurt because WMT will be stealing some of their growth. I'm not saying WMT will steal current AMZN customers.  I'm saying WMT will capture a ton of consumers who are not prime members. AMZN is expected to grow revenues at 20% for the next couple years. I don't see that happening as WMT becomes stronger with online sales.

3. Direct to customer sales.  I think we will see more and more suppliers sell directly to customers in the future.  Both Amazon and Walmart will try to squeeze suppliers to the limit to preserve their margins while competing on price.  I think many suppliers will decide to sell direct to customers. The technology is ready for this type of change.  With TouchID, Apple Pay, and other digital token services, its easier than ever to buy stuff online without creating an account or filling out an entire 30 field form.  With TouchID and Shopify you literally just need your fingerprint and maybe a 4 digit pin to buy items at a merchant website instantly.  No more filing out huge forms or entering credit card information.  The 1-click advantage and convience of Amazon is getting eroded.

Disclosure:  I do not own WMT or AMZN, except in S&P500 ETF's.  I do own Shopify shares.  I am also a Prime Member for 5+ years.

# What do they do?

## The fluffy stuff:

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. operates through three segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. 

* The Walmart U.S. segment (64% of sales, $308bn) includes its mass merchant concept in the United States operating under the Walmart or Wal-Mart brands, as well as digital retail. 
* The Walmart International segment (24% of sales, $116bn) includes various formats divided into three categories: retail, wholesale and other across 27 countries. These categories consist of various formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, and warehouse clubs, such as Sam's Clubs, cash and carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. 
* The Sam's Club segment (12% of sales, 57bn) includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States, as well as samsclub.com. It's a sort of Costco, I think.

The sheer size of the business is awesome, with 260m people visiting Wal-mart each week. On top of that, read the latest [investor presentation](https://cdn.corporate.walmart.com/cd/2d/dcfd057e400694c88e13754462c6/boa-presentation-final.pdf) and you'll be inspired by their drive and ethic.

## The number crunch:

The topline's not showing a lot of oompf. If they get a 1% growth, it's good. Sure a strong dollar doesn't help, but it's hard to see where the growth comes from. And if the topline isn't growth, it's not a surprise that EPS isn't rising.

|Jan year end|2017A|2017A|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $486bn | $482bn | $486bn | $476bn | $469bn|
|EPS | $4.38 | $4.57 | $4.99 | $4.85 | $5.01|

Now the business isn't ex-growth, and they are still able to build out new stores, with the US growing to 4,700 today from 4,000 five years ago and overall, inc. international & Sam's Clubs growing to 11,700 stores from 10,400 five years ago. But this tells several stories

* International is over 50% of the stores but less than 25% of the sales
* That revenues per store isn't rising in a meaningful way.

## Shareholders get?

Well, divides of course! The forecast dividend of $2.07 compares to a forecast EPS of $4.32. Which is a marginal improvement on last year. 

Though on top of this, they did buyback $8bn last year at an average price of $69 a share. And still have a substantial authorization remaining. 

As for debtholders v shareholders: the market value is $233bn and there's under $40bn of net debt. Net debt is a manageable 1.2x operating profit, so nothing concerning on the balance sheet side.

# How do they compare?

## Versus the competition

There's competition everywhere, and when you are the biggest player on the market, the law of large numbers works two ways: (a) scale = better margin (b) little room for growth / everyone's after your turf.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Wal-Mart Stores Inc | $485,873M | 7% | 17%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $142,573M | 9% | 14%
Home Depot Inc | $94,595M | 16% | 149%
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc | $116,081M | 7% | 14%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $121,194M | 4% | 20%
Target Corporation | $69,496M | 10% | 22%
Dollar General Corp. | $21,987M | 11% | 23%
Kroger Co | $115,337M | 5% | 29%

There are a rake of players with better margins and higher returns, so admirable as WMT is, perhaps there's a better alternative.

## You price sensitive? 

It's hardly pricey at 18x forecast earnings, relative to the peer group, though remember, WMT has traded as low as 13 times forecast earnings in the last 2 years. That sort of multiple expansion, with no earnings upgrades puzzles me.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
WMT | $232,581M | 18x | 5% | 3% | 13%
AMZN.O | $455,425M | 142x | 22% | 0% | 2%
HD | $189,400M | 22x | 12% | 2% | 7%
WBA.O | $92,940M | 17x | 14% | 2% | 8%
COST.O | $75,796M | 31x | 10% | 1% | 6%
TGT | $32,037M | 15x | 2% | 4% | 19%
DG | $20,257M | 17x | 7% | 1% | 9%
KR | $26,559M | 13x | 6% | 2% | 17%

Perhaps the hardest circle-squaring is WMT v AMZN. Sure the long term growth forecast is 5% v 22%, but guess how many years it would take for them to be on the same valuation? *14 years*! 

To me, the valuation / growth mix looks nicer for $HD and $KR.

# What do people think of WMT?

## Wall Street says:

The professionals on Wall Street have a $75.01 for WMT which is 2% below the current price, so no wonder their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. In fact they've hardly moved their target price or recommendation for 6 months, even though the stock's up 10-15%.

## Overall sentiment?

Wall Street's not changed it's view in 3/6 months, nor have them moved their forecasts...but the stocks ramped... so sentiment has clearly improved towards WMT. 

# Well?

Bringing it all together, I'm going to pass on this. 

Solid as the business and management are, growth is hard to come by, and after 25 years work outside the US, they still haven't replicated the success internationally. The market's ramped the valuation, despite no fundamental improvement in the underlying business. And I can't see any catalyst to drive valuation or earnings higher.

* The Walmart International segment (24% of sales, $116bn) includes various formats divided into three categories: retail, wholesale and other across 27 countries. These categories consist of various formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, and warehouse clubs, such as Sam's Clubs, cash and carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. 
* The Sam's Club segment (12% of sales, 57bn) includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States, as well as samsclub.com. It's a sort of Costco, I think.

The sheer size of the business is awesome, with 260m people visiting Wal-mart each week. On top of that, read the latest [investor presentation](https://cdn.corporate.walmart.com/cd/2d/dcfd057e400694c88e13754462c6/boa-presentation-final.pdf) and you'll be inspired by their drive and ethic.

## The number crunch:

The topline's not showing a lot of oompf. If they get a 1% growth, it's good. Sure a strong dollar doesn't help, but it's hard to see where the growth comes from. And if the topline isn't growth, it's not a surprise that EPS isn't rising.

|Jan year end|2017A|2017A|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $486bn | $482bn | $486bn | $476bn | $469bn|
|EPS | $4.38 | $4.57 | $4.99 | $4.85 | $5.01|

Now the business isn't ex-growth, and they are still able to build out new stores, with the US growing to 4,700 today from 4,000 five years ago and overall, inc. international & Sam's Clubs growing to 11,700 stores from 10,400 five years ago. But this tells several stories

* International is over 50% of the stores but less than 25% of the sales
* That revenues per store isn't rising in a meaningful way.

## Shareholders get?

Well, divides of course! The forecast dividend of $2.07 compares to a forecast EPS of $4.32. Which is a marginal improvement on last year. 

Though on top of this, they did buyback $8bn last year at an average price of $69 a share. And still have a substantial authorization remaining. 

As for debtholders v shareholders: the market value is $233bn and there's under $40bn of net debt. Net debt is a manageable 1.2x operating profit, so nothing concerning on the balance sheet side.

# How do they compare?

## Versus the competition

There's competition everywhere, and when you are the biggest player on the market, the law of large numbers works two ways: (a) scale = better margin (b) little room for growth / everyone's after your turf.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Wal-Mart Stores Inc | $485,873M | 7% | 17%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $142,573M | 9% | 14%
Home Depot Inc | $94,595M | 16% | 149%
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc | $116,081M | 7% | 14%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $121,194M | 4% | 20%
Target Corporation | $69,496M | 10% | 22%
Dollar General Corp. | $21,987M | 11% | 23%
Kroger Co | $115,337M | 5% | 29%

There are a rake of players with better margins and higher returns, so admirable as WMT is, perhaps there's a better alternative.

## You price sensitive? 

It's hardly pricey at 18x forecast earnings, relative to the peer group, though remember, WMT has traded as low as 13 times forecast earnings in the last 2 years. That sort of multiple expansion, with no earnings upgrades puzzles me.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
WMT | $232,581M | 18x | 5% | 3% | 13%
AMZN.O | $455,425M | 142x | 22% | 0% | 2%
HD | $189,400M | 22x | 12% | 2% | 7%
WBA.O | $92,940M | 17x | 14% | 2% | 8%
COST.O | $75,796M | 31x | 10% | 1% | 6%
TGT | $32,037M | 15x | 2% | 4% | 19%
DG | $20,257M | 17x | 7% | 1% | 9%
KR | $26,559M | 13x | 6% | 2% | 17%

Perhaps the hardest circle-squaring is WMT v AMZN. Sure the long term growth forecast is 5% v 22%, but guess how many years it would take for them to be on the same valuation? *14 years*! 

To me, the valuation / growth mix looks nicer for $HD and $KR.

# What do people think of WMT?

## Wall Street says:

The professionals on Wall Street have a $75.01 for WMT which is 2% below the current price, so no wonder their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. In fact they've hardly moved their target price or recommendation for 6 months, even though the stock's up 10-15%.

## Overall sentiment?

Wall Street's not changed it's view in 3/6 months, nor have them moved their forecasts...but the stocks ramped... so sentiment has clearly improved towards WMT. 

# Well?

Bringing it all together, I'm going to pass on this. 

Solid as the business and management are, growth is hard to come by, and after 25 years work outside the US, they still haven't replicated the success internationally. The market's ramped the valuation, despite no fundamental improvement in the underlying business. And I can't see any catalyst to drive valuation or earnings higher.

62erfq_WMT,WMT,Mixed Medium-Term Outlook for Wal-Mart (WMT),"On March 29, 2017 Wal-Mart  crossed above its 200 day moving average (MA). Historically this has occurred 192 times. When this happens, the stock does not always continue to rise. It has a median gain of 3.407% and maximum gain of 36.667% over the next 15 trading days. 

When we take a look at other technical indicators, the relative strength index ( RSI ) is at 58.1906. RSI tends to determine overbought and oversold levels. I personally use anything above 75 as overbought and anything under 25 as oversold. The current reading declares the stock is neutral and looking for direction but slightly moving up at the moment. 

The true strength index ( TSI ) is currently 7.9533. The TSI determines overbought/oversold levels and/or current trend. I solely use this as an indicator of trend as overbought and oversold levels vary. The TSI is double smoothed in its calculation and is a great indicator of upward and downward movement. The current reading declares the stock is up. Even though it is still a positive number, it is trending downward. 

The positive vortex indicator (VI) is currently 1.000 and just crossed over the negative indicator. The VI determines current trend and direction. When the positive level is higher than 1 and higher than the negative indicator, the overall price action is moving upward. When the negative level is higher than 1 and higher than the positive indicator, the overall price action is moving downward. The current reading declares the stock is trending upward....

5y2mgq_WMT,WMT,"When will WMT, TGT, COST, ect Fight back against Amazon?","I mean seriously. Will these retailers just keep their heads in the sand and allow Amazon to steal their lunch, dinner, and breakfast?

The strategy is simple. Come close to matching Amazon's online experience and trump them with your physical stores. The combination of an strong online platform AND physicals stores is the key.

Sure Walmart and Costco have decent online store fronts. But what makes Amazon better boils down to one thing: selection. Costco, Walmart, ect can match Amazon on price. But they have limited selection. So how to solve the problem?

Walmart, Costco, Target, Home Depot, ect all need to combine forces to battle Amazon. Imagine if there was ONE website you could login to. With ONE credit card and ONE account. From that site you can order stuff from Costco, Target, Home Depot, Walmart, ect. The selection available would blow away Amazon. Shipping and fulfillment would blow away Amazon because combined those retailers have a much bigger reach.

Will they do it?  The problem is PRIDE. Walmart, Costco, ect think they can do it on their own and they want to own the customer data/relationship online. But they are making a stupid mistake. Only by combining their inventories, physical stores, and distribution network can they compete with Amazon long-term.",2017-03-07,0,29

Their P/B ratio is near an all-time low at approximately 3. They have a pretty strong economic moat by being an international company, selling many products at a discount price with a high turnover rate. Though they’ve almost saturated the US market, they still have a lot of potential outside the US (note their recent growth in Canada and Mexico). They’re also investing heavily in e-commerce, which is growing and can actually bring in a lot of revenue in developing countries. Though they’ve seen little revenue growth over the past 5 years, and their stock price is significantly larger than their intrinsic value, I think it may be worth a long term investment seeing how they’re slightly on the cheaper end at the moment.
