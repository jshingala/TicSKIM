1jmmu1x_XLE,XLE,Was not looking at my options on the energy XLE ETF.  I just did. +85%.  This seems too easy.,"Once the market collapses, energy seems like a safe place. And Trump is looking for war. Any war. Anywhere. It gives old men a testosterone boast. So thought it was a no-brainer.


War comes, I'm on a beach in Oaxaca. Surfs up. Past the draft age. But boys being boys. They love this war stuff. Sometimes these options change price at 2 AM EST. I'm not sure why that happens. 

Yoy may want to check them out.

13vv8hg_XOM,XOM,XLE remains my top pick,"The market overall seems about to ""long squeeze""; too many people buying FOMO into too few stocks, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA in particular. All are at absurd valuations, and by themselves in the race to 2021 All time highs.

The tell is that money is flooding back into bonds (while it was draining last week). Money coming out of liquidity into some good price squeezes will go back into liquidity to find better deals with the profits made off the blow-off-tops.

I think that will be XLE which I view as representing XOM, CVX and OXY if  you're into single stock plays, is at a great valuation.

Oil continues to play the bear-speculation game while the physical oil market is too tight, OPEC+ cuts are too threatening (June 4th); the oil majors are still both cash heavy and cash flow positive leading to great dividend yields and stock buy backs.

Many people suspect a recession but the actual refineries don't tell the same story. They are at 90% capacity and they are draining storage across the world. The world is also ""flush"" with oil which is an unusual combination.

My explanation has been the untold secret, the war. A soldier consumes 50 gallons of fuel a day. The Ukraine War therefore is estimated both from Polish and Romanian import figures of Diesel products, and by the supposed soldiery involved, to consume an additional 6 million barrels a day that goes unreported in IEA oil demand figures. IEA only accounts for 2million barrels growth for 2023 which entirely ignores the increased consumption by Ukraine. 

* Refiner margins are squeezed because of diesel consumption, a necessary fuel for heating the cracking process. If diesel prices remain high, refiners make less money.

I don't know if that's political, or incompetence, but considering that you can't just find actual Ukrainian fuel consumption figures I'd argue it's a fog-of-war type thing.

Long story short, the fundamentals of oil majors are already great; it's mostly the leveraged oil-price play that's hard to time. And at these prices this is back in my buy zone. I had previously opened a position at $97ish and we're back at $97ish on XLE.

Most of the reasons for oil speculation seem flawed on the physical market side which inevitably always wins. I expect oil price to increase into the OPEC meeting June 4th because of the risk to OPEC cuts which will liquidate short-leveraged positions.

Thus price will ""ease off"" as shorts deleverage to avoid such liquidations if OPEC does cut.

Russian oil exports are finally dropping as well, but this is mostly due to oil storage being full. Again, for the war. So Russia has no where to ship the oil fast enough so they are cutting back on production.

China has kept their strategic reserves maximum and they have been refining less export - another signal that they are prepared for war although they don't seem to want to be forced into a war over Taiwan. But if there was ever a time to do it, it'd be now. They'd only get stronger if they can build a pipeline successfully from Iran through Pakistan or Afghanistan to China.

Sorry for the excess info but I think it's important to understand what the oil physical market is doing to understand why what many people think is bearish will actually surprise them and continue to be one of the most consistently bullish trades of the year.",2023-05-30,0,0

Not sure how much higher than can go than 65/barrel, but then again, I didn't think they'd get up this high either.  At these prices, the dividends should hold, especially since oil companies have been cutting expenses the last year.

gad99j_XLE,XLE,XLE DD,"TLDR; Rolling short near term XLE 35P, Long 6/19 XLE 38.21C

Hey all you cool cats and kittens, daddy is here with another play that's not completely retarded. As we all know oil has been bent over the barrel and shown the 50 states multiple times, and everyone here and their wife's boyfriend is trying to play it. That being said we are due for a nice little reversal, and whether the tree huggers like it or not, oil will be here to stay even with the progression of EVs and such. It's used in many different materials in addition to being the main energy source for transportation, at least in the near term. USO/oil ETFs are a stupid way to play oil if you know anything about contango, etc. so the only relatively safe way to play it is using an ETF that tracks oil and energy companies, like XLE. If you check my magic crayons, this ETF has a nice gap to fill and is trending to the upside, just broke some major resistance at the 35-36 level, and is forming the bullish autistic W sign (also known as a cup and handle). 

https://preview.redd.it/x67m0uiggsv41.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c60c0edc39d74622a29f3a2dc8c7f6aae3b093e

When fundamentals and technicals come together, we make a tendie baby with some sweet sauce. The play is essentially a split strike synthetic long if you have the cash to cover the short puts, if not then the calls will likely print too. The short put side is because we don't mind owning an ETF with good companies yielding 6% if this gets crushed, since we can just hold until it rebounds again and sell for a profit. It also helps us cover the cost to buy the calls, by continuously rolling short puts around the major support/resistance line that will likely hold. The call at 38.21 (adjusted) puts it right in the sweet spot of the gap that hopefully will get blown through to the next point of around 42 where it gapped down. Happy fucking.",2020-04-29,16,21
g8t4tc_CVX,CVX,Any advice for LEAP call strategy on XLE?,"So, I've been messing around with options for a little bit, and I'm interested in using them now to make a serious, longer-term investment.

I'm looking at putting a lot of my portfolio into buying 2022 LEAP calls on XLE. My thesis is that the US energy sector is currently very oversold due to the virus/oil crash, but will recover much of its value in the next 1-3 years.

My plan is to purchase OTM calls and roll them forward periodically until my price target is met. At that point, I will close my positions and switch to a different investment.

I'm very skeptical of the ""V-shaped recovery,"" and I expect demand for energy to be suppressed over the next couple years, so I'm aiming at a target below the last decade's average. I'm looking for around ~$55/share, versus XLE's current price of ~$35. 

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this strategy. I have several questions.

Most importantly,

* Do you agree with my thesis? How convincing is the counter-argument?

I'd also welcome suggestions on several technical points:

* How far OTM should I buy? Is it mathematically better to do this in a single far-OTM purchase, or should I do it in smaller steps, periodically closing positions and buying new ones at higher strikes?

* How frequently should I roll the contracts forward? Are there certain conditions I should look for (e.g. doing so during a low-volatility period)?

* I expect volatility to revert toward its historical mean over the next 2 years. Should I hedge against this by buying puts on some VIX derivative? Or should that money just go toward more XLE calls? (If hedging, how do I scale the hedge, and why aren't I better off just putting volatility in the first place if it's that important?)

* I'm planning to buy most of this position on Friday, after XOM/CVX earnings, in hopes of entering on a relatively low-volatility day (and maybe a lower entry point if earnings are a bloodbath). Reasonable?

Volatility across the market is still historically high, even with the sharp drop since the broader market lows. But specifically to the oil & gas space we've seen historic volatility in crude oil futures this week but the stocks involved in the space have largely shrugged it off.

Main Theme derived from Surprise Additional Cuts by Saudi Arabia to increase prices of Heavy-Medium Crude Slate. I expect production cuts to eventually help with global supply drawdown. Inflation Expectation, which are currently low (below Fed Target of 2%) are likely to be positively impacted by a rise in oil prices at the start of Q2.

(1.) Surprise Production Cut in April 2019 from Saudi Heavy & Medium Grades (Additional Cuts Moved to June 2019)

(2.) Brent-Dubai Spread narrows in Q2 2019 to Q4 2019

(3.) Brent-WTI (battle in Light Sweet) will widen in Q1 & Q2 before tightening in Q3 Winner is US Barrels traveling out of Gulf via Exports

(4.) WTI-Dubai Spread will also narrow but remain relatively wide or plus $3

(5.) Fuel Tankers 2020 Low Sulfur Favor Light Crude  

Notes & Thoughts   Battle Between OPEC Light Producers (Libya & Nigeria)  Venezuelan Sanctions seem to be offsetting but still tilt to favor higher prices later in the year - Potential Monroe Doctrine in Western Hemisphere makes this #1 Risk for higher Oil Prices in the very near future. 

Options Strategies likely to Benefit;

Vertical Bull Call Spread  on WTI, XOP, & XLE

Traders attempting to take advantage of the recent sell off in oil and fall in implied volatility, will likely benefit from the increase in realized volatility in June/July. I like options expiring January 17th 2020.

The Vertical Bull Call Spreads will benefit from positive convexity, positive gamma, delta, and vega. Late in the economic cycle positive skew in commodities tends to outperform. I think there are a lot of positive catalyst some dealing directly with supply constraints & potential for Geo-Political headwinds. The uncertainty around Geo-Politics skew prices significantly to the upside and will have an outsized effect in the near future.

2tff69_XLE,XLE,"How are energy ETF's gaining traction? (XLE, VDE)","I have noticed that over the last week, even with oil still dropping, energy ETF’s (XLE, VDE) have risen around 7-8%. A few oil companies such as HAL have risen 10%.  All of the research that I have done points to oil prices staying low for at least the first half of 2015, continued shut down of rigs, and low earnings reports in the next few quarters. 

I am new to investing, but a rebound in Energy ETF’s doesn’t make sense given the oil market. My assumption is that people are jumping on the train early, and the costs will probably fall again in the next couple months. Does anyone have any insight into why these ETF’s are gaining already?
