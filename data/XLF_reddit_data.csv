1jla0q6_XLF,XLF,Recession Narrative vs. Financial Sector (XLF): The Data Tells an Interesting Story,"While the narratives around recession risk are gaining traction, the Financial sector (XLF) isn't showing any clear signs of weakness yet. In fact, the percentage of new highs in the XLF continues to consistently outpace new lows, indicating a strong and resilient uptrend.

https://preview.redd.it/6wil35bis9re1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=068dd0bfe05542063e8285bfcf65b27743b2ab50

The recent pullback? Currently, likely nothing more than profit-taking  -  we’ve seen a reduction in new highs but no corresponding spike in new lows, which suggests no broad-based selling pressure.

This supportive trend quality defenitely challenges the recession narrative. Typically, a recession would significantly impact the profitability of financial institutions, driven by a sharp rise in defaults. But that’s not what the data is showing at this point.

Could a recession be in the cards for the future? It’s possible, but the current data doesn’t suggest it’s imminent - at least for now. What you think. ",2025-03-27,0,17

**Last Week – Slightly higher for stocks put plenty of volatility**.

SPY was up 1.1% on the week, a move less than half of what options were pricing. However, the market had multiple swings of more than 3% within the week and closed the week badly with a selloff on Friday. The VIX closed the week slightly higher but also saw large swings, nearly 30 on the upper end and 22 on the lower end. Last week’s volatile swings in the broader market were largely based on the wild swings in banks both large and small, with large bank Credit Suisse entering the conversation. Some of the best-performing stocks last week were in large-cap tech as a rotation to those names was spurred by lower interest rates and declining treasury yields.

Continuing signs of stress in the banking sector could spook stocks and confuse the options market, attempting to price both the downside market risk of bank runs and the potential for melt-ups happening elsewhere as rotations take place among investors eyeing declining yields (and a potentially dovish Fed). As one example among many, Microsft (MSFT) was higher by more than 12% last week, while KRE (the regional bank etf) was lower by 14%. Those type of competing moves resulted in an overall market that was almost flat on the week, but underneath the hood was some chaos.

Back to treasuries, short-term yields saw some of their wildest swings in years. For instance, the 2-year yield closed the week at 3.85%, down from 5% on March 7th. That’s a fast move. The bond market is essentially calling the Fed’s bluff on where rates will be in the near future. Speaking of the Fed…

**This Week – A Big Decision by The Fed**

A consortium of mid-sized banks sent a letter over the weekend to the FDIC requesting a rules change to guarantee deposits for the next two years in an attempt to stem further bank runs. A couple of weeks ago it was assumed the Fed would keep its foot on the gas on rate hikes and the market was settling into an assumption of higher rates for longer as inflation numbers remained somewhat stubborn. All that has now changed and the Fed has big decisions to make in the next few meetings. The FOMC announcement is Wednesday and a Powell presser follows. The market still assumes a 25 basis point hike (after some thought 50 just a few weeks ago) but a pause wouldn’t be a shock at this point. The reaction by the market to any of those scenarios would be tough to read ahead of time because the reasons given by the Fed are arguably more important.

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, similar to last week. The majority of the move is being priced by options for the actual FOMC day. Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.6% expected move, about $400 on the upside and $380 on the downside. Note the bulge in the expected move chart mid-week, as option IV jumps from about 19 before the meeting to 26 after:

**Last Week – A bad week that somehow got worse**.

The week started off weak for stocks with rising treasury yields and fears of a more aggressive Fed, and got worse on Friday with a bank failure. SPY was lower by 4.5%, a move way beyond what options were pricing. Option vol spiked with the sell-off, with the VIX closing the week near 25, up from 18.50.

**This Week – Eyes on banks, treasury yields, a CPI and the Fed reaction to turmoil.**

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, much higher than last week’s 1.6%. IV now the highest it’s been in 2023. The last time the VIX was 25 was in December of 2022. To say this is a critical week for markets on the macro front would be an understatement. Options were already looking forward to an important CPI report for signs of the Fed’s next moves, but a banking failure last week, largely a result of aggressive Fed moves, throws some chaos into the FOMC guessing game.

Friday’s equity sell-off came alongside a sharp decline in short-term treasury yields, moves that would typically have been in opposite directions over the past 6 months. But the failure of Silicon Valley Bank runs the risk of a flight to safety in short-term treasuries, as well as the potential for more bank runs. The Fed will have to weigh the risks that more rate hikes will have in this new environment, or decide that the inflation fight is more important than other banks that may also be sitting on low-interest rate portfolios. The bond market reaction this week will be one to watch, especially after this week’s CPI. A cool print could give the Fed some breathing room to chill out and maybe even pause soon. A hot print and it’s anyone’s guess what happens next.

Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.5% expected move, about $376 on the downside and $396 on the upside. $376 would match the lows going back to December 28th, 2022, and would mean new lows for 2023:

gym1ou_XLF,XLF,X Gon’ Give It To Ya – A Case For XLF,"**TL;DR with positions at bottom.**

XLF is an extremely liquid ETF that tracks the financial sector. Its holdings are comprised of 67 financial institutions, as seen below (more on this later): 

 
List of all financial institutions:
https://i.imgur.com/zrfWwzN.png

 The options are very cheap, and with the economy booming and everything on the verge of opening, the financial sector is looking ready to go back to pre-covid levels. Essentially, this is a very cheap entry for the potential of a very big payout. Their holdings are also very strong, with their top 3 being Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK.B), JP Morgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC). Their other holdings are also very good; however, for the sake of simplicity and keeping this succinct; I will only focus on the top three as they carry the most weight. Furthermore, with the Fed restarting repo operations on Monday, 6/8, the financial sector should see a bigger boost. A bit speculatory, but I expect the stock market to keep going up until either of the two following events occur: 1) second wave of COVID and/or 2) Trump wins/loses the re-election. I do not see the stock market faltering until after the election as the stock market recovery, and really the economy in general, is Trump's greatest strength right now. 

Anyway, what I like to do is to look at current trends and compare them to similar trends in the past. I know some of you will think TA is wishy-washy and not always accurate, especially in the current stock market climate when cash infusion is at an all-time high. That being said, I’ve been using this strategy to play XLF with major success in the past 3 weeks. The three main indicators I like to follow are the Aroon indicator, MACD, and the momentum indicator. I do use other checkpoints, such as moving averages, support/resistance/Bollinger bands, etc., but will not further discuss those findings here in order to keep it somewhat simple. All TA was done using TOS and Finviz. Findings can also be recreated on Tradingview using the built-in indicators. 

&nbsp;
	
**BRK.B:**

-	**Aroon:** Downward trend noted this past Friday, 6/5; however, it looks like we can ignore this specific indicator as historically, it looks like it didn’t predict significant downward movement. 
-	**MACD:** Recently went positive, historically it looks like this caused the stock to trend upward a good 50-60% of the time. 
-	**Momentum:** Shows an upwards trend since the end of May, historically linked with continued growth for the coming weeks when momentum broke 0.  

&nbsp;

**JPM**:

-	**Aroon:** Downward trend, but can be ignored. Same reason as up top. Moving averages here shed a bit more positive light on predicted movement of this stock. 
-	**MACD:** Went positive on June 1st, and it looks like in the past 10 cases that this has happened, there was a continued upwards trend in the stock price. 
-	**Momentum:** Like BRK.B, this has seen an upwards trend in momentum since the end of May. 

&nbsp;

**BAC**

-	**Aroon:** Downward trend here is a bit more significant, with a good number of previous cases doing a good job at predicting continued downward movement. 
-	**MACD:** Went positive around the time of the other two (most of XLF’s holdings to be exact). Like the previous two, continued growth was seen in similar occurrences. 
-	**Momentum:** Went above 0 around the same time as the previous two and did a pretty good job at predicting further upwards movement. 

&nbsp;

Now for the main overall analysis: 

**XLF**

-	**Aroon:** Upward trend on Friday and this was very telling with previous cases regarding continued upward movement. 
-	**MACD:** Friday’s close showed a very strong upwards trend since the end of May. There has been an upwards trend in this since 5/22.

**TL;DR:** Even if you don’t believe in TA there is still something to be had from the financial sector and instead of betting on any one bank just go all-in on the ETF that tracks all of them.

https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/


I’ve been re-adjusting my portfolio to slowly try get a better risk-adjusted return. The bulk of my portfolio is stuck index funds but my individual picks (thus far) have all exceeded my benchmark SP500 and total market tickers.  Given my portfolio size, running the wheel (and being able to take lots of 100 shares) doesn’t make sense because it would make up too large of a holding in my portfolio. I had been relentlessly searching for a company I was happy with <$10 but I largely didn’t find any. After several weeks to months of waiting and researching, I found the perfect solution for me. What I intend on sharing is my due diligence for your digestion, with the caveat that I’d love feedback on my line of thought.



The Play: Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ($XLF)


$XLF is an ETF that’s been around for about 2 decades. It primarily tracks financial institutions with banks making up its largest holding followed by other financial entities such as insurance agencies. Their top 10 holdings (as for 3/31/2019) are: 1) BRK at 13%, 2) JPM at 11%, 3) BAC at 8%, 4) WFC at 6%, 5) C at 5%.   The remaining include AXP, USB, GS, CB, and CME. $XLF has an expense ratio of 0.13% and quarterly dividend payments currently yielding about 1.9%.


The primary advantage of $XLF is that it is well-diversified. Everyone should already appreciate BRK and it’s diversity of assets but you would also own a few of the top banks all bundled in this ETF. As far as why I believe this is a good play? “Banks aren’t going anywhere.” I often see this as reasoning for a lot of causes. This isn’t going anywhere, that isn’t going anywhere. But let’s try to qualify this. $JPM processes about a trillion dollars alone every year. That number alone should be scary. Adding in other banks into this investment only strengthens the case to own $XLF unless you believe the world will somehow adopt a different vehicle to exchange currencies. (No, this isn’t a subtle endorsement of crypto so don’t even get me started.) The ETF’s top two banks are also well-diversified in their revenue streams, unlike (for example) $GS which is primarily an investment bank. This gives a bit of industry specific added protection against a downturn.


Specific to the wheel, $XLF offers a neat advantage in that you are less exposed to earnings. You don’t have to dodge your expiry dates since the risk is really spread out over the course of time, allowing you to move in and out of positions with a bit more freedom. $XLF also pays a modest 1.9% quarterly dividend, so if you do get assigned- at least you can earn some money. $XLF, despite being an ETF, actually has pretty darn good volume/liquidity. It’s no $SPY, but it certainly has weekly options for your picking.


The biggest risks I see to this play included current interest rates and the industry’s low PE multiple. Since the financial crisis, this ETF has poorly performed compared to the SP500. Banks have not gotten a good return in this historic recovery, though have made steady, less volatile gains. (This can be a benefit if your goal is to get more of continuous income rather than high flying growth.) The current state of interest rates also leave a big question mark. Undoubtedly, the 2Y10Y is the lowest it has been since the crisis, suggesting that the banks have very little room to improve their earnings. Couple this with the now apparent global slowdown, growth is likely to decrease. All this being said, every industry will be affected by interest rates, banks just moreso.



Summary:
$XLF is a decent candidate to run the wheel strategy with. It is well diversified, dividend bearing, and has good liquidity. The primary holdings are well established companies that I believe most investors would be happy to own. However, the recent (<10 year) return in this industry has been meager and is most susceptible to current economic fears (interest rates and global slowdown/lending slowdown).",2019-04-20,32,12
