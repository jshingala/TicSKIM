1e1swz8_MSFT,MSFT,Do I have too much MSFT exposure? 100% MSFT stock with $80k+ gains AND invested in XLK and SCHG ETFs,"I have $80k in gains for MSFT stock in one account so 100% of the portfolio there, and also hold funds like XLK and SCHG in another account which I am slowly DCA'ing into and building. Part of me wants to keep my MSFT shares in the first account (I used to work there so it came with the ESPP) since the gains are enormous, and I sold a bunch over the years (1,000 shares) due to too much concentration and now with this massive gain + owning XLK and SCHG I feel like I am overly concentrated in MSFT. Of course if I never sold 1,000 shares I'd be up like $500k but it's risky. Thinking of slowly selling my MSFT shares over the next 6-12 months to better diversify and put that $ into the 2 ETFs XLK and SCHG since I already have MSFT exposure there? XLK has 22% MSFT holdings and SCHG has 12% MSFT holdings... definitely better for diversification. Thoughts?",2024-07-12,0,46

1dit62d_AAPL,AAPL,XLK rebalancing 06/21 NVDA and AAPL,"As many of you know the XLK is rebalancing this Friday June 21st. Two major changes is the weighting of NVDA and AAPL. Currently NVDA is around 6% and AAPL is 22% of the XLK. Friday NVDA will be around 21% and AAPL will be around 4.5%. That means around 10 billion purchased shares of NVDA and 11 billion shares of APPL sold.¬†

Historically, the performance of a stock like NVDA can experience an increase in price movement going into the¬† ETF rebalancing and see a sell off following, as the rebalancing is digested and profit taking occurs.

For AAPL the opposite can occur as a short term negative selling pressure takes place going into the rebalancing. However post rebalancing is sometimes viewed as a buying opportunity.¬†

As this will occur after hours on 6/21 a lot of buying and selling could occur before the market opens on the following Monday. With APPL there is a pivot point at 208 which I consider a buying opportunity. A few months ago I started buying the June 2026 310 calls and they have performed well. If you are buying calls on AAPL I would give it some time and buy leaps in 2025 post earnings in Q1. This would give you time to capture and news from August 2024 earnings the iPhone 16 release, the post election rally and Xmas spend.¬†",2024-06-18,45,13

t0t7n6_XLK,XLK,Is XLK a good pairing with VTI,"I'm looking at putting $35,000 into a separate portfolio aside for a specific purpose from my regular investing in a new Fidelity account.  The money won't be touched for minimum of 10 years and potentially longer.

Basically what I've come up with is a 75/25 of VTI and XLK 

Reason I went with XLK over QQQ is the I feel top to bottom the companies are stronger in XLK despite XLK having fewer companies

Reason I went with XLK over say Cong, MGK, VUG, VGT or FTEC is that on a weighting scale XLK had the lowest overlap to VTI at just 23% compared to the other ETF's I listed.

g1749g_XLK,XLK,Anatomy of a Trade: XLK Put Ratio Spread,"Hey guys, 

I am posting a thread similar in theme to 'old' r/options, before WSB and Robin Hood. Check out this trade I did recently, in XLK. Feedback welcome. 

**Premise:**
As you may know, the markets have tanked recently and implied volatility is way up. Increases in implied volatility are usually correlated to options being mis-priced. More fear = less pricing precision relative to theoretical value. My trading strategy is to identify and take advantage of these mispricings. I'm not interested in the movement of the underlying, except to hedge my option position. Especially in times of high implied volatility, I prefer to be net short units and short gamma, so I did the following trade. 

SELL 1 XLK MAY2020 2:1 PUT RATIO 74/78 - $1.02cr

**Plan:**
My vision for this type of trade is to collect the theta decay and close the position for a small debit. If the trade is challenged, the ratio spread provides an opportunity to get paid to hold the position. Ratio spreads can also provide a good opportunity to reverse gamma scalp; however, I am not interested in trying to capture directional movement in the underlying. In this case, I try to take most of the $1.00 credit - I put a limit order to close the position for $0.25db per spread. My trade management plan is to rebalance the position deltas as necessary to avoid delta risk. And lastly, if the position gets blown up I have an exit plan to the downside - in this case, if the underlying crosses 69.00/share before expiry, I'm closing the position. 

**Trade:**
On 2020-04-07, I recognized that the implied volatility and puts skew in XLK May Expiry was higher than average - presenting an opportunity. I bought the 78 puts and sold the 74 puts in a 1:2 ratio spread, collecting $1.00 per trade. The position was long about 12 deltas per spread; I did not hedge with stock on trade entry because I had a short position already in QQQ. 

A few days pass, position looking good...

On 2020-04-13, my QQQ position came off, so I was left with undesirable long deltas on the XLK ratio spread. I sold 10 shares per spread (some of the deltas had decayed - the underlying moved up in price and the position was short gamma) to flatten the delta. So far so good.

On 2020-04-14, my limit order for $0.25db was filled. I closed the short stock position right afterwards and was left with a cool $0.50 in profit per spread. Not bad for a week's work. 

**Analysis:**
First of all, yes, I know the market accommodated my position this last week. I also know that there were way better trades I could have put on for the same time period. Most ratio spreads I put on get challenged at least at some point. However, not knowing the future, I have to stick to what I know: In the same expiry, for the same underlying, there can only be one measure of actual realized volatility.",2020-04-14,3,3

Year to date, XLK is up 15.58 (32.22%).  If this trend continues into next year (and it shows now signs of stopping), each contract should net a profit of >1k, which would be >200% gains.

Seems like a nice way to cook some tendies. ",2017-11-21,2,3

4y0i41_XLK,XLK,XLK - Sell high or hold on,Pretty new to managing my own portfolio and I'm curious at what point do I start thinking about selling? A significant part of my portfolio is in XLK and my total gain is 9.43% thus far. This seems like a huge gain to me but I'm not sure what the market cap is for XLK or where to even find this information. For what it's worth my intuition tells me to hold on until there's a sharp decline as the five year forecast is just a big trend line upwards. Any help would be appreciated as would any other tips for beginners thank you,2016-08-16,2,4
