I already have positions in these but looking to increase more. I think these sectors will continue to perform during this year and rotation is happening for quite some time.

Question is: would you allocate your spare financials now, DCA or later on? (If DCA, what events/time frames should I be looking at?)

I am asking because all of them are ripping currently and not sure if I am not shooting myself here with extra purchases.

Would appreciate some constructive answers instead of 'if it's long term who cares'. I don't want to buy an asset and see myself breaking even after several years.",2022-01-12,11,15

hbipv5_XLV,XLV,Thoughts on XLV as a long term investment?,"For those not familiar, XLV is a healthcare ETF, with holdings such as JNJ, UNH, PFE, and MRK.  Looking at its holdings, XLV seems attractive as a long term investment.  These companies provide products people will always need, good times or bad.  Is XLV worth it? Or does it make more sense to just invest in a company like JNJ?",2020-06-18,2,5
fe8hd6_XLV,XLV,Hot Take: XLV Call Option,"Hello autists, bears and bulls,

Gonna keep this one short:

1. Coronavirus scares will be done by the summer. Expecting 20-40% reduction in cases due to heat.
2. Demand of Healthcare to remain steady.
3. Stock is modestly priced, compared to 52 week high and lows.
4. Look to sell after Mid-April.

Market will be up to start tomorrow but the option should be decently priced around lunchtime/closing.

Less Risk: $96 Call 9/17
More Risk: $97 Call 7/17

Keep posted for more hot takes (I'll do a put next for you üåàüêªs).",2020-03-06,15,13

1t7xw2_XLV,XLV,Is there a dividend difference in owning an ETF for every major sector in proportional allocation weights (e.g. XLV as 13.2% of portfolio) or just owning SPY for all US equity-based investments?,,2013-12-19,1,1
1nqig3_XLV,XLV,Health care stocks (via XLV ETF) are up 57% since Obamacare was passed in May 2010.,"http://i.imgur.com/FUUK9JC.jpg

3 points from this:

1.  The chart tells the tale.
2.  Repubs, calm down about 'socialized' medicine.
3.  Dems, this bill was largely written by big health care industry lobbyists (including hospitals, pharma, etc).

(March 2010, not May .. my bad .. gains from May to now are higher.)",2013-10-04,2,7
