1fu94of_XOM,XOM,"Why ExxonMobil, Conoco Phillips, and Lockheed Martin Rallied on a Down Day for the Markets","Shares of oil and gas majors ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Conoco Phillips (NYSE: COP), as well as defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), rallied on Tuesday, up 2.8%, 4.2%, and 3.5%, respectively, as of 1:17 p.m. ET, even as the broader indices were down between 1% and 2% at that time.

Fortunately for their shareholders, but unfortunately for other sectors and the world, these critical companies saw their stocks rally as oil prices spiked on news that Iran was launching an imminent attack on Israel.

On Tuesday, a senior White House official said Iran is preparing to launch an imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel. Then at midday, the Israel Defense Forces reported Iran had in fact launched missiles toward Israel. The attack comes after Israel has struck against Iran's proxy army Hezbollah operating in southern Lebanon. In addition, Israel is preparing a limited military operation in southern Lebanon to clear the area of Hezbollah militants.

Given that Iran and other Middle East neighbors are major oil and gas producers, the prospect of a wider regional conflict has the potential to disrupt oil supplies to the rest of the world. This is why both ExxonMobil and Conoco Phillips rallied along with oil prices, which were up nearly 4.5% to $71.25 as of this writing.

Higher oil prices would obviously benefit the top and bottom lines of Exxon and Conoco. Conoco is a pure explorer, but doesn't have significant production in the Middle East region. And though Exxon is more diversified with midstream and downstream assets, it still makes the bulk of its earnings through oil and gas exploration, and therefore benefits when prices rise. Furthermore, Exxon derives most of its exploration from outside the Middle East.

And obviously, whenever geopolitical tensions ramp up, that usually bodes well for U.S. defense contractors' stocks, with Lockheed Martin being the second-largest U.S. defense contractors by market cap.

Lockheed has actually had a tremendous year, with the stock surging over the summer on the back of better-than-expected earnings and more sales of its F-35 fighter jets to more allied countries.

In addition to general geopolitical news, Exxon and Lockheed also received two positive company-specific bits of news today. Exxon received approval from the Nigerian government to sell its Nigeria offshore assets to Seplat for $1.28 billion. Of note, Nigeria has been somewhat of a difficult geography for oil and gas operators recently, due to theft and corruption. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin received a near $3.9 billion naval contract for its Trident missile systems today, in addition to some smaller aeronautics contracts.

Neither news item is tremendously impactful to either company, given the overall size of these industry giants; however, these items were still likely incremental positives.

While oil and gas stocks are out of fashion for many investors, given the focus on climate change and reducing emissions, they do offer a hedge against geopolitical events, such as the one we are seeing today. Remember, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, traditional energy stocks went on to be some of the best performers that year.

So while oil and gas and defense stocks may not be as exciting as high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) plays these days, they do offer benefits in a healthily diversified portfolio. Moreover, most traditional energy and defense stocks also pay decent dividends.

So, today should be a reminder to investors of the role these types of stocks can play, offering hedges against geopolitical disasters, all while paying you growing dividends in the meantime.

Also XOM reports Earnings this Friday. ALSO XOM is starting a cool DLE, Direct Lithium Extraction process, that is the FIRST in the world, that will not use Ponds,which evaporates water tables, and dries out the land,but will extract lithium chemically and re-insert the water in real time back into the water table.

IBATF 's latest update which is good for EXXON, yes lithium is down NOW, but it won't be down forever, and Exxon is covering their bases and positioning themselves to best be in that Clean Energy Strategic Pole Position.

So the Middle East conflict is gonna pick up oil in my view. And XOM is covering their bases when cars fully pivot to electric by being a major Lithium provider, in a clean novel non ponds way.

Biden Admin also SUCKS at giving OIL permits.

17rhwac_SOFI,SOFI,ExxonMobil passed Tesla as the most shorted stock last month. Here are the 10 names investors are betting against the most.,"ExxonMobil was the most shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500 last month, according to HazelTree.  
Tesla and Apple followed the energy giant in the large-cap sector, according to data from HazelTree.  
Fund managers tracked by the firm also bet heavily against Rivian, SNAP, Ford, and AirBnB.

ExxonMobil Corp replaced Tesla as the most-shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500, according to a report from HazelTree.  
  
Before last month, Elon Musk's car company had held the top spot as the most shorted stock for four consecutive months. When investors short a stock, they are betting that a company's share price will decline.   
  
HazelTree ranks short bets with a ""Crowdedness Score"" of one to 99, with the highest level representing shares shorted by the greatest percentage of funds tracked by HazleTree. The firm collects data on 12,000 global equities and over 700 funds.  
  
In the large-cap group, ExxonMobil and Tesla led the way with scores of 99 and 97, respectively, followed by Apple (94), Charter Communications (91), Broadcom (91), Rivian Automotive (86), US Bank Corp (83), SNAP (83), Ford (78), and AirBnB (78).   
  
The three most-shorted names in the mid-cap sector included SOFI Technologies (99), American Airlines (92), and EV maker Lucid (92).   
  
The report also highlighted the percentage of institutional investors' supply of a particular stock to be loaned to short sellers. In order to short a stock, an investor betting against a particular name must borrow the shares. It then sells them immediately. If the share price fall as expected, the short seller buys the shares back and returns them to the lender and pockets the difference in price.   
  
HazelTree said it tracks how ""hot"" a stock is in terms of supply and demand from short sellers.   
  
Rivian Automotive led the way in institutional supply utilization at 37%, well above ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.   
  
Exxon is down about 6% year-to-date, while Tesla has gained a whopping 76% this year but is dealing with headwinds stemming from uncertain demand for electric vehicles and stiff competition that has led to price cuts on its vehicles over the course of 2023. ",2023-11-09,187,41

12uls9a_XOM,XOM,XOM vs CVX at this point in time? Any love for energy stocks?,"Hey folks, in an attempt to combat the hivemind, let's start a series of discussions! I saw a number of posts asking about different head to head stocks (Pepsi vs Coke, etc...) and thought it would make for some interesting higher effort posts. Here's some background stats for two companies CVX and XOM.

If you had to pick one, which one and why? I'll give my answer at the bottom.

|Metrics|Chevron|Exxon|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Div Yield|3.57%|3.12%|
|P/E Ratio|9.25|8.75|
|Payout Ratio (Fwd)|41.62%|37.55%|
|Market cap|323B|471B|
|Annual Increase Streak|37 yrs|40 yrs|

My personal pick was XOM. Back in early 2020 when there was some panic about oil companies due to oil futures dipping below zero temporarily, I was looking at both to see if I could benefit from the panic. CVX hadn't fallen from its height as much as XOM did. XOM had around an 8% yield at the time due to the price drop. There were concerns that XOM would lose it's dividend streak, but the CEO had come out and stated that XOM would keep its dividends. There was some concern from financial folks that they were being irresponsible with their cash flow, especially as the future looked uncertain especially in terms of travel. Thankfully, they kept their word and XOM has had an incredible recovery run since then.

10wxcs4_PYPL,PYPL,Considering Selling XOM,"Hello everyone!! First off.. I’ve been a long time lurker of the sub & can honestly say I’ve learned a lot from this community so thank you all for that!! So I’m considering selling XOM, I’m not looking for financial advice but more opinions & thoughts about it as I do trust & love the opinions of the veterans investors on this sub. My position isn’t large by any means. I first purchased XOM on March, 3rd 2021 - it was my biggest XOM purchase(5 shares) & my last purchase was December 7th, 2022(0.05 shares) I also made 7 other buys of varying amount between those times.. currently up $365 with a total value of $746. Like I said, not a very large position at all. My reason for selling is I’d like to allocate the money into other investments, that being PG & gold(which I don’t consider as an investment as much as a way to hedge money from inflation). PG is one of my larger positions other than VTI & VOO which I do understand are very similar; however, I just feel better having both. Background for why I love PG.. I have a few different jobs, I run a online store(eBay). I also sell vintage clothing locally. My main source of income is an overnight stocking job & one thing I’ve noticed is how the cleaning supplies isle is almost always empty & almost all those products are made by PG so it just seem like a great long term investment.. not to mention it being a divided king & aristocrat. I started investing about 3 years ago & have never sold & really never planned on doing so either; however, I feel like this would be a time to do so seeing how much XOM has gone up in price. I do believe XOM has more room to grow plus the rising dividend is also very nice but I’m not to focused on squeezing every bit I can out of it if I can make a smart investments with the money I’ve made from it so far.. also a bit of background on myself. I’m 26 years old & plan on hold most my positions as well as the gold I’ve purchased till I eventually pass on. My family or friends for that matter have never been rich or good with money - I’m really the only one of my family & friends who focuses on money & finances. I want to be the one to break that trend of being broke & bringing wealth into my family line. Everything I make in my lifetime will be passed on to my future children, nieces, nephews, brothers, sisters & close friends who are more like family to me.. also have been focusing on building my credit which at the moment is 737.. once my apartment lease is up I plan to rent or possibly look into buying a bigger home that my family can live in. My parents are getting older & while we’ve never been rich they’ve done everything in their power to make sure I’ve lived a great life. I just want my family to not have to worry & live the rest of their life in a nice house were the family can stay when needed & all our pups can have a yard to run free :) but enough about me lol - if you have any other questions on my situation please feel free to ask! Another question, I purchased PYPL November 23rd 2021 at a price of $190 - seeing as PayPal is a payment system at a lot of retailers I thought it was a good investment, but soon after is tanked lol.. so I’m down about $107. Also purchase BABA thinking it would be a good time to get it as it was dropping & I was wrong as it just kept dropping haha.. I bought $100 worth & currently down about $49 on that end. I’m considering selling those to offset the gains I’ve made from XOM but if I do sell XOM would a better plan be to hold off on selling PYPL & BABA to see if a turnaround in price happens? If I do go through with this plan, what are your thoughts? Like I said I respect the opinions of the veterans investors here so your thoughts do mean a lot.. however, the final decision will obviously be on myself. 

Also.. I do have 3 months worth of savings in a savings account for emergencies so I’m not just throwing all the money I earn into stocks & gold but I do make frequent stock, gold & the occasional crypto purchases.

TLDR: Should I sell my shares of XOM & reallocate half or all the funds to PG - option 2 would be to allocate half the funds to PG & the other half into gold.

Finally, thank you all again!! Such a great subreddit! I’ve learn so much so far & I’m so grateful & feel so blessed to be apart of this wonderful community!

Much love to all.

But this year I started noticing my portfolio has too many stocks. I've been investing in dividend stocks since 2017 and have never sold a single company by choice. But now I am thinking I should try to do more with the portfolio. I should try to sell companies at the high phase of their cycle replace them with other companies.

Energy sector is like that now, I don't believe we will have these high prices long term and wanna try it with the first trade in the portfolio. Wanna put money where my mouth is. I either can come back to XOM later for cheaper, or it will be a valuable lesson for me :)

Exxon Mobil Corp.’s cash haul overtook that of Alphabet Inc. for the first time since 2018, proving the oil giant is back in the big league just a year after suffering one of the biggest activist shareholder upsets in corporate history.

Exxon, which lost money for the first time in its history during the pandemic, now ranks as the S&P 500 Index’s third-largest generator of free cash flow, behind only Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

In another sign of oil’s resurgence, Chevron Corp. jumped up in the ranks with a cash inflow that surprised analysts who were already expecting a record quarter.

I was looking at long-term, knowing these companies would be around and that many of them were talking about developing clean-tech and becoming more ""green"". (Forward-Looking).

I do see some additional reasons to hold: 1) we are going into summer -- gas prices are rising/people will be traveling, 2) global geopolitical issues driving demand up, e.g. war btw Russia/Ukraine

\#1/#2 drive demand up and give the oil majors more cash on hand to issue buybacks. These buybacks continue to increase the stock price.

### In the News

Oil, gas and energy companies are some of the best-performing stocks over the past few months, with some at our near all-time highs. Many top the high RSI (overbought) lists after seeing multi-year lows during the pandemic. For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100.

Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either. There are a lot of moving parts for these stocks right now, the war in Ukraine, a potential recession to name a few., but as volatility has visited both the broader stock market and the oil and gas markets, these stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have ”crashed higher” towards all-time highs without seeing corresponding increases in their own option implied volatility. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge, as put spreads for any reverse in oil prices are cheap (relative to oil itself) on the single name company side of things.

Insiders began buying $XOM months before the conflict began on 2/24/22. Exxon's stock peaked at $91.51 shortly thereafter on 3/8/22.

The chart clearly shows a ""Head & Shoulders"" top. This is usually a harbinger of a looming large sell-off, if the ""neckline"" is broken. 

On Monday, $XOM gapped lower. Yesterday, it filled-in most of this gap - leaving behind a small gap between $84.72 and $85.00. It may or may not be filled, but what happens if the H&S neckline is broken is far more important.

Last week, we highlighted the extreme implied vol in energy and commodity-related names. USO, the United States Oil fund, was pricing about a 9% move for the week. It essentially made that move before the week even started as oil futures spiked Sunday and USO was up 8-9% pre-market on Monday. It reversed and by the end of the week actually finished lower, by about 4% on the week. Implied volatility in the space also contracted slightly, with USO options pricing in about a 7% move this week vs the 9% last week. USO IV remains high as its 30 day implied volatility is about 187% higher than its one-year realized volatility.

Some expected moves for the upcoming week: USO: 7%, XLE 4.2%, XOM: 4.2%, CVX: 4.2%, OXY, 7.6%, BTU: 12.4%, WEAT: 9.2%.

Even though IV cam in a bit in these names last week, they continue to show up on the High IV vs historical lists, with interest rate and currency-related ETFs also showing high IV vs historical:

Now I don’t know how correctly I’m applying the definition of “Buy the rumor, sell the news”, but this seems to be a classic example. There’s a rumor, according to Bloomberg, that Exxon is weighing the idea of selling their Bakker asset, which could have a value of $5 billion. Exxon is not commenting on this rumor. 

But if that’s the case, this would immensely raise their value. I’ve read some speculation that this could push their value to as high at $140 a share, but don’t quote me on this! Just speculation. That said, I imagine that by the time the news happens (if it does), the stock price will already be at a high point. Right now we’re in the “rumor” phase, where the stock still has room to grow.

splt68_XOM,XOM,"Demand problems caused by M3 - NUE, NEM, GM, XOM, BRK and other ideas","I mentioned elsewhere I was of the opinion that the issue we face is too much money in the hands of the consumers. A debt-driven (money printed) demand problem and it's global, and entrenched. This is the source I got that from. The thing that always seems to frustrate me is that this great info is readily available, but washed out by other great analyses, and so it seems very hard to see a clear picture until events happen to confirm who was right. This is now from October 2021, but I do think we have more turmoil ahead to adjust for, so if you want to buy for safety or defense, this article may be super useful to you even though it's a bit dated now.

For me, based on this, I'm trying to get into metals, materials, production, but it's hard to get them at a good price this late in the game. A play might be NUE (Nucor). The book is decent and the P/E still low, so the possible return is high and a good amount of safety. The rest of Nucor's financials look acceptable (to me).

But not at this price. This price is the end of a momentum swing. The question for me is will a stock like NUE stay high? Or revert to mean and come down toward $110 - $114? Then it might be a buy.

If something can shock it below that, like the January selloff, then NUE looks like a great buy to hold and sell covered calls on....

NEM is another play I might want to make, but it's not as well valued, and I can't figure out if Gold is going to spike on inflation or crash on real yields going positive.

I think the Oil play is still strong and has room to grow. It's a good cash flow generator.

I think BRK is a good play going into its earnings.

I guess there are energy plays but I haven't looked at any yet. But Energy has been robust as well and is the third highest inflator behind cars then oil.

GM is my car play and I made 5% off it already and am still able to sell calls on it, so will keep pumping cash flow from my GM play - so I still think naysayers are not understanding what GM is now offering and are confusing its 5+ year history with its recent less than 5 year past transition.

**Further information:**

A CGX shareholder wrote the following article and due diligence on the company.

**Summary**

* Guyana is the fastest growing economy in the world and their GDP is expected to double by 2025.
* CGX Energy (OTCPK:CGXEF, TSXV:OYL) is a publicly traded Canadian company and a pure play on Guyana’s oil and gas success and near term exponential economic growth.
* CGX Energy holds three coveted exploration block licenses (Corentyne and Demerara offshore and Berbice onshore) which cover 2.7 million acres gross, 2.3 million acres net combined.
* CGX Energy has captured a unique, much needed, infrastructure opportunity by fast-tracking strategic regional port services with their Berbice Deep Water Port set to be operational next year.
* CGX Energy needs to raise capital to fund their exploration campaign, port development and expansion. It’s the ideal partnership and investment opportunity during an economic boom which can be captured multiple ways.

**Unique Infrastructure Opportunity with Exponential Growth Outlook**

The South American country of Guyana experienced 43.3% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2020, thanks to their emerging oil industry. The NASDAQ stock market now expects their current GDP of $7 billion to more than double by 2025, reaching over $14 billion and beyond. Guyana is the fastest growing economy in the world. National revenues being generated will launch transformational regional growth and fund substantial infrastructure and economic development throughout Guyana including new schools, hospitals, roads and highways, bridges, ferry services, air services etc.

Guyana’s recently elected President Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali campaigned on an agenda of advancing direct foreign investment. In an address at the Latin America & Caribbean Conference on October 21, 2020 Ali made a compelling case for investors, pledging to lower or eliminate barriers to entry, create favorable tax terms, and champion an economic boom to make Guyana the most exciting investment opportunity in the world. Free and special economic zones are expected to be created as discussed in the Guyana Chronicle [here](https://guyanachronicle.com/2020/10/08/444374/).

Today there are eight active drilling rigs located in the Guyana-Suriname basin performing exploration drilling and development drilling activity. When the Maersk Discoverer semisubmersible rig arrives in the next two weeks under contract with CGX Energy (OTCPK:CGXEF, TSXV:OYL), there will be nine. Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has already deployed two floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSOs) to develop their existing discoveries within the Stabroek block and could have at least five FPSOs online by 2026. By that time, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates Guyana will be producing 600,000 bbl/day of oil, which would make it the fifth top producer among non-OPEC countries and ninth foremost globally. Guyana receives \~53% of the profit from Exxon’s Stabroek operations.

Recently reported in the Guyana Kaieteur News, the demand for local port services has grown almost exponentially in the past few years and Guyana has been losing billions of dollars as it lacks the necessary infrastructure to support their developments. More than 75% of the port business servicing offshore oil and gas operations in Guyana and Suriname are provided by Trinidadian ports. The head of neighboring country Suriname’s national oil company, Staatsolie, confirmed the need for a regional deep water port facility to service activities in both countries.

**CGX Energy is a Guyana Pure Play**

CGX Energy is a publicly traded Canadian company and a pure play on Guyana’s oil and gas success and economic boom. Since 1997, CGX Energy has been an active oil and gas explorer both onshore and offshore Guyana. Over the past 20 years, this resilient company has encountered many catastrophic setbacks that most peers would not have survived were it not for their relationships and potential. CGX Energy has managed to hold onto three coveted exploration block licenses 66.67% WI in Corentyne and Demerara offshore and 62% WI in Berbice onshore, which cover 2.7 million acres gross, 2.3 million acres net combined. Their only consortium partner for their offshore blocks is Frontera Energy (OTCPK:FECCF or TSXV:FEC) who holds the other 33.3% WI. After years of comprehensive 3D seismic work the partnership contracted McDaniel and Associates Consultants Ltd in 2020 to conduct an Independent External Prospective Resource Study on their Corentyne North Area, Corentyne Main Area and Demerara Block. This study was completed in accordance with industry standards highlighting 32 prospects (27 in Corentyne and 5 in Demerara) and an independent mean resource estimate of 4.9 billion boe. CGX Energy is now positioned to become an oil and gas Cinderella Story.

A news release regarding their independent external resource report and exploration potential can be viewed [here.](https://cgxenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CGX-Energy-Demerara-PPL-Extension-February-16-2021.pdf)

The Guyana-Suriname basin is the world’s top exploration hotspot, often described as the Holy Grail of oil and gas. According to [Westwood Global Energy Group](https://www.westwoodenergy.com/news/westwood-insight/farm-out-market-in-2020-deal-flow-at-all-time-low-but-success-rates-from-wells-drilled-at-a-5-year-high), “licenses in emerging plays were valued, on average, 1.5 times higher than those in frontier plays and almost 3.5 times those of mature plays over the last five years.” Companies will pay a premium to access emerging plays which have significantly less risk than frontier exploration and where pool sizes are much larger than in mature plays. The largest farm-out exploration deal in the last 5 years was for the Guyana-Suriname basin in 2019 associated with Apache (NASDAQ:APA) prospect Maka Central, where Total (NYSE:TTE) accessed the prospect via a 50% WI and operatorship farm-in to Apache’s Block 58. The Maka-1 well was still being drilled but preliminary results had confirmed the prospectively of the Suriname license. To close the joint venture deal, Total paid Apache a $100MM signing bonus, reimbursed Apache its share of past costs for its first three exploration wells and could pay more depending on further developments. Apache said it would also receive $5 billion of cash carry on it’s first $7.5 billion of appraisal and development capital along with other considerations. Total will eventually become the operator of that block. Total stated in their December 2019 press release that “[Cost of carry and payments would then represent an acquisition cost of around $2 per barrel](https://totalenergies.com/media/news/press-releases/total-enters-suriname-50-operated-stake-exploration-block-58).”

CGX Energy’s Corentyne Block is comparable exploration acreage to adjacent Block 58 and has an independent mean resource estimate of 4.4 billion boe Unrisked and 785 MMboe Risked. One might venture that a farminee might immediately pay $1047 billion or $2/bbl x 785 MMBoe x 66.7% WI just to purchase their full WI in that specific license. If you couple the Demarara block in the farmout deal, the value would be $1,179 billion prior to announcing a single discovery.

The basin’s discovery potential remains significant with multiple prospects yet to be found. Exxon estimates it can contain more than [18 billion boe resources](https://oilnow.gy/featured/resource-potential-of-guyana-suriname-basin-exceed-18-billion-boe-exxonmobil/). 45 wells were drilled over almost a 50 year span resulting in no commercial discoveries until Exxon hit the Liza discovery in late 2015. Since then, more than 9 billion boe resources spanning 18 prospects have been discovered in the Stabroek Block and three other discoveries in the Orinduik and Kanuku Blocks by other companies offshore Guyana. So far, Apache has made four discoveries at Block 58 while Petronas has made one at Block 52 offshore Suriname. Rystad Energy’s upstream team suggested in March 2021 that “close to 300 MMboe has been discovered on average for each exploration well (wildcat and appraisal)” drilled in Guyana in the last 6 years. The lucrative exploration success rate in this emerging basin now stands at \~70% since 2015, compare that to worldwide metrics of 7% success for frontier exploration and 11% success in mature basins according to Wood Mackenzie in 2020. That quality of exploration potential should deliver profound market upside for a company the size of CGX Energy trading at US$1.36 per share OTC and having only US$391 million market cap at time of my writing.

CGX Energy is now mobilizing the Maersk Discoverer rig to test their Kawa prospect in the Northern Area of the Corentyne Block. This acreage is flanked by international heavyweights on three sides including operators Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Apache (NASDAQ:APA), Qatar Petroleum and Repsol (OTCQX:REPYF) which are obvious farminee candidates. The Kawa-1 well is expected to be drilled to a depth of approximately 6,500m in water depth of approximately 370m and should spud within weeks in August 2021 then be completed in 75-85 days. The primary target is a Santonian age, stratigraphic trap, interpreted to be analogous to the four significant, adjacent, and on-trend Apache discoveries immediately to the east on Block 58 in Suriname; Maka Central, Kwaskwasi, Sapakara West and Keskesi East. Exxon’s Haimara and Pluma discoveries in the Stabroek Block are also in close proximity but are not considered the best offset analogues as they were shallower wells which landed in younger Campanian formations, obviously the stacked pay potential from those formations may yet exist.

CGX Energy’s July 2021 operational update regarding Kawa-1 can be viewed [here](https://cgxenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CGX-Energy-Provides-Operational-Update-and-Results-of-Annual-General-Meeting-12July2021.pdf).

**Infrastructure**

In addition to the exciting exploration potential, CGX Energy, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Grand Canal Industrial Estates Inc (GCIE), is a unique emerging infrastructure development. The company is fast tracking construction of the strategic, high profile Berbice Deep Water Port (BDWP) on 30 acres of land on the eastern bank of the Berbice River to meet the dire need and explosive growth in the region. The construction of it’s wharf platform is scheduled to commence in September 2021. The facility is designed to have a 220m length wharf platform that is 30m wide, accessed by a 50m trestle. An approved dredging program is intended to ensure continual unencumbered access to supply and cargo vessels. Depth is targeted to be maintained at a 7m low-tide draft within the berth area and access channel that leads to the BDWP pier. GCIE also owns and operates a 16 acre laydown yard in Berbice at Bramfield. This facility is fully permitted and operational as a logistics base and will service the BDWP only 3.2km away. The capital cost for the project to 2023 is now estimated at US$70 Million. GCIE’s projected investment is in the range of US$130 Million with further expansion to construct heavy lift and fabrication facilities being assessed.

In a [news release on July 12, 2021](https://cgxenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CGX-Energy-Provides-Operational-Update-and-Results-of-Annual-General-Meeting-12July2021.pdf), CGX Energy shared the following forward looking statements:

“Work is on schedule for the operationalization of the offshore oil and gas support shore base by mid-2022 and for the operationalization of containerized cargo, agricultural cargo and specialized cargo terminal by the end of 2023.

The BDWP intends to service growing offshore demand in the oil and gas sector and significantly shorten supply routes, simplify logistics, and reduce cost and operational risk. Travel time from the BDWP to offshore fields is approximately 12 hours compared to approximately 2.5 days to regional ports currently used by operators. The BDWP port will enable provisioning of operators and vendors in territorial waters of both Guyana and Suriname.

The Company commissioned an independent market assessment study for the BDWP, conducted by Maritime & Transport Business Solutions (“MTBS”) of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. According to the MTBS marketing report, the BDWP is expected to service the demands of 1 offshore well in 2022 following start-up; growing to 7-12 offshore wells / year beginning in 2023. The BDWP is positioned to play a leading role in the expansion of the oil and gas sector in Guyana and Suriname. The MTBS report predicts revenue generation from 2022 related to offshore oil and gas services reaching approximately US $37 million by 2025 and steadily increasing thereafter. The life-cycle of a producing field requires support, consumable supplies, equipment and services.

The BDWP’s containerized, specialized and agricultural cargo operations are targeted to be fully operational by the end of 2023. The MTBS marketing report predicts that by 2030, the port will handle over 835,000 tons of cargo, with 64% of this related to the export of rice. Approximately 30 - 50% of the rice grown in Guyana is produced in regions 5 and 6 and the BDWP will provide important support to this industry and service its expected growth. The BDWP report predicts revenue generation from the cargo handling operations of the port to reach approximately US $28 million by 2025 with steady growth predicted, reaching approximately US $37 million by 2030.

The Company also commissioned MTBS to prepare a financial model for the BDWP, with inputs from GCIE as well as other advisors and consultants such as Aqua & Terra Consultores Asociados S.A.S and SRKN’gineering and Associates Ltd. The financial model predicts that the payback year for the project is 2025 with an above industry average net present value and internal rate of return values.

This is a transformative project for the enablement of local content in the oil and gas industry and for the transformation of the country’s agricultural and commercial sectors.”

A detailed overview of the Berbice Deep Water Port Project can be viewed [here.](https://cgxenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deep-Water-Port-Presentation-14-October-2020-Website.pdf)

From an ESG perspective, without this port there are cost, fuel and carbon footprint concerns for companies operating in Guyana and Suriname supported by Trinidad based ports. Due to the sailing distance, they use at least 5 times more fuel, leading to increased carbon emissions and escalation of costs related to fuel consumption, equipment rental, wear and tear and complicated logistics.

BDWP is a profound opportunity not only for CGX Energy, but also for Guyanese people seeking to capitalize on the emerging jobs in the oil and gas industry. The BDWP is expected to create some 1,000 direct jobs during the construction phase with 300 persons employed when the Port is fully operational.

**Funding and Risk Factors**

CGX Energy may have difficulties raising equity as they are in a capital-intensive exploration and development phase pre revenue, particularly without excessively diluting shareholders. In April 2021, CGX Energy leveraged their relationship with Frontera Energy to secure a US$19 Million Loan Agreement to finance their budgeted costs for 2021. Frontera Energy has been highly supportive of CGX Energy but their cash infusions are limited in size and durability. A more substantial JV partner could rapidly scale and monetize CGX Energy’s strategic advantages. That would be a huge win for the region as well as for the consortium shareholders.

Ports are excellent investments, particularly ports in economic zones while they are ramping up. Profitability for such a strategic asset could be in the range of 60-70%. EBITDA multiples for a fair market valuation often range between 10 to 30 times. In 2007 Warburg Pincus LLC partnered with the Gangavaram Port in India during the early stages of port development. The new port began commercial operations in 2009. In March 2021 Warburg Pincus sold their 31.5% stake in the Indian port to the Adani Group for approximately US$268 million, an implied EBITDA multiple of 9x and P/E multiple of 12x. You can assess the transaction announcement [here](https://warburgpincus.com/2021/03/03/adani-ports-to-acquire-31-5-in-gangavaram-port-from-warburg-pincus-for-rs1954-cr-all-india-market-share-rises-to-30/). Just a few days later, Bloomberg reported that Warburg had reinvested US$110 million for a 0.49% stake in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zones Ltd. (XNSE: ADANIPORTS). Adani Ports is currently trading with an EBITDA multiple of 21x and aims to double EBITDA by 2025. CGX Energy’s BDWP is projected to be paid back and generating US$65 million in 2025, it may then be worth US$887 million assuming 65% profitability and 21x EBITDA.

In a 2007 International Tribunal on the Law of the Seas maritime boundary dispute with Suriname, CGX Energy financed a significant portion of Guyana’s legal expenses at a cost of nearly $10 million. Often considered Guyana’s indigenous oil and gas operator, there is strong working relationship between CGX Energy and the government. In 2019, the Natural Resource Fund Act (NRF) was passed which created Guyana’s sovereign wealth fund. The NRF is currently held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, as of February 2021, has a balance of $246.5MM. If necessary, given the importance of the BDWP to Guyana’s growth trajectory, President Ali may leverage the NRF to help CGX Energy secure infrastructure lending. Sovereign wealth funds support their nation’s long-term economic vitality and often direct investments overseas. They focus on two objectives: acquisition of assets and real estate, and the purchase of shares in high quality financial and industrial firms. Investing in the BDWP project is an ideal fit. Guyana’s largest trade partners are the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, and Venezuela. Trade is radically increasing with the United Arab Emirates, Austria, Japan, Ukraine and India. Sovereign wealth funds from any country wishing to strengthen their relationship with Guyana should consider investing in key infrastructure there. Ports support the efficient movement of commerce which strengthens, modernizes, and reduces costs for all involved.

As with any exploratory player, CGX Energy is exposed to weather related and geologic risk with respect to its construction and offshore operations. In addition, lesser risks commonly associated with emerging markets, including political and social instability cannot be entirely ignored.

PT $90,"Exxon produce \~1.5 billion barrels of oil per year; statement in its previous 10K -- not including natural gas. So increasing of $10/barrel would give $15B, more than its annual dividend cost. Crude oil was around $50 toward the end of 2020. Today, it's around $70-$75 now and it continuously rising.

Also, operating cost cuts with CAPEX cost cuts will most likely mean more Free Cash Flow to pay a dividend and hike a dividend (current $0.87/share) by the end of this year. Exxon seems to turn thing around and with crude oil keep rising above 52-week high, XOM is going to crush it next earning report by end of July.

* Steel, cement and chemicals are essential materials to satisfy needs (home and road construction, appliances, etc) which are energy-intensive products

Global energy demand rises by 20%

* By 2040, the anticipated 20% increase in energy demand reflects the growing population and rising prosperity
* Global energy demand by transportation accounts for 30%
* China and India contribute to

Global electricity demand rises 60%

* Electrifying households, businesses, factories, smart appliances, etc. creates a greater need for electricity
* Solar, wind and natural gas contribute the most to meeting growth in electricity demand
* Electricity generation largest and fastest-growing sector primarily due to expanding electricity access to developing countries

Risks and Mitigations: Climate Crisis Concerns

* In December 2020, they released a 5-year plan that detailed their plan to address a lower-carbon future

# Other Observations

The stock price of ExxonMobil moves relative to the price of crude oil. In an article posted today, May 6th, oil prices fell 1% on worries over the pandemic surge in India. Projections over India's COVID cases are expected to peak around May 15th which can have an impact on oil prices and lead to a drop in ExxonMobil's stock price. If the drop in oil prices is drastic enough from India's surging cases, this creates a great entry point for individuals to get in on ExxonMobil.

# Final Thoughts

ExxonMobil is a company that is repositioning for a lower-carbon energy future by investing more into new technology and initiatives that will align with the growing economy while addressing global concerns. They are a good investment opportunity that has shown a steady rebound since the market fall in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and will continue to be a great growth stock with a lot of upside potential.

Exxon Mobile is one of only oil companies that has stubbornly dug in and not started a meaningful transition to renewable energy now that BP finally announced a *massive* shift last quarter. 

Should you remove XOM from your portfolio? I don’t know. But if *you* think you should, you’d better do it soon. If they slash that dividend, the stock will plummet. My guess is a 60-70% div cut followed by a 30-40% drop in market cap as investors exit.

XOM - Exxon Mobil - Sounds like this is one of the ""safer"" ones out there as far as oil goes. The dividend on this is less than that of the other 2 at 4%

CVX - Chevron - Similar to XOM, but the dividend is 5.3% at current prices. 

RDS.A - Shell - 9.3% Dividend! The chart looks worse than the other 2 though as it's trending down pretty hard. Seems riskier. Just this week Shell dropped from 45/share to 40. More than a 10% drop in 1 week.

2t7sv8_XOM,XOM,Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends $MMM $XOM $PG $UGI $ARLP $GLP,"Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends

The best-known collection of stocks that keep increasing dividend payments is the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.

This is where you’ll find blue chip dividend stocks like 3M $MMM), Exxon Mobil $XOM and Procter & Gamble $PG … stocks that have given investors annual dividend increases for at least 25 years in a row.

There are two other things a stock needs to be an Aristocrat… a market cap of at least $3 billion and average daily trading volume of $5 million.

Those are some serious hurdles, aren’t they?

This is why the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats get so much attention.

But what about the stocks that grow dividend payments that don’t have heavy trading volumes, and aren’t huge companies with big market caps?

Here’s where to go find them.

Here are four great places to find stocks with growing dividends, and each one of them flies under the radar compared to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 

The Dividend Champions – These are like junior versions of the Aristocrats. The Dividend Champions have raised dividends for the past 25 years, but they don’t have to be an S&P 500 stock. And there are no liquidity requirements.

The Dividend Achievers – These stocks have increased dividends for the past 10 years, and the liquidity requirements aren’t tough. Daily trading needs to be above the $500,000 mark.

The Dividend Contenders - Just like the Achievers, these stocks have raised dividends every year between 10 and 24 years. Unlike the Achievers, there are no liquidity restrictions… the stock does not need $500,000 worth of trading every day.

The Dividend Challengers - These stocks have raised their dividends between 5 and 9 years in a row.

Now that you know where to find stocks that have a history of raising their dividends every year, here’s how to get the breakthrough you need for your portfolio.

It’s all about balance. It’s a simple lineup of different kinds of dividend stocks that offset strengths and weaknesses.
