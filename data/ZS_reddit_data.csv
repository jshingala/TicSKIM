""Kristin Herman said using a “buy now, pay later” service to pay for a last-minute trip to Miami felt like a lifesaver.

She said the approval was quick, and there were no upfront costs **—** but she accidentally skipped a scheduled payment.

“One missed reminder turned into fees,” she told [CNBC Travel](https://www.cnbc.com/cnbc-travel/).

Rane Teo, however, said he used a buy now, pay later — or BNPL — plan to break up the cost of a weekend stay for his family on the Indonesian island of Batam.

His experience with splitting the cost into three monthly installments? “Easy and convenient,” he said.

Both Herman and Teo are part of the growing number of travelers who are using BNPL services to pay for flights, hotels and cruises in installments, in some cases with no interest or late fees.

BNPL company Klarna in September announced that the value of travel bookings it processed increased 50% in the past year, while [Affirm](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AFRM) reported its travel and ticketing volume rose 38% year on year in the final quarter of 2024, crossing the $1 billion mark.

In 2025, nearly one in five American travelers said they plan [to use a BNPL service to pay for their summer vacations,](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/2025-summer-travel-report) according to a March report by the personal finance website NerdWallet.""

Original note below:

The brutal selloff in high-growth Software as a Service (SaaS) names seems to have finally run its course. While $NVDA still looks fairly valued here, I've been aggressively buying the dip in beaten-down SaaS plays as interest rate cuts get priced in.

**$MDB** - Initiated a position at $380. Expect this one to start ripping higher in the coming weeks as the easy comps and growth re-accelerates.

**$SNOW** - Bought at $168. Looking to be green on this one tomorrow already and I think it takes out the February highs before summer is over.

**$ZS** - Started building a position around $192. Expect this to cross $200 on earnings and make a run towards $250 later this summer. There have also been some interesting acquisition rumors swirling around. Details in this write-up (long but highly recommend reading):

1cj8rco_ZS,ZS,FTNT Results - buy ZS and CRWD,"ZS and CRWD are buys after FTNT's disappointing earnings

TL;DR: FTNT's shift towards SASE solutions at the expense of legacy firewalls bodes well for cloud security players like ZS and CRWD. I doubled down on ZS.

FTNT reported weak billings and highlighted their transformation towards becoming a major SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) player, moving away from traditional firewalls. While the market initially punished cybersecurity stocks, a deeper dive suggests this is actually good news for cloud-based security vendors.

The key takeaways:

* PANW: Neutral to Negative. Palo Alto still relies heavily on firewalls, so we can expect a poor quarter from them based on FTNT's results.
* ZS: Positive. The accelerating shift from firewalls directly benefits ZScaler's cloud security offerings. Despite potential share loss, ZS will grow rapidly in dollar terms. They've been aggressively building their sales force to capitalize on this trend. I'm doubling down - expecting ZS to hit $220 within a month and $350+ within a year.
* CRWD: Buy. While I believe ZS will outperform, CrowdStrike is still a solid buy given current tailwinds.

FTNT's pivot shows legacy firewall vendors losing ground to cloud security disruptors like ZS and CRWD. I took advantage of the dip to load up on ZS. Their future looks incredibly bright as secure cloud adoption continues accelerating.

  
PS: FTNT will be an amazing buy at $40. ",2024-05-03,9,15

NO Position yet thus flair: discussion. **TDLR:** Puts on ZS, 200P or below

**Hypothesis:** Palo Alto Networks (PANW) dropped nearly 30% last week after reporting earnings. PANW, Zscaler, CrowdStrike, Sentinel One have been beating on earnings and revenue for last several quarters. PANW Guidance was negative: less demand in government, overall market spending fatigue, and strategic shift for them causing short-term uncertainty (ChatGPT has the detail summary below from [earnings call script](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/02/20/palo-alto-networks-panw-q2-2024-earnings-call-tran/)).  It's recovered a bit thanks to Pelosi & other money buying the dip. This might be a sign other cybersecurity industry may be reducing guidance overall. PANW makes hardware in addition to software and are profitable while ZS, CRWD, S, pure software and cloud with no profits.

**The play:** ZS, CRWD reacted but also recovered last week. ZS reporting this week (2/29). I'm thinking possible repeat. ZS@242 currenlty. Maybe 20% drop so 200P or below could be good.  If ZS drops then CRWD, and S would drop. S did drop hard same time last year. Current prices of this week's PUTS below. Earnings still some days away so they can still depreciate. Might be good to lotto some in case ZS dumps hard, should offset IV (155%) some since C/P ratio at 66% (more open interest on calls this week too), not pricing in downward price pressure.

ChatGPT detail summary of why PANW tanked:  
 

It appears that the stock price of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) may have been affected by a combination of factors, including the announcement of their fiscal Q2 2024 earnings. Here's a summary of key points that could have influenced investor sentiment:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Palo Alto Networks reported robust growth, with revenues growing 19% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating margins expanding by nearly 600 basis points, and a 39% increase in non-GAAP EPS. This indicates a strong financial performance, which is typically positive for stock prices.
2. **Investment in Growth and Innovation**: The company highlighted substantial investments in their three platforms - network security, Prisma Cloud, and Cortex - and achievements like continued ARR growth in their SASE business and leadership in cloud workload security. While investment in growth is essential, it can sometimes concern investors about the short-term impact on profitability.
3. **Softness in US Federal Government Market**: The company noted a significant shortfall in their US Federal government business, attributing it to deals that did not close as expected. This situation, anticipated to continue into Q3 and Q4, could be a potential reason for concern among investors, impacting the stock negatively.
4. **Guidance and Strategic Shifts**: Palo Alto Networks provided guidance for Q3 and the fiscal year, indicating expected growth. However, they also discussed a strategic shift towards accelerating platformization and consolidation, aiming for a $15 billion ARR by 2030. While ambitious, strategic shifts can lead to uncertainty among investors, affecting stock price.
5. **Platformization and Consolidation Strategy**: The company is focusing on a platformization strategy, emphasizing reducing execution risk for customers by offering extended rollout periods and aiming for larger, long-term contracts. This approach, while potentially beneficial in the long term, might have led to concerns about short-term financial impacts, especially regarding billings and revenue growth.
6. **Demand and Spending Fatigue**: Despite strong demand, the company mentioned that customers are facing spending fatigue in cybersecurity, seeking better ROI and total cost of ownership. This acknowledgment might raise concerns about future sales growth and the competitive environment.
7. **AI and Future Growth Opportunities**: The company is optimistic about leveraging AI for future growth, identifying it as a significant opportunity. While this could be seen as positive, it also adds a layer of execution risk and investment that might concern investors focused on short-term returns.

In summary, while Palo Alto Networks demonstrated strong financial performance and has a clear vision for future growth, concerns about the US Federal government market, the impact of strategic shifts on short-term financial metrics, and broader market conditions could have contributed to the stock price movement. Investors might be weighing the balance between short-term uncertainties and the potential for long-term growth and market leadership.",2024-02-27,14,28

16a1o35_ZS,ZS,"Expected moves this week, QQQ, SPY post labor day IV crush, ZScaler and Docusign earnings","Option vol got slammed last week into the 3 day weekend. The VIX closed at 13, down from 18 on August 18th while the SPY rallied 4% during that time. Weekly SPY vol really got crushed into the long weekend with at-the-money options in SPY for this next week in single digits. That should pick on the open as market makers reset for the new week. 0DTE options in SPY which had been pricing in 0.6-.07% daily moves were back below 0.5%. Keep an eye on those if IV ticks up from 7 to 10 just after the long weekend.

Despite the uptick in realized vol in the market from the very low levels of the spring grind higher, the SPY has basically remained in about a 6% range since June. The past week's rally put it near the top of that range.

The economic calendar perhaps has bigger news overseas this week than domestically, so those are included below. The earnings calendar is winding down over the next two weeks but this week sees reports from Zscaler and Docusign. Below are this week's expected moves, they are smaller both because its a 4 day week but also as vol got crushed into the long weekend. Those may tick higher on the open:

* **SPY Expected Move: 0.8%**
* **QQQ Expected Move: 1.3%**

rewkyz_ZS,ZS,Zscaler $ZS price target for 2022?,,2021-12-12,22,22
qpri9s_ZS,ZS,A couple of pairs worth watching [AMAT/SNPS; PANW/CRWD/ZS],"One of the things I love watching for is trades within sectors that I know somewhat, where one or two businesses report earnings, followed (over a period of one or more trading days) by other businesses in the same sector. On earnings, stocks in the same sector tend to all fall or rise together (e.g., UBER, LYFT) absent some sort of significant differentiating factor that comes in during the earnings report or in the guidance, unless there are clear signs that market share is definitely being taken away from one player to the benefit of another (e.g., AMD, INTC). 

Take Lyft and Uber. Lyft reports before Uber, generally, so a positive report and guidance for Lyft (which is much smaller, lacking a global footprint and certain businesses Uber has) generally results in Uber shares rising the day after Lyft reports (assuming, of course, that Lyft rises as a result of the positive report and guidance). The same generally occurs when Lyft stock drops on account of a negative report and/or guidance- Uber drops, unless people are counting heavily on different business lines shoring up Uber's balance sheet and earnings for some reason. Occasionally you might get some decoupling because, for example, a pandemic forces large international markets into lockdown while the U.S. remains open, but, for the most part, the pattern holds. (Just don't expect to hold Uber up to and past its earnings date based solely on how LYFT did!)  


By contrast, an earnings report and guidance that lifts AMD does not always lift Intel. AMD and Intel's offerings come about as close to direct substitutes as one can get; in the PC and server markets, we basically have a duopoly.

So let's take those out of the picture, shall we?

Applied Materials reports next week. I am long AMAT (LEAPS long) because I believe there's a secular trend of increasing CapEx for semiconductor manufacturing equipment (built by the likes of AMAT) that is supported by the massive supply chain shortage plus the movement of manufacturing facilities out of countries like China, plus the metaverse, obviously. (The last factor is more psychological than anything at the moment, but it's clearly material to investors who pumped up every semiconductor manufacturer in the universe last week.) What I am not inclined to do is to gamble on AMAT earnings at this point, as the date is too close, and 90 percent of the run-up has already occurred, which leaves me to (more likely than not) be IV crushed. Plus, there are some significant negative catalysts standing between today and the earnings date. But there is a higher margin business in the same sector as AMAT that reports much later.

Synopsys owns a lot of IP in the semiconductor space, and does silicon design and verification work, silicon manufacturing design, and software security assessment/validation work. In short, SNPS does all the things one would need in an environment where AMAT and all of the other semiconductor manufacturers prosper. Good guidance and earnings reports in the coming days from the likes of AMAT and NVDA should prove a boost to SNPS stock in the days following earnings reports for AMAT and NVDA; bad news should have the opposite effect. For the reasons I state above, once I complete my own DD I am likely to run with SNPS longs that I hold through earnings (SNPS reports in December). 

&#x200B;

The same goes for the cybersecurity space, where Palo Alto Networks reports the week of 11/18, followed in a couple of weeks' time by Crowdstrike and ZScaler, which are all pure-play cybersecurity stocks. 

The point is to own/short the later-reporting stock (or options in the underlying) next week so that you benefit from the sympathetic rise/fall that occurs when the earlier-reporting company reports its earnings and guidance next week. Don't bother acquiring them this week because retail starts reporting next week and that's liable to tank everything as the numbers and guidance will be depressing from all but the most well-prepared retailers. 

Additionally, you probably don't want to own a whole lot of anything (longs) past November 9, either. Why? Inflation numbers for October get reported on 11/10 before open, and if they are anything but low AF, stocks likely will see a shock as a result. At a minimum, give it a few days before jumping back in.

P.S. If the AMAT/SNPS interplay appeals to you, NVDA's earnings report and guidance are worth watching for a similar sympathetic change. NVDA reports 11/17, the day before AMAT on 11/18. Any indication that NVDA is ramping up production, getting additional contracts for metashit, or is less dependent on cryptominers than it is on gamers will all benefit NVDA and (to a lesser extent) will pump up AMAT. But again, I think the odds of the market tanking (not a correction, but enough to cost you serious money if you are highly leveraged) after the 11/10/2021 October inflation report and/or depressing reports/guidance from retail are high enough that you should wait until closer to NVDA's earnings date to try this out.",2021-11-09,11,8

Feedback welcome.

**1. Overview**

* **Israeli Cybersecurity cloud player** – $CYRN is way cheaper to participate in cybersecurity market and follow growth of 2020 rockets Zscaler ($ZS) and Corwdstrike  ($CRWD) [which are way overvalued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/these-3-tech-stocks-are-absurdly-overvalued-right-now/ar-BB19Nayp)
* **Strong institutional investors** – ""smart money"" invested at $0.75 ([2020 convertible](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-private-placement-convertible-104000290.html)), $1.15 ([2021 offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-13-8-million-132000789.html)), $2.50 ([2017 tender offer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warburg-pincus-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-ordinary-shares-of-cyren-ltd-nasdaq-cyrn-300575212.html))
* New product revenue up 140% in Q4 2020 (growth masked by decline in retired products)
* **Big tech customers** (Microsoft $MSFT, Google $GOOG, Zscaler $ZS, Fireeye $FEYE) and partners (Palo Alto Networks $PANW) with over 1.3 Billion combined users
* **Catalysts** – New products (Cyren Inbox Security), Microsoft Azure partnership, Palo Alto Cortex partnership, Solarwinds hack – both Microsoft & FireEye are Cyren customers, Blockchain security
* **Acquisition target?** Microsoft & Palo Alto are serial acquirers of Israel technology companies; Cyren competitors Mimecast ($MIME) & Proofpoint ($PFPT) also acquired Israel companies. Is $CYRN next?
* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""While Q3 revenues were down slightly year-over-year, it is important to point out that our results **do not yet reflect material contribution from our growth initiatives**, although significant progress on that front was made in the quarter.

The **revenue decrease is primarily related to the end-of-life of some of our legacy offerings** on the Cyren Cloud Security platform, including Cyren Web Security, and the installed base is winding down through 2020 and into mid-2021. The lower revenue recognition during the period is partially attributed to the decline of revenues associated with those products.""

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""As we discussed on prior calls, 2020 was a transition year for Cyren as we retired a number of legacy SMB products in order to focus on new enterprise products introduced this year, and as such, **revenues were expected to decline until the impact from new products offset the loss of revenue from discontinued products**.

As Brett mentioned previously, we saw good traction in the fourth quarter as revenue recognition from **CIS increased 140% quarter-over-quarter**. Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

c. **Customers**

Many of the customers listed on the website are HUGE players in the tech space.  Some of these are security companies, and all are large enough to do an acquisition of cybersecurity technology for $100M-$200M.

* **Microsoft – market cap $1.7T+**

There are lots of articles and PRs on the Microsoft partnership –

* Forcepoint, Web.com, Sophos, Watchgard – all were previously public and now are private equity

NOTE - the companies in **bold** have acquired companies in security and/or in Israel.

d. **Partnerships**

Some of these customers they talk about as partners – like Microsoft.  It isn’t clear if Microsoft is reselling Cyren products or just using their technology.  But the most recent press release in January makes it sound like they helping to sell the new CIS product.

* **Microsoft** \- [Cyren Inbox Security and Incident Response Service Expands Availability Through Azure Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-inbox-security-incident-response-131500765.html)
* **Palo Alto Networks** \-[ Cyren Joins Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-joins-palo-alto-networks-131500275.html)

[They also said on the Q4 quarterly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) call that Palo Alto has big penetration into global 2000 and Fortune 100 enterprises – maybe this opens the door for more enterprise customers –

**""Additionally, we are pleased to announce a partnership with Palo Alto Networks**, one of the industry leaders in cloud security. We've recently integrated our enterprise threat intelligence solution threat in depth with Palo Alto's Cortex XSOAR platform, which is a leading security orchestration, automation and response platform. Cortex SOAR is used by security teams in **34% of the global 2,000 and 65% of the Fortune 100 enterprises** to simplify and harmonize security operations across an enterprise.""

I found the $PANW partnership even more interesting because (a) their founder is Israeli, and (b) they have acquired so many companies in Israel (see below).

e. **Recent Funding**

Cyren's most recent funding was [closed in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-closing-13-8-154500221.html) \- $13.8 million at $1.15 per share.  A week before the offering, the stock was trading at $1.40+, including one after hours session it spiked to over $2.00.

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

* **Palo Alto Networks** \- Nir Zuk Israeli founder (formerly Check Point).  Acquired 8 different Israel companies since 2014.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report)

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

Feedback welcome.

**1. Overview**

* **Israeli Cybersecurity cloud player** – $CYRN is way cheaper to participate in cybersecurity market and follow growth of 2020 rockets Zscaler ($ZS) and Corwdstrike  ($CRWD) [which are way overvalued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/these-3-tech-stocks-are-absurdly-overvalued-right-now/ar-BB19Nayp)
* **Strong institutional investors** – ""smart money"" invested at $0.75 ([2020 convertible](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-private-placement-convertible-104000290.html)), $1.15 ([2021 offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-13-8-million-132000789.html)), $2.50 ([2017 tender offer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warburg-pincus-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-ordinary-shares-of-cyren-ltd-nasdaq-cyrn-300575212.html))
* New product revenue up 140% in Q4 2020 (growth masked by decline in retired products)
* **Big tech customers** (Microsoft $MSFT, Google $GOOG, Zscaler $ZS, Fireeye $FEYE) and partners (Palo Alto Networks $PANW) with over 1.3 Billion combined users
* **Catalysts** – New products (Cyren Inbox Security), Microsoft Azure partnership, Palo Alto Cortex partnership, Solarwinds hack – both Microsoft & FireEye are Cyren customers, Blockchain security
* **Acquisition target?** Microsoft & Palo Alto are serial acquirers of Israel technology companies; Cyren competitors Mimecast ($MIME) & Proofpoint ($PFPT) also acquired Israel companies. Is $CYRN next?
* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""While Q3 revenues were down slightly year-over-year, it is important to point out that our results **do not yet reflect material contribution from our growth initiatives**, although significant progress on that front was made in the quarter.

The **revenue decrease is primarily related to the end-of-life of some of our legacy offerings** on the Cyren Cloud Security platform, including Cyren Web Security, and the installed base is winding down through 2020 and into mid-2021. The lower revenue recognition during the period is partially attributed to the decline of revenues associated with those products.""

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""As we discussed on prior calls, 2020 was a transition year for Cyren as we retired a number of legacy SMB products in order to focus on new enterprise products introduced this year, and as such, **revenues were expected to decline until the impact from new products offset the loss of revenue from discontinued products**.

As Brett mentioned previously, we saw good traction in the fourth quarter as revenue recognition from **CIS increased 140% quarter-over-quarter**. Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

c. **Customers**

Many of the customers listed on the website are HUGE players in the tech space.  Some of these are security companies, and all are large enough to do an acquisition of cybersecurity technology for $100M-$200M.

📷

* **Microsoft – market cap $1.7T+**

There are lots of articles and PRs on the Microsoft partnership –

* [Cyren Integrates Additional Web Security Into Microsoft's Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyren-integrates-additional-web-security-into-microsofts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection-atp-300786293.html)

* Rackspace – market cap $4B
* Forcepoint, Web.com, Sophos, Watchgard – all were previously public and now are private equity

NOTE - the companies in **bold** have acquired companies in security and/or in Israel.

d. **Partnerships**

Some of these customers they talk about as partners – like Microsoft.  It isn’t clear if Microsoft is reselling Cyren products or just using their technology.  But the most recent press release in January makes it sound like they helping to sell the new CIS product.

* **Microsoft** \- [Cyren Inbox Security and Incident Response Service Expands Availability Through Azure Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-inbox-security-incident-response-131500765.html)
* **Palo Alto Networks** \-[ Cyren Joins Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-joins-palo-alto-networks-131500275.html)

[They also said on the Q4 quarterly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) call that Palo Alto has big penetration into global 2000 and Fortune 100 enterprises – maybe this opens the door for more enterprise customers –

**""Additionally, we are pleased to announce a partnership with Palo Alto Networks**, one of the industry leaders in cloud security. We've recently integrated our enterprise threat intelligence solution threat in depth with Palo Alto's Cortex XSOAR platform, which is a leading security orchestration, automation and response platform. Cortex SOAR is used by security teams in **34% of the global 2,000 and 65% of the Fortune 100 enterprises** to simplify and harmonize security operations across an enterprise.""

I found the $PANW partnership even more interesting because (a) their founder is Israeli, and (b) they have acquired so many companies in Israel (see below).

e. **Recent Funding**

Cyren's most recent funding was [closed in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-closing-13-8-154500221.html) \- $13.8 million at $1.15 per share.  A week before the offering, the stock was trading at $1.40+, including one after hours session it spiked to over $2.00.

Look at the trading volumes since mid-December – average volume up 40X!

It is much easier to get in and out of the stock now than it was a year ago.

* 30-day average volume Dec 16 – Jan 15:  avg 1.13M shares/day
* 30-day average volume Jan 16 – Feb 15:  avg 2.87M shares/day
* 30-day average volume Feb 16 – Mar 15:  avg 3.62M shares/day

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

* **Palo Alto Networks** \- Nir Zuk Israeli founder (formerly Check Point).  Acquired 8 different Israel companies since 2014.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report)

*US-based cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks said Tuesday it has acquired Israeli startup Bridgecrew for $156 million in cash, confirming an earlier report in the Calcalist financial website.*

*The US-based firm has made a number of acquisitions in Israel, including* [*Cyvera*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cyvera) *for $200 million in 2014;* [*LightCyber*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/light-cyber) *for $130 million in 2017;* [*CyberCubes*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cybercubes) *and* [*Secdo*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/secdo) *in 2018; and* [*Twistlock*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/twistlock) *for $410 million,* [*PureSec*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/puresec)*, and* [*Demisto*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-to-buy-israeli-cybersecurity-firm-demisto-for-560-million) *for $560 million in 2019, according to data compiled by Start-Up Nation Central.*

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""While Q3 revenues were down slightly year-over-year, it is important to point out that our results **do not yet reflect material contribution from our growth initiatives**, although significant progress on that front was made in the quarter.

The **revenue decrease is primarily related to the end-of-life of some of our legacy offerings** on the Cyren Cloud Security platform, including Cyren Web Security, and the installed base is winding down through 2020 and into mid-2021. The lower revenue recognition during the period is partially attributed to the decline of revenues associated with those products.""

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""As we discussed on prior calls, 2020 was a transition year for Cyren as we retired a number of legacy SMB products in order to focus on new enterprise products introduced this year, and as such, **revenues were expected to decline until the impact from new products offset the loss of revenue from discontinued products**.

As Brett mentioned previously, we saw good traction in the fourth quarter as revenue recognition from **CIS increased 140% quarter-over-quarter**. Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

c. **Customers**

Many of the customers listed on the website are HUGE players in the tech space.  Some of these are security companies, and all are large enough to do an acquisition of cybersecurity technology for $100M-$200M.

* **Microsoft – market cap $1.7T+**

There are lots of articles and PRs on the Microsoft partnership –

NOTE - the companies in **bold** have acquired companies in security and/or in Israel.

d. **Partnerships**

Some of these customers they talk about as partners – like Microsoft.  It isn’t clear if Microsoft is reselling Cyren products or just using their technology.  But the most recent press release in January makes it sound like they helping to sell the new CIS product.

* **Microsoft** \- [Cyren Inbox Security and Incident Response Service Expands Availability Through Azure Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-inbox-security-incident-response-131500765.html)
* **Palo Alto Networks** \-[ Cyren Joins Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-joins-palo-alto-networks-131500275.html)

[They also said on the Q4 quarterly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) call that Palo Alto has big penetration into global 2000 and Fortune 100 enterprises – maybe this opens the door for more enterprise customers –

**""Additionally, we are pleased to announce a partnership with Palo Alto Networks**, one of the industry leaders in cloud security. We've recently integrated our enterprise threat intelligence solution threat in depth with Palo Alto's Cortex XSOAR platform, which is a leading security orchestration, automation and response platform. Cortex SOAR is used by security teams in **34% of the global 2,000 and 65% of the Fortune 100 enterprises** to simplify and harmonize security operations across an enterprise.""

I found the $PANW partnership even more interesting because (a) their founder is Israeli, and (b) they have acquired so many companies in Israel (see below).

e. **Recent Funding**

Cyren's most recent funding was [closed in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-closing-13-8-154500221.html) \- $13.8 million at $1.15 per share.  A week before the offering, the stock was trading at $1.40+, including one after hours session it spiked to over $2.00.

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

* **Palo Alto Networks** \- Nir Zuk Israeli founder (formerly Check Point).  Acquired 8 different Israel companies since 2014.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report)

*US-based cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks said Tuesday it has acquired Israeli startup Bridgecrew for $156 million in cash, confirming an earlier report in the Calcalist financial website.*

*The US-based firm has made a number of acquisitions in Israel, including* [*Cyvera*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cyvera) *for $200 million in 2014;* [*LightCyber*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/light-cyber) *for $130 million in 2017;* [*CyberCubes*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cybercubes) *and* [*Secdo*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/secdo) *in 2018; and* [*Twistlock*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/twistlock) *for $410 million,* [*PureSec*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/puresec)*, and* [*Demisto*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-to-buy-israeli-cybersecurity-firm-demisto-for-560-million) *for $560 million in 2019, according to data compiled by Start-Up Nation Central.*

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

Salesforce has experienced accelerated growth in its cloud CRM and consulting services as Enterprise customers accelerated their transitions from legacy and on premise solutions in favor of Salesforce’s. High margin consulting exploded on Q1 as Enterprises ramped up on boarding in Q1 ahead of Covid19. I expect a solid beat with a 5-8% move in the next few days.

f6xhl7_ZS,ZS,Zscaler 2/20/2020 AMC - Guidance matters most.," 

Stock: ZScaler **(ZS)**

Direction: **mildly bullish** 

**Price Target:** **65$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** This stock is a great example of a growth stock. Fundamental ratios such as PE, sales to earnings, cashflow etc are all way out of reasonable ranges. However, we’re also looking at 35% revenue growth year over year, and the industry is extremely bullish due to the shift into cloud and digital. Looking at comparable peers using Price to sales, we can still say ZS is relatively overpriced even amongst its peers. This is primarily a bet on further growth potential of the company, hence the growth categorization.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 68, nearing overbought, but turning downwards. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement of about 10.1% or 6.31$.

**Sentimental**: Zscaler is the best-in-class for cyber security and has superior product selection and features vs competitors like palo alto networks. It has accrued a decent short interest of about 9% float and 6 days to cover approximately. While ZS has beaten earnings since its IPO, the stock price tends to hang over on guidance due to the growth nature of this stock. Given the short interest, if the stock trends flat or upwards, we should see some minor short covering. 

**ROI: 20%**

**Risk Level: 4 out of 5, Very Risky**
